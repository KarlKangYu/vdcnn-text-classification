However the statement by the group also said that the "permanent ceasefire" announced in March remained in effect.
In response, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said he could not see how the nine-month-old peace process could resume.
After the 30 December bombing he said dialogue with Eta was "finished".
The group's latest statement was sent to the Basque pro-independence Gara newspaper.
Eta said it had given advance warning of the attack and condemned the fact that the targeted building had not been evacuated.
The statement came after two suspected Eta militants were arrested in neighbouring France.
Last week, Spanish police discovered two caches of bomb-making equipment and explosives in the Basque country.
Officials said 100kg of explosives were found on Thursday, ready to be used in a bomb, and a smaller stash was discovered nearby on Friday.
They have not linked the weapons directly with the Madrid blast, which flattened a five-storey building.
The two deaths at the airport were the first attributed to Eta in more than three years.
The group is seeking an independent state in northern Spain and south-west France.
Lost luggage, flight cancellations and problems with tickets - particularly for those booked over the internet and by telephone - were among the most common complaints.
The Air Transport Users Council (AUC) said there was also "little evidence" that airlines were showing "any real concern about the impact on passengers of damaged, delayed or lost luggage".
The AUC said it was especially worried about budget airline Ryanair which, it claimed, often displayed a poor attitude towards its customers.
Overall, Ryanair was the third most complained about airline - receiving 77 written complaints, compared with 117 for the biggest carrier, British Airways, and 110 for Air France.
The AUC, the official consumer watchdog for the airline industry, has not previously revealed airlines' complaints total.
Ryanair's complaints tally compared with 42 for rival budget carrier Easyjet and 32 for Go.
But Ryanair director Michael Cawley dismissed the AUC's findings.
He said Ryanair received only 77 written complaints through the AUC in a year when it had carried 11 million passengers.
While traffic levels had increased by 40 per cent over the year, the number of complaints had fallen from 138.
Ryanair responded to complaints within seven days, he said, and complaints via the AUC were down by more than 50 per cent.
The council said part of the reason for the decline was because Ryanair was refusing to work with it.
"We therefore do not encourage callers to our telephone advice line to send us copies of their correspondence with Ryanair, even if the complaint is of the type we would normally take up with an airline," a council spokesman said.
But Mr Cawley said Ryanair chiefs refused to work with the AUC because it failed to address serious issues including travel agency commission and airport charges, which increased costs.
British Airways, which topped the complaints table, said the numbers should be put into perspective as it was "by far the largest airline" on the list.
A BA spokeswoman said that, while it had received "117 complaints too many", the airline carried 40 million passengers a year, "so those figures equate to one complaint per 350,000 passengers".
The consumer watchdog received written complaints against 120 different airlines last year.
Overall, the AUC received 1,163 written complaints in the year to April, compared with 1,417 in 2000-01.
Telephone complaints increased by 14% to 4,252.
Problems with tickets frequently included passengers' names being wrong and airlines refusing to replace lost tickets or change flight times.
Mr Hamer suggests people should print off the internet page before the final "send" or "confirm", as well as printing off the confirmation.
White House spokesman Sean McCormack said that Mr Schroeder had made the phone call to the US president expressing the hope the two countries could have "good working relations".
"The president's response is that he's interested in getting down to business, moving forward on common agenda items," Mr McCormack said.
The resumption of the relationship coincides with a visit to the US by German Defence Minister Peter Struck, who held talks with US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Saturday at the Pentagon on the issue of Iraq.
Mr Rumsfeld later pronounced relations between the two countries to be "unpoisoned".
"Germany is a long-standing ally of the United Statesin Nato and, needless to say, we value that relationship and the friendship of the German people," he said.
Relations between the two countries soured in September when, during the German election campaign, Mr Schroeder repeatedly voiced his opposition to military action against Iraq - a position which angered the US.
An angry Mr Rumsfeld said that Mr Schroeder's election campaign had had the effect of "poisoning the relationship" between the two countries.
Ms Daeubler-Gmelin denied making the remarks, for which Mr Schroeder apologised, but was subsequently left out of Mr Schroeder's coalition government.
Analysts said that Germany, which was once Washington's most obedient ally, found itself frozen out while America's sometimes difficult partner, France, took over diplomatic manoeuvring on the Iraq issue.
Mr Bush delayed calling the German chancellor to offer congratulations over his narrow election win, and Mr Rumsfeld pointedly refused to meet his German counterpart at a Nato meeting in Warsaw.
Germany later offered to head the international peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, along with the Netherlands, in a move widely regarded as a bridge-building exercise to the US.
And although Germany continues to assert that it will not join a US-led attack on Iraq, Mr Struck said, at a press conference following his meeting with Mr Rumsfeld, that the US policy of working through the United Nations was a positive step.
"The line and the approach of President Bush to co-operate with or to go through the United Nations, to choose the way of multilateral approach, has proven to be correct," he said.
More than half of the continent's 400 butterfly species could become extinct as a result of climate change, scientists say.
Boyd's forest dragon, a rare forest lizard, is also at high risk because it allows its body temperature to fluctuate with that of the outside environment.
Even small climate changes in flat areas of the nation - such as the Amazon forest - could force species to move unrealistic distances in an attempt to survive.
More than 2,000 native tree species in the country's Cerrado, one of the world's richest savannah regions, could also become extinct.
Scientists also said that the Scottish crossbill, found only in Scotland, might have to move to Iceland because of global warming - but they warned it was unlikely the bird would survive the move.
Threatened Mexican species include the smokey pocket gopher, the Alcorn'spocket gopher, the Jico deer mouse and the cape pygmy owl.
Among the most vulnerable Mexican butterfly species are the Oaxacan swallowtail and the Howarth's white.
A recent drought has already had a severe impact on a Proteaceae species called the toffee apple conebush.
Major conservation areas such as Kruger National Park also risk losing up to 60% of the species under their protection.
Climate change has already been implicated in the extinction of the country's golden toad after a drought.
The species disappeared from a large nature reserve where its habitat had been protected.

The 30-year-old suffered a shoulder dislocation last October while playing for the Sharks against Cardiff Blues in the Heineken Cup.
Sheridan underwent two separate operations to repair the injury to his left shoulder and long-standing damage on his right.
"I feel like I owe Sale a lot so I'd like to have a good season," he said.
Sheridan, who was named in England's Elite Player Squad by Martin Johnson, managed just five games for Sale last season, while his last cap for his country came back in March 2009.
Sale narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership last season and Sheridan said it was frustrating watching from the sidelines.
"In some ways I suppose I do almost feel like a new player having had surgery on both shoulders," said the British and Irish Lions international.

Malaysian political scientist and human rights activist Farish A Noor reflects on the reasons for the rising violence.
I've crossed the Thai-Malaysian border many times before, doing research on social and religious movements there.
As a Malaysian it's never seemed to me as a crossing into the unfamiliar.
On the day that I crossed the border into Thailand through the seedy town of Golok, a man was shot in the back of his head and left dead, face-down, in front of the market.
This year alone, more than 500 people have been killed by both militant groups and the Thai security forces.
Everywhere I went I saw police and army roadblocks, manned by young soldiers who nervously kept their fingers on the triggers of their guns.
The poor fellow was clearly nervous of me on my motorbike, as many of the shootings that have taken place were drive-by killings with the assassins riding motorcycles.
The soldier looked like he was in his late teens - without his uniform, he could have passed as one of my students.
His fear, though, was real enough, for the situation in Pattani is rapidly deteriorating.
The crowd had gathered in support of some local Muslim leaders who had been arrested on the grounds that they may have some links with the mysterious militants operating in the region.
Ordered to strip down and lie on the ground, the protesters were then made to crawl on their bellies to the waiting trucks and crammed into them by the dozens.
Packed in like livestock they were piled on top of one another and then driven off to a detention centre five hours away.
In the course of the journey nearly 80 of the protesters suffocated to death or were crushed in the trucks.
Thailand's slide into inter-religious conflict seems to be part and parcel of the country's slide towards a more authoritarian form of politics.
When Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in 2001, he and his party claimed that they would restore law and order.
Their first campaign was against the drug cartels and criminal networks in the country.
Following the Bali bombing in 2002 Thaksin was also one of the first leaders in the region to embrace President Bush's "global campaign against terror", and since then the security forces of Thailand have been on the hunt for alleged Islamic militants in the South.
Both Southern Thailand and Northern Malaysia were once part of a Malay-Muslim kingdom that was split apart thanks to the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.
The British colonial government claimed Kelantan and Pattani was unceremoniously handed over to the Thais.
I have come to know the area of Pattani-Kelantan quite well by now, thanks to my research there.
At the markets of Southern Thailand one comes across goods that are typical of any poor rural locality - fruits and vegetables, fish and meat, farmers' tools and some local handicrafts.
Occasionally one runs into an Osama Bin Laden T-shirt as well.
At the local market I decided to interview a young man who was selling them.
"Who buys these T-shirts?" was my next question.
"So why do you sell these T-shirts then?" I asked him.
"But Bangkok is more interested in supporting the Americans and the Americans hate Osama.
During my recent trip to Pattani I had the distinct feeling that the mood had changed in the region.
The people were as poor as before, but also more angry about their state and what was happening in the world around them.
That impression was confirmed when I visited one of the local religious schools.
The school itself was a small wooden structure, a simple hut with a zinc roof.
The little boys who go to the school were just like kids anywhere else - playful and mischievous in their white robes and little green turbans.
But speaking to their teachers I sensed the tension that was beneath the surface.
"We don't know who's behind it, this is something new for all of us.
In the past our struggle was political, but now it's becoming a religious issue.
For so long the authorities turned a blind eye to all the smuggling that took place here, and now the whole area is swimming with guns and weapons.
The militants who are doing the killing are a small minority, but instead all of us Muslims are being blamed for it.
I noticed the teacher's clenched fists, as he talked about the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay.
At another school I picked up a text entitled 'Jihad in Pattani', that spoke of a global campaign against Muslims the world over.
In all my years of visiting and researching in Pattani, I have never read anything like it.
This is not the Pattani I once knew.
Back in my office and sitting in front of my computer, my mind went back to the young, smiling, boy selling his Osama T-shirts; racing on the highways with his girlfriend.
What would it take for him to cross that final, invisible line, and take Osama into his heart? What would drive anyone to express his frustration and anger through violence?
Already a spate of killings have claimed the lives of other innocents.
A few days after the deaths of the eighty Muslim protesters at Tak Bai, a Buddhist monk was murdered by militants who claimed that this was an act of revenge.
So far those killed include the poor and the ordinary - policemen, teachers, farmers and monks.
On Sunday, the firm confirmed it had received a takeover approach - thought to be from Dubai Ports World, owned by the United Arab Emirates government.
But press reports have also suggested that Denmark's AP Moeller Maersk and Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison could now join the bidding.
As a result, shares in P&O closed up 30% at 404 pence on Monday.
The Gulf firm manages ports in Asia, Europe, Australia and South America, and P&O owns ports around the world.
Last week P&O, which has been slimming down its ferries and property arms, cut back earnings expectations for its key ports business.
In the past year there has been strong growth at its Asian ports, but that has been offset by more sluggish economic conditions in the UK and Australia.
Any takeover would bring to an end 168 years of history at the UK based firm - whose full name is Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation - which started life carrying cargoes to all corners of the British Empire.
Frank Kennedy , maritime consultant for the UK firm Murray Fenton Middle East based in Dubai, said the company would be a popular target.
"Four or five years ago the industry was in a lull, ship owners were losing money, there was a lot of problems and ports were losing money," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
He added that P&O could be an attractive target for the Dubai government which has "evolved and expanded" its ports operations from the United Arab Emirates where it started off with two ports into port management around the world.
"I think when they (the Dubai government) see an opportunity they will take it," Mr Kennedy added.
In an effort to cut costs P&O has sold properties, slashed jobs and cut routes at its loss-making ferry operations as it lost market share to budget airlines.
Figures show rates of MRSA are falling but as vice-president of the Patient's Association, Sir Richard says he wants to see a much "tougher line" including the sacking of managers who fail to enforce patient safety standards.
Experts use the term healthcare-associated infection and it encompasses all infections that are caught in hospital or as a result of treatment.
MRSA is the antibiotic resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus - a bug that lives on the skin but can cause infection when it has the chance to enter the body, for example through a wound or during surgery.
It mainly affects the over 65s.
Both these infections have been at the centre of government policy to tackle healthcare-associated infections but they are not the only problematic infections in hospital.
Figures published by the Health Protection Agency in December show that there were 725 MRSA bloodstream infections reported in England during the July to September quarter of 2008.
This is a 13% decrease on the previous when 837 reports were received and a 33% reduction in the corresponding quarter of 2007 when 1,082 reports were received.
By summer 2008 the government had hit its target of halving cases of MRSA from the 2003/04 figures.
However the government's healthcare watchdog has warned that the figures mask large variation between different hospitals and some are not achieving the infection control they should be.
Compared with the same period last year the number of cases fell by 38%.
A spokesman for the Department of Health said they had introduced a "raft of measures" to tackle healthcare-associated infections, including more matrons to enforce hygiene standards and a "deep clean" of all hospitals in England.
A "Clean, Safe Care" strategy to tackle healthcare-associated infections in the NHS is backed by funding of �270m a year, he said.
There are also plans to introduce MRSA screening for all elective patients by March 2009, and for all emergency patients as soon as possible over the next three years.
In 2006, the hygiene code was introduced in response to a report from the Healthcare Commission warning of poor standards of cleanliness in a significant proportion of hospitals in England.
The hygiene code lists the actions that NHS organisations in England must take to ensure the risk of infection is kept as low as possible.
Compliance with the code has been monitored since 2007.
While figures suggest that strategies employed to reduce rates of healthcare-associated infection have had an effect, experts routinely warn that more work is needed and it is vital not to become complacent.
There has been much debate about the validity of the approach taken so far and some steps such as the multi-million pound "deep-clean" initiative were criticised in some quarters for being little more than a publicity stunt.
News that the target to halve MRSA bloodstream infections had been hit was quickly followed by a report from the Healthcare Commission warning that a quarter of trusts were struggling to meet the hygiene code.
It also showed just over half of hospitals had managed a sustained reduction in MRSA rates.
Anna Walker, chief executive of the Healthcare Commission said more needed to be done with some trusts still having "some way to go" on the basics.
The Department of Health said it had taken "tough actions" which are "clearly making an impact".
Sir Richard Branson has called for screening of MRSA among NHS staff.
One expert, Professor Mark Enright from Imperial College said the idea made sense but would be expensive to implement.
A spokesman for the Department of Health said professional guidance had not recommended routine screening of staff for MRSA.
Cancer Research UK analysis suggests that by 2024, 40 per 100,000 people will get the cancer compared with the current rate of 50 per 100,000.
Researchers said measures such as the smoking ban meant the number of smokers would continue to fall.
But they warned the ageing population meant the number living with the disease could actually increase.
Lung cancer mostly strikes older age groups due to the delay between smoking and the onset of the disease.
The researchers said that meant the actual number of people with lung cancer could rise from 38,500 to more than 41,600 by 2024.
Smoking causes around 90% of lung cancers and men are more likely to suffer than women due to the fact they have been more likely to smoke.
The Cancer Research UK team analysed disease and population data from organisations such as the Office for National Statistics.
They predict that by 2024 there will be 18,000 women a year being diagnosed and 22,000 men.
Cancer rates have been falling since the early 1970s when more than 150 men per 100,000 were diagnosed with the disease, reflecting the peak in smoking rates in the 1940s and 1950s.
She had no time to change or gather her possessions when the Israeli police arrived in the early hours of Sunday morning.
In borrowed shoes, she shows us around the tent that she now calls home near the single-storey, two room house in East Jerusalem.
Jewish Israelis who had already moved into the extension the Kurd family had built for their son, have now taken over the rest of the flat.
Mohammad al-Kurd, 55, who is partially paralysed and suffers from heart and kidney problems, diabetes and high blood pressure, is now staying with relatives.
He had lived in the house for 52 years when the Israeli Supreme Court served an eviction order on him in July.
The eviction is the culmination of a decades-long legal dispute between the Kurd family and organisations seeking to boost Jewish residency in the Israeli-occupied east of the city.
The case, followed closely by international activists, goes to the heart of one of the most hotly-contested issues in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks - the status of Jerusalem.
Palestinians fear an Israeli drive to create "facts on the ground" in the part of the city where Palestinians are the majority and want to locate the capital of a future state.
Israel considers all of Jerusalem its capital and has annexed to the east of the city and extended its municipal boundaries into the West Bank.
But the international community sees it as occupied, along with the West Bank, since the 1967 Israeli-Arab war.
The few houses draped in blue and white Israeli flags with their own armed guards, amid a cluster of cream stone Arab-style properties, are therefore considered illegal settlements under international law.
Their inhabitants will not speak to the media.
But Daniel Luria of Ateret Cohanim, an organisation which promotes Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem says "nobody's forcing anyone out - the courts ruled they [the Kurds] were living there illegally".
The Kurd family were among some 700,000 Arabs who fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war that followed the creation of Israel.
Jordan, which controlled the West Bank and East Jerusalem after the war, and the UN housed them and several other families on the plot of land.
But after 1967, a Jewish association laid claim to it in the courts on the basis of Ottoman-era documents.
An Israeli lawyer working for the Kurd family agreed to relinquish their ownership claim to the land in exchange for "protected tenancy status".
The family maintain they were unaware he was doing this and fired him as soon as they found out.
July's court ruling followed a labyrinthine legal battle, but was apparently based on the Kurd family's refusal to pay rent to a trust fund established in case the Jewish claim was finally validated.
Since 2001, a group of Jewish settlers has been living in the Kurds' extension.
Their argument is that it was built without official permission - as is much Palestinian construction in East Jerusalem because the Israeli authorities rarely grant building permits.
Both sides say the other harassed them as they lived side by side, the front doors metres apart.
Mrs Kurd said her Jewish neighbours would teach their children to shoot toy guns at pictures of Palestinian children; the Jews have said they had excrement and stones thrown at them by local Arabs.
Jewish groups also point out that the house is near the site held to be the burial place of 3rd Century BCE Jewish high priest Shimon Hatzadik, and an old synagogue there was used as a rubbish dump and goat shed until they sought access to clean it up.
Mr Luria says that the eviction is an unusual case.
Counting just over 100 families that have moved into about five sites in what he calls the "Holy Basin" around Jerusalem's Old City in the past five years, he says most cases are straightforward transactions.
The sales are usually at inflated prices, sometimes done through middle men to protect the vendors from recriminations.
Mrs Kurd says she turned down an offer of US$10m for her modest apartment.
Daniel Siederman, a left-wing lawyer specialising in Jerusalem, says the location is one of several targeted by Jewish organisations which effectively ring the Old City, home to Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites.
He says the situation is very different for Palestinians trying to reclaim pre-1948 property from what is now Israel.
To Mr Luria, the Green Line - the 1949 ceasefire line - between East and West Jerusalem is meaningless, whatever the international community says.
But the Kurds are currently mounting a legal challenge, based on Jordanian documents which have recently come to light.
That is the conclusion of experts at the United Nations University, who say that a new definition of "environmental refugee" is urgently needed.
They believe that already environmental degradation forces as many people away from their homes as political and social unrest.
The UNU issued its statement to mark UN Day for Disaster Reduction.
"There are many different environmental issues involved and there can be interactions between them," said Janos Bogardi, director of the United Nations University's Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) in Bonn, Germany.
"In poorer rural areas especially, one of the biggest sources of refugees is land degradation and desertification, which may be caused by unsustainable land use interacting with climate change, amplified by population growth," he told the BBC News website.
The projected figure of 50 million is derived from a number of previous reports, including the 1999 World Disasters Report from the International Red Cross.
This calculated that natural disasters in the previous year had created more refugees than wars or other armed conflicts.
It said that falling soil fertility, drought, flooding and deforestation drove 25 million people from their homes, with many of these environmental refugees joining already fragile urban squatter communities.
"We need to define what we mean by political, economic and environmental refugees," said the UNU's Rector Hans van Ginkel.
"If we define the problem better, we can prepare for the level of need to be catered for," he told the BBC News website.
Another issue is that historically, people are considered refugees only when they go to another country, whereas as Hurricane Katrina has graphically shown, those displaced by environmental damage often remain within their native country.
New Home Office guidelines say families should now receive documentary evidence about the death before the official inquest.
The move follows a recommendation in Sir William Macpherson's report into the death of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Home Office Minister Paul Boateng acknowledged that the practice of not disclosing evidence before the inquest was damaging confidence in the police.
The guidelines will cover cases of deaths in police detention or those which resulted from the actions of a police officer.
Campaign group Inquest said the move was a "step forward" on a very important issue.
Inquest co-director Helen Shaw said the lack of information meant families sometimes heard about their loved ones' last hours in a room full of lawyers and the general public, which only added to their distress.
But she warned the guidelines were still only voluntary, and said a change in the law may be necessary to ensure that all information was disclosed to families.
Many of the most controversial deaths in custody when police restraints were used involved people from ethnic minorities.
The cases of Joy Gardner, Brian Douglas, Wayne Douglas, Ibrahima Sey and Roger Sylvester have kept the issue high-profile.
In his first interview since being released from Standford Hill Open Prison, Mr Aitken said being put behind bars had been a rough test.
And he felt he was in a "fraternity of the fallen", as he believed there was no distinction between himself, a perjurer, and other criminals including murderers.
Mr Aitken was speaking on the BBC's Breakfast With Frost programme, where he admitted he had prepared himself spiritually and physically for jail - although there were still shocks.
Mr Aitken said he did not judge the other prisoners as "we were all on the floor together".
"I felt on exactly the same level as all of them.
Mr Aitken was jailed for 18 months in June 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice.
He had admitted both charges following the collapse of his libel case against The Guardian and World in Action.
Mr Aitken said he believed he was still a member of the Conservative Party but would resign if asked to.
He was not upset that his potentially huge political career was cut short, adding he felt more of a "deep sadness for the people he loved and let down".
However, a role in public life would interest him in the future.
His book about his dramatic downfall, Pride and Perjury, is due to be published soon.
Five-year-old Leah Preston remains at Birmingham children's hospital where she underwent a second explorative operation on wounds suffered during the attack.
Leah was playing in her front garden in Hawsford Crescent, Low Hill, when she was attacked by the bull terriers on Thursday.
The two dogs then turned on their owner, next-door neighbour Jean Harvey, and her two young children.
Leah suffered bite wounds to her legs, arms and scalp.
"She was fine overnight and today she is in a stable condition," a spokeswoman for the hospital said.
Surgeons say Leah has lost tissue and will need extensive reconstructive plastic surgery in the future.
West Midlands police officers are investigating the incident on Thursday in which the two dogs are thought to have escaped from a metal cage.
Chief Superintendent Tom Duffin said arrests were possible.
"Whilst our emotions are initially around the anxiety and trauma caused, it is clear to everyone that these animals were dangerous.
"We need to inquire into what happened to see if any criminal offences have been disclosed," he said.
Family friend Carol Read arrived in the middle of the attack.
"Then I saw there was one dog going for Leah's throat.
Police wearing bullet-proof vests were called to the houses and the dogs were destroyed after being captured by vets.
Ms Harvey and her two children were treated for dog bites at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.
During a clinical trail, researchers at Newcastle University gave Iosartan, normally prescribed for hypertension, to 14 people with Hepatitis C.
All the patients had liver scarring, but in half of them the scars shrank, allowing the organ to repair itself.
The findings are described as promising and further studies are planned.
These would involve patients with liver disease caused by obesity and then, to follow, alcohol, hereditary and autoimmune diseases.

Richards succeeded BAR founder Craig Pollock at the helm the day before the launch of the 2002 car.
The team finished eighth in the constructors' championship last year, with seven points, while undergoing a complete overhaul of their operation.
Now Richards believes that process is complete and is looking for an immediate improvement in on-track performance.
"It was a pretty bad mess," Richards said of the situation he found at the start of the 2002 season.
"It was [run by] a group of people that had wonderful ambition, a great dream, but no idea how to get there.
"The last 12 months has really been putting this team back on track and getting their feet firmly planted on the ground.
Richards expects Ferrari to be the dominant force in F1 yet again this season.
But he is hopeful his driver line-up of 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve and new team-mate Jenson Button can put BAR among the best of the rest.
"I believe we have made a very significant step forward," said Richards.
On the night of the 5 August there were warnings of air raids so I had to take our unit's communications equipment to a bunker 2km from our barracks.

She is one of the 500 children at the Roverpally primary school, 41 kilometres north of the capital Dhaka, who can use a computer for free.
Even at her young age, she knows computers can make a difference in her life.
But the country's largest non-governmental organisation, Brac, is trying to change all this by putting computers in rural schools.
Brac runs a network of 650 school libraries in rural Bangladesh.
"This is the age of the computer," said the headmaster Mohammed Abdus Sabur.
Setting up computer centres in the libraries is an expensive business, with the computers costing US$2,000 each.
The situation is complicated by unreliable electricity supply and the high humidity.
"They are trying to make information communication technology a priority, particularly in light of the software industry in India," said internet commentator Partha Pratim Sarker of the Bytes For All technology website.
At the Roverpally school, the three computers are fenced off in a glass booth in a corner of the library.
"With this game they learn how to get a good score and they are getting comfortable with the mouse," said librarian Selina Akhter.
When they are older, they can hope to learn about the web.
The school is the first one to be hooked up to the internet in a trial project, so that children can browse the net and send e-mails.
It connects to the net over a wireless link to Brac headquarters in Dhaka, as this is cheaper and more reliable than using the telephone network.
"Although the children might not totally understand how the internet works or be able to read the newspaper on the screen, I read it to them and they can look at the pictures," said Ms Akhter.
The school library is the only place in the village connected to the internet.
Farmers can also use the internet to check crop prices and find out, for example, that they would get 10 times as much if they sold their pineapples in Dhaka than at the local market.
The measures are included in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill.
The bill proposes an increase in the age limit for buying knives from 16 to 18, and search powers for head teachers who suspect they are being carried.
Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair backed the move as "very sensible", but called for new powers allowing licensees to search customers.
The bill applies to England and Wales, with the weapons provisions also applying in Scotland.
Binge drinking-related disorder will also be addressed in the bill, with proposed plans such as suspending alcohol sales in bars that persistently sell to minors.
The proposals are part of the government's attempt to restore "respect" in communities, town centres, and schools, which it says is among its top priorities.
The planned legislation envisages higher sentences for carrying imitation guns, and tougher manufacturing standards to make sure replicas cannot be converted to fire real ammunition.
Sir Ian, speaking at the launch of the Safer London Foundation, a crime prevention charity backed by the Met, said the police had also been calling for alcohol disorder zones.
He said he hoped the bill could be altered to allow licensees of some nightclubs to search customers for knives and guns.
Chief Superintendent Paul Robinson, who heads Scotland Yard's special firearms operational command unit, welcomed the proposed ban on replica weapon sales.
"It is often almost impossible to tell the difference between a real gun and a replica," he said.
He predicted the move would result in a drop in armed robberies and firearms incidents.
It was feared that those who use imitation firearms in films and on television, and children who play with water pistols or toy guns, could be criminalised.
But the bill has been drafted so the ban will exclude people who fall into these categories.
Air weapons are also being targeted, with the age limit for buying or firing one without supervision being raised from 17 to 18.
It will also become an offence to use other people to hide or carry guns or knives.
Knives remain the weapon most commonly used in violent incidents, prompting the minimum age at which they can be bought to be raised from 16 to 18.
New powers to create designated Alcohol Disorder Zones, first aired in January, are being pursued in the bill.
The Home Office has said the "last resort" option would allow senior police officers and councils to pinpoint areas with binge drinking-related problems and levy an extra charge for policing on all licensed premises in the zone.
The law would give police the authority to ban the sale of alcohol for up to 48 hours in pubs where under-18s have been served.
They could also bar individuals responsible for alcohol-fuelled disorder from an area for up to 48 hours.
Drinking banning orders could see troublemakers excluded from specific areas and bars for up to two years.
Leisure industry representatives have attacked the proposal to levy charges on pubs and clubs, claiming some venues could face an unfair �100-per-week bill.
Ama Sumani's friend Janet Symmons said pledges of money had been "flooding in" to the appeal, which is being run out of an African craft store in the city.
Ms Sumani, 39, had been receiving dialysis at a Cardiff hospital after cancer damaged her kidneys.
But she cannot afford this care, which is prolonging her life, in Ghana.
Speaking from the country's capital city Accra, Ms Sumani thanked all the people fighting her case in Britain.
"My big thanks to all of them," she said.
Ms Symmons said the Friends of Ama committee set up to help Ms Sumani, was made up of a number of different members of the local African community.
It is based in the Xquisite Africa shop on City Road in Roath in the city.
"The public response has been tremendous," she said.
"We have had a call from a lady in Llandudno who says she is willing to pay for all the hospital bills.
UK officials said they had checked medical treatment was available in Ghana before Mrs Sumani was flown home.
Less than 24 hours after being removed from the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, she attended the main hospital in Accra.
The mother-of-two said the hospital had then asked for the equivalent of about $6,000 (�3,060) to cover her kidney dialysis sessions for the next three months.
A hospital official in Ghana said Mrs Sumani had been accompanied by British immigration officials, who had offered to pay for the first three months' treatment.
However, he said the hospital could not help her as she had no source of funding for the ongoing medical care she required.
Ms Sumani has a type of cancer - malignant myeloma - which has damaged her kidneys.
She had been receiving dialysis three times a week in the UK before she was sent home with an expired visa.
Ms Symmons said Ms Sumani was now accompanied by the BBC's west Africa correspondent Will Ross, who had helped her with accommodation, food and trying to get dialysis.
Rev Aled Edwards from Cytun, Churches Together in Wales, called for a judicial review of the case.
"I am greatly concerned after looking at the papers and consulting with her friends about the legal case here," he said.
On Friday, Ghana's High Commissioner in London Annan Cato urged the UK government to allow Ms Sumani back.
In a statement, the Border and Immigration Agency said it examined with great care each individual case before removal.
Newsround's Helen went to a school in Scotland where kids are trying out a new way of learning by making and playing computer games during their lessons.
"My favourite part was making my world and finding out all the information," said ten-year-old Lauren.
And nine-year-old Ross said using the game was much better than writing in a book.
Thought to be the first fly driven to extinction by humans, it was also considered one of Europe's few endemic animals to have disappeared for good.
The bizarre fly was considered 'mythical' due to its orange head, its preference for living on dead animal carcasses, and the fact it was rarely sighted even in the 19th Century.
The discovery of the fly living in Spain is "sensational", say scientists.
It preferred to live in the cool season, whereas most flies like warmer temperatures.
It lived on the carcasses of dead animals that are in the advanced stages of decay, whereas most carrion flies prefer less rotten flesh.
The fly was also said to have had an orange head that would glow in the dark, with some 19th Century scientists writing about how it could be found at night due to its luminous shine.
And 50 years after being described, the fly suddenly disappeared, supposedly for good, with the last sighting in 1849.
Many aspects of its biology remained unknown, but the fly's niche lifestyle was thought to have contributed to its extinction, as some experts speculated that it had a preference for crushed bones, in which it would lay eggs that turned into maggots.
Changes in livestock management in central Europe, improved carrion disposal following the Industrial Revolution, as well as the eradication of wolves and other big bone-crushing carnivores could have helped eliminate the fly.
However, Dr Martín-Vega and colleagues have found the fly living in two separate regions in Spain.
Dr Martín-Vega's team were researching carrion flies in the country in a bid to help police forensic teams.
They use the appearance of flies on corpses to help determine where and when a body may have died and how long it has been decomposing.
Around Madrid, the researchers use carrion-baited traps to catch more than 50,000 flies which have been studied and catalogued.
He and his colleagues have published details of this new discovery in the journal Systematic Entomology.
While they were waiting for the paper to be published, another group of researchers also found the fly living in La Rioja Province, in northern Spain.
Dr Martín-Vega's team have also discovered an old museum specimen of the fly which they believe originated in Algeria.
"This specimen, together with the present captures in Spain, suggest that probably the species is also present in more countries of the Mediterranean Basin," he says.
The researchers want to ensure the fly is listed as a protected species, until more is known about where it lives.
The fixture is part of the South Yorkshire club's 150th anniversary celebrations, confirming their status as the world's oldest football club.
"I think he's quite honoured to be invited to mark 150 years of the game," Sheffield FC chairman Richard Tims told BBC Sport.
With Fifa president Sepp Blatter having attended the club's anniversary dinner last month, Tims believes Sheffield's contribution to shaping the game is recognised across the globe.
Formed on 24th October 1857 by Sheffield cricketers William Prest and Nathaniel Creswick, many ideas the club adopted are still used in football today.
Currently playing in the UniBond First Division South, Tims insists the club's emphasis remains not so much on climbing the leagues as providing an alternative to the modern game.
"If you like, this club is a conscience for the world of football and money.
Claudio Ranieri was the favourite for the City post but he is out of the running after taking over at Juventus.
Ramos, 52, has a contract with Seville until 2008 but he could leave this summer if his buy-out clause is paid.
City are nearing a possible takeover with ex-Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra set to gain control of the club.
Shinawatra is believed to have wanted Ranieri, who steered Parma to safety in Serie A after arriving as their manager with the club precariously placed late on in the season.
Ranieri admitted he knew of the prospect of assuming the City helm but that the length of time over takeover negotiations proved a stumbling block.
"There was a project to start from scratch at City," said the 55-year-old Italian.
"But they haven't yet been bought by a new owner and the weeks were passing by.
However, Ramos could still be tempted by the Eastlands job after spending almost six years in charge at Seville.
Carter will be named in the All Blacks line-up on Tuesday, but his place will not be confirmed until Thursday.
If unfit, Aaron Cruden, who took over after Carter scored 27 points in his side's 42-9 win in Dunedin, will play.
Full-back Israel Dagg (concussion) and lock Anthony Boric (cheekbone) are even more serious doubts than Carter in the wake of the All Blacks' winning farewell to Carisbrook in Dunedin.
Centre Conrad Smith could also be missing after suffering an eye injury against Wales while wing Joe Rokocoko has a minor knee problem.
Carter pulled up with a tight calf late on by which time he had scored two tries, kicked four conversions and three penalties.
Smith said the possibility of Wales being without their experienced number 10 Stephen Jones (thumb) would play no part in their decision to play Carter.
If Carter is ruled out, the spotlight will turn to last year's International Rugby Board's Under-20 player of the year, Cruden.
The 21-year-old Hurricanes pivot has a total of 32 minutes of international rugby under his belt after 25 minutes against a hapless Ireland and the last seven minutes against Wales where he was only denied a maiden Test try by a solid Ryan Jones tackle that bundled him into touch at the corner flag.
"We've brought Aaron in to develop him and he's shown he can just step into a Test match and play, which is promising," said Smith.
Carter's limited involvement at training will also ensure Cruden gets an extended run with the team in the build-up to the Waikato Stadium clash.
Smith was also coy on whether the likes of Zac Guildford, Piri Weepu, Adam Thomson and Aled de Malmanche would start after having little or no game time during the past two matches.
"The first thing is that we've got to win this Test match - I think that's key," Smith stressed.
He also made it clear that a repeat of the first half at Carisbrook would not be tolerated.
The All Blacks lost in the possession and territorial stakes and were put under pressure by some astute kicking from Stephen Jones and the Welsh rush defence.
Although they led 15-9 at the break, Henry's half-time pep talk left his team in no doubt that he expected better - and he got it.
Smith hinted that a lack of "edge" had contributed to the slow start - possibly the result of such a one-sided 66-28 win against the Irish the previous weekend.
"The week before we started really well against Ireland but then there were a lot of players who were unsure, who were anxious and who were going into the unknown and that tends to make you uncomfortable and raises your level of performance quite often," said Smith.
However he vowed to continue his fight against terrorism.
The guerrillas said the hostages died in crossfire, but the army says they were executed by rebels in a jungle camp, north-west of Medellin, capital of Antioquia province.
Some families of the victims criticised the government, saying they had opposed any rescue attempt and urged the authorities to pursue a negotiated solution to the hostage crisis.
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says the government will now be under increased pressure to exact revenge.
Three hostages survives Monday's failed rescue operation.
Among those who died were Antioquia Governor Guillermo Gaviria and former Defence Minister Gilberto Echeverri - who were captured during a peace march in Medellin more than a year ago.
They were being held by FARC guerrillas at the jungle camp with 11 soldiers and were part of a larger group of 80 hostages that the rebels wanted to trade for imprisoned comrades.
There are conflicting reports of what led up to the bloodshed, but the government has confirmed it had launched a rescue attempt.
Guerrillas said the hostages were killed when they became caught up in a gun battle as soldiers reached the camp, but the government says its troops did not open fire.
The family of Ingrid Betancourt, a presidential candidate being held captive by the FARC since last year, has called on President Uribe to refrain from launching fresh rescue attempts.
"Despite the pain, the president should think with a cool head and make the problem [of an exchange] a priority because the ends don't justify the means," said Yolanda Pulecio, the mother of Ms Betancourt.
But any chance of a peaceful humanitarian exchange of prisoners has now died with the hostages, our correspondent says.
President Uribe, whose father was killed by rebels and who is himself a former Antioquia governor, said his hardline policies would not change.
"In this moment of pain, Colombia cannot surrender," he said.
Mr Uribe was emotional as he described a phone call to Mr Echeverri's family.
Mr Uribe took office last year promising to crack down on the guerrilla groups that have waged an insurgency for nearly 40 years.
But armed rebel groups have continued their campaigns of violence.
The FARC is still holding hundreds of hostages, including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, senators, governors, mayors, police officers and members of the military.
Three Americans who were captured when their surveillance plane was shot down earlier this year are also being held by the rebels.
The actor told an audience at the Deauville film festival in France his entire career had stemmed from one decision.
As a young man in Wisconsin he had flipped a coin to decide whether to try his luck in Los Angeles or New York.
The audience watched a homage to Ford showing him as Han Solo in Star Wars, Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Dr Richard Kimble in the Fugitive.
As well as appearing in some of the most popular films ever, Ford starred in two of the 1980s biggest critical successes, Blade Runner and Witness.
Ford was accompanied to the event by current partner, former Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart.
The pair signed autographs for fans who lined up along the red carpet outside the cinema.
Flockhart, wearing a black strapless gown, told the crowd she was "really happy to be here" as they walked into the venue hand-in-hand.
The gangster film explores father-son relationships after Hanks' character's young son sees him killing another man.
And Hanks said he was leaving the film festival to be home in time for his children's first day of school.
Gwyneth Paltrow has used her appearance at Deauville to back British men.
After the UK's Now magazine quoted her complaining she had had only two dates while in London performing in a play, there was a mini furore.
Paltrow now says her remarks were misunderstood and she was merely observing a "sociological difference between English dating and American dating".
"I happen to adore British men and I adore Britain," she said.
France may have enjoyed good fortune to emerge triumphant in the Euro 2000 final - but they were worthy winners of a wonderful tournament.
Italy deserve a lot of sympathy because they looked winners in Rotterdam for so long, and then lost in the most dramatic circumstances.
Coach Dino Zoff will also feel the pain of defeat badly, because his team reserved their best performance of the championship for the final.
It was not the final many expected, but I felt both France and Italy were finally showing signs of tiredness at the end of a tournament that was a stern test both physically and mentally.
The final opened with real quality, but at the back of the minds of both teams was an understandable fear of losing.
Italy's defence was as good as ever, and France found themselves restricted to chances created by Thierry Henry.
The over-riding strength of Italy's defence, apart from the obvious quality of the players, is that it is so compact.
It ensured France were kept at relatively long range, and this is where the quality of Henry was such a force.
When faced with such a compact defence, the key you need to unlock it is pace and individuality.
He showed the way forward for France early in the second half when he almost created a goal for Zinedine Zidane.
But Italy had an outstanding performer of their own in Francesco Totti, and it was no surprise that he was instrumental in a goal that was beautifully created for Marco Delvecchio.
This presented Italy with the perfect scenario for their mental and tactical approach.
Italy with a 1-0 lead usually means victory, but as I said here before the final, this particular French team has a resilience and belief that survives the adversity of going a goal behind.
Alessandro Del Piero missed two chances to give Italy the win, but he cannot count great goalscoring among his many qualities, and France stayed in the game.
Roger Lemerre's substitutions were brave, audacious and effective, with Sylvain Wiltord and David Trezeguet making an obvious impact.
I knew Roger would introduce Trezeguet when France went a goal behind, and the effect he had at the end did not surprise me.
David is a player I have worked with, and I regard him as a natural finisher in the mould of my own striker at Liverpool, Robbie Fowler.
He proved that with the winning goal, and it was also a reward for the French coach.
France's heroes were also elsewhere, with Laurent Blanc a brilliant leader of their defence.
It is a great achievement for France to add Euro 2000 to the World Cup, and while I know people may expect me to say this as a Frenchman, I felt the competition got the right winners.
And observing from an impartial point of view, I felt the finish was the crowning moment of a championship that has shown so many wonderful things about football.
Mr Abbas said the ceasefire, which begins immediately, would lead to a "new era of peace and hope".
Mr Sharon vowed to cease military action against Palestinian targets after militant groups halted violence.
In response, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was the best chance for peace in years.
The meeting in the Egyptian resort of Sharm al-Sheikh was the highest-level discussion between the two sides since the Palestinian intifada (uprising) began more than four years ago.
Israeli officials said after the summit that Mr Sharon had invited Mr Abbas to his farm in southern Israel.
Speaking in Paris, the US secretary of state welcomed the truce.
"Success is not assured, but America is resolute," said Ms Rice.
The BBC's Heba Saleh in Sharm al-Sheikh says Mr Abbas so far seems to have secured an informal truce by Palestinian factions, but it is not clear whether they will accept the Israeli offer.
The Hamas militant group gave a lukewarm reaction to the summit, with its representative in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, saying the ceasefire declarations were "not binding" on its members.
Mr Hamdan told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Abbas had taken a "unilateral stand" that was "not the result of the outcome of an intra-Palestinian dialogue".
TV pictures showed Mr Abbas and Mr Sharon smiling as they shook hands across a table at the talks.
"We have agreed on halting all violent actions against Palestinians and Israelis, wherever they are," Mr Abbas said.
He said Israel had made some painful sacrifices for the Palestinians.
Mr Sharon also said the two sides had agreed on transferring "certain Palestinian areas" from Israeli to Palestinian control.
Under the arrangement, Israel will withdraw its troops from Jericho and four West Bank towns within three weeks, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Abu Libdeh said later.
The talks were also attended by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who hosted the summit, and Jordan's King Abdullah.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told reporters at the summit that Egypt and Jordan would soon be returning their ambassadors to Israel after a four-year absence.
Mr Sharon had refused to meet the previous Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, saying he was an obstacle to peace.
But since Arafat's death and the election of Mr Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority, the Israelis believe they have a partner they can do business with, says BBC World Affairs Correspondent Paul Welsh.

The UK house prices tracker is no longer being updated.
The new member - who has been already chosen - will be revealed in the "next 24 hours" says the band's website.
Mutya said her decision to quit the band was based on personal reasons, and was a very difficult one to make.
Mutya had her first baby, a little girl called Tahila, in March this year.
Muyta leaving means Keisha is now the only original member of the Sugababes still in the band.
The new Sugababe is going to be kept pretty busy in the coming months, with the band's own UK tour in March and April as well as supporting Take That on their mega tour too.
Sunday's Amlin Challenge Cup climax between Cardiff Blues and Toulon will be just the fourth involving a Welsh side in 15 seasons.
So, as might be expected, the prospect of becoming the first Welsh team to actually win an elusive European title saw a few nerves begin to jangle in Marseille on the eve of the match.
Fortunately for the travelling fans on Saturday there was plenty to keep the mind off the impending clash at the Stade Velodrome.
While Marseille, France's age-old port, is famous for its bouillabaisse and Savon de Marseille - soup and soap in other words - many minds were still focused on events back home despite the distractions on the south coast of France.
It was strange enough to have left Cardiff basking in temperatures a good few degrees higher than our destination on the Mediterranean coast.
But football - of all things - kept interrupting thoughts on a day when the anticipation of a major rugby game should have been in full flow.
The footballing half of Wales' capital city had decamped to Wembley for the day for the Championship play-off final.
Beat Blackpool and Cardiff City FC, the Blues' ground-sharing cousins at the new City Stadium, would be in the Premier League next season playing some of the biggest teams in club football.
A bar near the Stade Velodrome had been earmarked by club officials for Blues fans to watch the football and there were plenty who made the pilgrimage to keep an eye on Wembley events.
Elsewhere the 'beep' of received text messages filled the air as travellers were kept informed by those at home of Cardiff's 3-2 defeat.
Other Blues fans had foregone television - at least until the Heineken Cup final between Toulouse and Biarittz kicked off later on Saturday evening - and headed for the seafront of Marseille to wallow in the sun, soak up the atmosphere and mingle with the locals.
Even Wales coach Warren Gatland was spotted amongst the throng, here to cast his eye over the Blues players ahead of Tests against South Africa and New Zealand next month.
There was dismay among the Blues followers at news of Cardiff City's footballing loss, tempered with relief from at least one fan who had promised to jump in the Marseille dock to celebrate any Bluebirds triumph.
Opposing fans were also out in numbers and Phillipe Corlin is one of those Marseille residents who has adopted Toulon - half-an-hour east along the coast.
Citing his disenchantment at the off-field violence involved around Olympique Marseille - the city's football team - Phillipe has embraced rugby as his sport of choice.
He and many other Toulon followers also appear to have canonised Jonny Wilkinson, the England fly-half who joined Toulon this season from Newcastle and seems to have quickly earned a place in their hearts.
Last week's thrilling overtime loss to Clermont Auvergne in the French Top 14 semi-finals was, I was assured, mainly down to bad calls by the match officials and the Blues would have to produce something special to win on Sunday.
Maybe so, as Toulon had won 11 games straight before the Clermont loss in St Etienne.
But the Blues have a great record away from home this season, winning at English sides Newcastle in the quarter-finals and Wasps in the semis.
Whether they can upset the odds at a predicted sell-out 60,031 Stade Velodrome on Sunday is another matter.
But with the footballing side of Cardiff falling agonisingly short on Saturday, it is now up to the rugby half to claim the honour and the glory this weekend.
In a radio interview, Charles Stimson said he found it shocking that US law firms would represent inmates at the detention centre free of charge.
He also said the firms might suffer financially when corporate clients found they were involved in the cases.
Mr Stimson now says he did not intend to question the lawyers' integrity.
US lawyers' groups have written to President George W Bush calling for Mr Stimson, the deputy assistant secretary of defence for detainee affairs, to be sacked.
Around 400 detainees remain at the Guantanamo base five years after it was opened, despite calls by the UN and human rights groups to close it.
Some 75 of them are expected to face military tribunals in the coming months.
The others face indefinite detention without trial at the naval facility - which lies outside the jurisdiction of the US judicial system.
The Bush administration says the centre is a vital tool in its "war on terror".
In his original interview last week for Federal News Radio, Mr Stimson listed a number of major firms who he said should be boycotted for their work at Guantanamo.
He also suggested that some firms might have been receiving money from elsewhere to represent clients, and should explain themselves.
But Mr Stimson said on Wednesday that his comments did not reflect his core beliefs.
Neal Sonnett, the head of the American Judicature Society, a non-partisan group, said Mr Stimson's remarks had been "shameful and irresponsible".
He had made a "blatant attempt to intimidate lawyers and their firms who are rendering important public service in upholding the rule of law and our democratic ideals", he said.
After arriving in Costa Rica, deposed President Manuel Zelaya said he had been kidnapped by soldiers in a "coup".
Mr Zelaya, elected for a non-renewable four-year term in 2006, had wanted a vote to extend his time in office.
His arrest came just before the start of a referendum ruled illegal by the Supreme Court and opposed by Congress.
There had also been resistance within Mr Zelaya's own party to the plan for the vote.
Congress swiftly appointed its speaker Roberto Micheletti - a member of Mr Zelaya's Liberal Party, but an opponent of him - as acting head of state.
The day's drama began at dawn on Sunday when soldiers stormed the president's residence in the capital, Tegucigalpa, an hour before polls were to open.
Mr Zelaya was taken to an airbase outside the city and rumours swirled over his whereabouts.
The BBC's Stephen Gibbs, in the region, says armoured vehicles were on the streets and troops fired tear gas to disperse the president's supporters outside his home.
Several hours later Mr Zelaya turned up in Costa Rica and said troops had "kidnapped" him in his pyjamas.
He insisted he was still the rightful president and urged Hondurans to resist those who had removed him.
"This was a plot by a very voracious elite, an elite which wants only to keep this country isolated, in an extreme level of poverty," he said.
Later the Honduran Supreme Court said it had ordered the removal of the president, who had been due to leave office next January.
• At an emergency meeting in Washington, the Organization of American States said it was a "coup"
• Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, blamed "the Yankee empire", and threatened military action should the Venezuelan ambassador to Honduras be attacked; President Evo Morales of Bolivia described Mr Zelaya's removal as "an assault on democracy"
• The White House denied any involvement; President Barack Obama urged Honduras to "respect the rule of law" and a State Department official said America recognised Mr Zelaya as the duly elected president
• The European Union called for "a swift return to constitutional normality" in Honduras
The military's dramatic move came after President Zelaya sacked the chief of the army, Gen Romeo Vasquez, on Wednesday for refusing to help him organise the referendum.
A day later, the Honduran Congress approved plans to investigate whether the president should be declared unfit to rule.
In an interview with Spain's El Pais newspaper published on Sunday, Mr Zelaya said a plot to topple him had been thwarted after the US refused to back it.
The Central American country - an impoverished coffee and banana-exporting nation of more than 7 million people - has experienced military coups in the past.
Soldiers overthrew elected presidents in 1963 and again in 1975; the military did not turn the government over to civilians until 1981.
Cockfighter, made in 1974, features real fights between cockerels which breach animal cruelty laws.
The US film about a mute cocktrainer was never granted a UK certificate as it was impossible to make a clean cut.
A law was introduced in 1937 in response to complaints about horses being made to fall in Western films.
Ginnie Atkinson, managing director of the film festival, said they "can't fight" the law and they could not risk prosecution by showing the film.
The film, which was directed by Monte Hellman, won praise for its central performance by Warren Oates - but critics described the graphic scenes of cockfighting as "nauseating".
These are the words of President Vladimir Putin, who went on to say that thanks to his predecessor "a new democratic Russia was born, a free state open to the world".
Russian conservatives who revere Mr Putin and disdain the Yeltsin legacy must also be surprised.
And did Mr Yeltsin himself, perhaps inadvertently, make this turn-around inevitable not only by bringing the former KGB secret police, with their particular view of the world, into the heart of the government, but also by allowing the all-permeating system of corruption to take root?
Nearly single-handedly, on the strength of his personal charisma and popularity he took on the formidable police state, inspiring other Russian liberals to unite around him and, somehow, incredibly, triumphed over the KGB, the Soviet Army and the huge Communist Party apparatus.
There was no depth to this popularity, though.
It was this same personal popularity that also allowed radical economic reforms to be introduced.
The hurried privatization that followed could only knock his ratings further.
To save the country from the return of the dreaded Communists, Yeltsin turned to oligarchs and cynical spin-doctors (called in Russia "political technologists') who ruthlessly and efficiently manipulated voters via TV to win for him the 1996 elections.
But it was easier to play on fears of a return to totalitarianism than to win back Russians' hearts and minds.
By that time, the public was already hankering for the "good old days".
Nostalgia for everything associated with Soviet times was suddenly all the rage and the prevailing wisdom insisted on the incompatibility between the Russian mentality and Western models of civil society.
The overwhelming majority of the Russians these days agree with Putin's, not Yeltsin's view of their country's place in the world.
The current president is even more popular than his predecessor ever was and polls indicate that the public would like him to govern indefinitely.
There are two opposite conclusions that can be drawn from all of this.
First, that Russia's fling with Western-style freedoms and democracy was a freak short accident and the country is now going back to its normal traditional ways.
If this is true, all Yeltsin's struggles and heroism would have been totally wasted.
The second view is that Boris Yeltsin continued what Mikhail Gorbachev had started before him - that they, in fact, worked for the same goal even if they both would hate to admit it - and that in the long run they have succeeded.
If this is the case then it would mean - the current backlash notwithstanding - that the true significance of Yeltsin's achievement will be finally recognised by future generations.

I met Rachel North at Russell Square tube.
She was in the carriage with the suicide bomber who killed himself and 26 others on a rush-hour tube on 7 July 2004.
Within minutes of the explosion, she and a few others were trying to calm everyone, asking those who were not injured to stand up and help the injured out, using coats for stretchers.
There were two drivers on the train; both, she told me, were fantastic.
One administered first aid, even though there was not any kit on the train and the other used his torch to lead them quarter of a mile down the tracks, to safety.
It is an iconic image; people walking along the tracks and coming out at Russell Square.
It was only in the months after that Rachel became angry.
She found out that the radio systems, underground, were so archaic they did not communicate with the other emergency services, nor could they send out any more than one message at a time.
It was later she questioned why it took so long for medical staff to get down to those dead or injured and why the local hospital, two minutes away, was not used until 50 minutes after the bomb went off.
She also queried why it was, that the only person to ask her and other survivors what had actually happened, was 10 months later when the London Assembly looked at operational flaws.
Also, at Russell Square that morning, was Crispin Black.
He is a former security analyst for the government and wrote a book "7/7 What went Wrong?"
He told me that if we really are to improve on the response to large-scale disasters, such as this, or even a fire (like the Kings Cross fire in 1987) the best course of action would be to have what the army calls 'a unity of command'.
One man in charge - he calls the shots and has a direct line to the Prime Minister.
But this suggestion is not in the Home Office report that has been published this week.
It, like the London Assembly's, refers to what could be improved and points specifically to better communications (both below and above ground), better crisis co-ordination and improved services for survivors or those bereaved.
It also lists what it is doing to make things better.
The question is, do reports like this, end up being filed away somewhere and are lessons really learnt?
Use the reply form below let Politics Show London know what you think.
The LDNPA has a vision...
"Working together for a prosperous economy, vibrant communities and world class visitor experiences - and all sustaining the spectacular landscape".
But many people living and working around The Lakes argue that the LDNPA, the planning authority for The Lakes, is stifling economic growth, ignoring the communities and could even be putting off the visitors!
The Park Authority predicts it will spend �176 for every person who lives in the park - or 62p per visitor.
Last year it had to take some severe measures to balance the books after it predicted a �1m budget shortfall.
The LDNPA decided, in a meeting behind closed doors, to shut down six of its nine tourist information offices.
This infuriated local hoteliers and guest-house owners.
The LDNPA is governed by the Park's Authority Board and its 26 members, none of whom, are directly elected - but some are indirectly elected.
Fourteen of those appointed, are county or district councillors and the other 12 are appointed by the Secretary of State.
That expertise comes from years of experience - some have been on the board for 12 or 15 years - one has even been there for nearer 30 years.
He also believes the Park Authority is not flexible enough and that it needs to consider individual circumstances instead of a blanket application of the law.
It is this planning role of the LDNPA that is stirring up the most passion among local folk.
Mark Weir owns the Honister Slate Mine in Borrowdale, employing 40 people in a valley where there is little alternative to the tourism industry.
He has had "run-ins" with the LDNPA going back 10 years.
Like many locals he was outraged when his nearest Tourist Information Office was closed - so much so, that he offered to buy it.
He has recently succeeded in renting the former tourist office building and is in the process of re-opening it himself.
Another tourist information office is being run by a co-op of locals.
Mark Weir also fell foul of the planning rules.
He wanted to turn the shell of a derelict farmhouse on his property into a living working farmhouse.
His application was turned down.
Many more people had issues with the authority decisions but were unwilling to talk on the record for fear of getting on the wrong side of the authority.
Many people in The Lakes argue that the LDNPA is not trying to preserve this beautiful area but is actually trying to turn back time and turn it into a museum of days gone by - ignoring the fact that life has to continue.
There is no doubt the LDNPA has a difficult job - preserving a national treasure and at the same time allowing the local people to live work and play like people anywhere else in the country.
Our live guests on Sunday are Tim Farron MP, Westmorland and Bob Cartwright Director of LDNPA.
Toilets - we all need them but trying to find a public one can be a difficult task.
Across the country local councils have been closing their public conveniences left, right and centre because of financial constraints.
In Preston City centre only two remain and the council are currently looking at what they can do to improve toilet provision.
BBC Radio Lancashire's Alison Butterworth has been to Preston in search of those elusive loos.
This weekend is "National Specials Weekend" - three days celebrating the work of the volunteers who work alongside regular police officers dealing with local problems of crime and disorder.
This year also marks the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Specials back in 1831.
The Special Constables Act of 1831 granted them the same "powers, authorities, advantages and immunities" as full-time constables.
This is still true today as Special Constables have the same powers as regular police officers.
The main difference in 1831 was that no-one could refuse to serve as a Special.
In fact, the Act allowed for a �5 fine if they did! Today's Specials give their time on a voluntary basis.
Set up to keep the peace in their local areas the Specials went on to perform a whole range of jobs over the years.
This included taking on a prominent role in historic events such as the general strike of 1936 and the Second World War.
Perhaps their strangest function was preventing German infiltrators from interfering with the nation's water supply in World War One.
Today, their main duties are uniform patrols, crime prevention work and policing local events.
The Politics Show North West has spent the day on the beat with two special constables from the Cheshire Police Force, who both have full time jobs.
Within three years, shipbuilding on the Upper Clyde had received around �101 million of public grants and credits, with �20 million going to the UCS.
We did consider a second strike but I reckon it was far too negative that, and wehad an enormous order book, plenty of work and the logical thing was, why don't we work-in, refuse to accept redundancy and work.
You're talking about eight thousand workers, overwhelmingly family men with kids.
This was an image that I think the chief constables told the government that they couldn't guarantee that their members, that is the policemen, would carry that out, because it would alienate the whole community.
We had agreements we had reached about the interchangeability of certain work grades and all the rest of it that were quite significantly ahead of anything else in British shipbuilding, and so we had these things going.
The significant difference was that the Upper Clyde was publicly owned, and the Lower Clyde was privately owned.
One of the old communist shop stewards from Dumbarton, he says, "it cannae be Lenin, he's dead".
I think Jack Bruce came out of retirement to give a concert for us in London and Eric Clapton.
So stars together, put on a show for us in Glasgow, it was like a royal command performance, all coming and queuing.
But that's less important than the weekly contributions and children having little jumble sales at street corners and churches.
Believe it or not we actually got regular contributions from a Conservative party constituency association that thought we were right and the government was wrong and the money poured in, and then from abroad, all over Europe.
The subject of the story - the Greeks' 10-year siege of Troy and the wooden horse they used to bring it to an end - may have been a myth, but its geography was not.
When they compared their findings with his descriptions of the Trojan plain, they found a match.
Speaking to BBC World Service programme Science In Action, John Luce from Trinity College Dublin, explained the study's significance.
"It has to be taken seriously that the Homeric picture of the fighting at Troy is in close accord with the geological findings," he said.
Then in the 1870s, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered what were believed to be the remains of an ancient city well inland from the coast of what is now Turkey.
Scientists now believe that, over the centuries, this inlet became silted up with the deposits from rivers, pushing the coastline back to its present-day position.
Since 1977, Dr Luce has been involved with an international group of researchers who have taken part in a systematic drilling programme in an attempt to document the landscape changes.
Dr John Kraft, from the University of Delaware in the US, carried out the geological investigations, together with Turkish colleagues, drilling out samples of sediment from well below the surface.
Further drilling south on the plain revealed what the researchers believe to have been a major marine area, leading them to conclude that the sea had been pushed back to its present location by a build up of silt deposits in the delta.
"It was right in front of Troy that we were drilling a hole and seashells came out," Dr Kraft enthused.
Back in Dublin, Dr Luce compared Schliemann's original claims with the researchers' findings and tested Homer's phrases in the Iliad.
Reinterpreting the written material led Dr Luce to "swing the axis of fighting round to a different viewpoint west of Troy".
In so doing, Dr Luce and colleagues have shown that Schliemann's location for Troy does agree with Homer's accounts of the battle.
This research is described in the journal Geology.
Sir Paul is marrying former model Heather Mills at Castle Leslie, in the village of Glaslough in County Monaghan on Tuesday afternoon.
In Liverpool, where there is a thriving Beatle's nostalgia industry, there were messages of support for the couple.
That sentiment was echoed elsewhere.
BBC Merseyside presenter and Beatles expert Spencer Leigh said the city still loved The Beatles.
"It will be interesting to see what this does to McCartney's music," he said.
Mark Byrne, director of The Beatles Story museum at Liverpool's Albert Docks said it was a tragedy when Sir Paul's first wife, Linda died.
"He will never forget Linda and Heather Mills will never forget Linda - the media will always remind her of Linda.
"But Paul has come to another stage in his life and has met someone and fallen in love and wants to be with this woman for the rest of his life.
"There were no negative comments from anyone.
Liverpool attracts 600,000 visitors a year - spending �20m - who come to see the city where the world-famous group originated.
The city boasts the Cavern Club, where the Beatles performed in the early 1960s, as well as museums and exhibitions outlining the story of the group.
And an exhibition of Sir Paul's pictures, The Art Of Paul McCartney, will run at the Walker Art Gallery until 4 August.
The area was brought to a standstill as five restaurants were raided during the busy lunchtime period on Thursday.
Shocked passers-by stopped and stared as more than 100 arrest-trained immigration staff and police stormed the Soho premises.
The exact number of people detained will be confirmed by the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) later.
Chinese, Malaysian and Singaporean nationals were arrested and documents relating to illegal employment seized.
Two Malaysian nationals were already set to fly back to their home country following the operation.
Malcolm Leow, 23, an accountant who came to London from China two months ago, witnessed the raids.
Tony Smith, the BIA's regional director for the South East said about 60 raids on illegal workers were taking place in London each week.
"The BIA is very anxious to crack down on those who facilitate the entry of illegal workers for financial gain and then exploit them with poor wages and working conditions," he said.
"And we're targeting the employers, not just the workers.
Earlier this year the Home Office announced an action plan to target rogue employers.
New unlimited fines for those who employ illegal workers will be placed before Parliament for approval later this month.
The raids were part of a wider strategy by the BIA to clamp down on illegal workers - some of whom pay thousands of pounds to be trafficked to Britain by gangs who then exploit them.
Chinese Triad and Snakehead gangs are known to be major players in this underworld labour trade.
The number of Chinese nationals entering the UK each year illegally has been estimated at 50,000 - but a Home Office spokesman said there was no official figure.
Coalition troops were ready to help with specific tasks, Mr Straw said, and might become involved in humanitarian role, such as securing airfields and transport routes.
But any decision on the deployment of a large scale stabilisation force - including up to 6,000 British troops currently on standby - would now have to wait until next week's talks between the various Afghan factions in Bonn.
"Exactly what their needs are in terms of longer-term peacekeeping and stabilisation from outside remains to be seen," Mr Straw said.
The foreign secretary is in Pakistan on the second leg of a mission to secure support for the establishment of a broad-based, multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan.
Following that meeting, Dr Kharrazi told journalists he believed the Afghans would prefer foreign troops to stay off their soil.
"This is a very sensitive issue to Afghans," he said.
However, the United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, said he believed there might be a role for an international security force within Afghanistan.
"Peacekeepers no, not at this point, we don't have a peace to keep.
"But some kind of security force under a United Nations mandate might well be the right approach," he said.
Mr Vendrell said he believed such a force would be acceptable to most Afghans.
He also said it would be unwise to expect too much from Monday's meeting in Bonn.
Earlier, Mr Straw said a fledgling civil administration in Afghanistan could be in place within a week.
Mr Straw is due to have discussions with Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf and Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar on Friday.
Every minute, two people are killed in conflicts around the world.
Often very little is known about the people who are fighting and dying.
The BBC programme One Day of War follows individual fighters in 16 of these wars, over the same 24 hour period.
Then read accounts of the conflicts from each of the 16 locations.
That kind of thing keeps cropping up and I think the thing is that children are reading them 12 times, or whatever it might be, and they really are starting to know the way my mind works.
And having said all along that if you are writing about evil I believe that you should give children - you should have enough respect for them to show what that means, not to dress up as a pantomime villain and say - lots of smoke and thunder, I think, and it's not frightening at all really.
I remember vividly the afternoon, my daughter fell asleep I ran into the caf� on a beautifully sunny day, I sat down and I wrote that chapter from beginning to end and I think I changed two words and that's very unusual for me.
There's a chapter in book four I rewrote 13 times and at one point I thought the book will never happen if I keep rewriting chapter whatever it was.
England's men's 4x400m relay team of Conrad Williams, Nick Leavey, Rick Yates and Rob Tobin take bronze in the final, behind Australia and Kenya.
Millar, who has been sacked by his Cofidis team, faces a minimum two-year ban after he confessed to taking the stamina-boosting drug EPO.
"I want to show how I got round the system and I'm willing to work with the International Cycling Union and British Cycling Federation," he said.
The vital evidence that led to Millar's downfall was the discovery by police of a pair of syringes which he used to inject himself before the world championship in October 2003.
He said the experience of winning on drugs had "scarred" him and he had kept them to remind himself of how far he had compromised his principles.
This is her fourth outing as an Oscar presenter - she most recently presented the best original song award at the 71st Oscars.
Actor and comic Steve Martin will be Master of Ceremonies on the night.
Amongst the films most fancied for an Oscar nomination are Gladiator, Ridley Scott's film about a Roman general who falls from favour and seeks revenge as a gladiator.
Gladiator has already won a best film award at the Golden Globes and has 14 Bafta nominations.
Also in the running are Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe's fictionalised story about his experiences as a teenage rock journalist in the 1970s, which won a Golden Globe for best comedy film.
Also tipped is Ang Lee's critically acclaimed Chinese-language film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which won the Golden Globe for best foreign language film and has 14 Bafta nominations.
Bloodied stakes rise violently from the ground in the combat arena, while corpses swing from gibbets in the wind, and a ragged crowd on the battlements above bays for blood.
The woman's speed and agility enable her to dodge the gladiator's violent spear thrusts, sparks flying as the point of the weapon strikes the stony castle ground.
She launches a flying kick, connecting hard with the gladiator's head, but he spins round and smashes her with his shield.
A cry of "cut" halts the action, and the combatants are suddenly surrounded by a frenzy of activity by dozens of film crew members.
British writer-director Neil Marshall is shooting his ambitious follow-up to hit horror films Dog Soldiers and The Descent.
"It first came about with this idea that I had for these futuristic soldiers encountering a knight in armour on a horse in the woods somewhere," says Marshall.
"I thought that would make a great image for a movie, but under what context could I possibly do that?"
The story, that has taken five years to reach the filming stage, sees Hadrian's Wall rebuilt and Scotland quarantined to contain a deadly virus.
Thirty years into the future the Reaper virus resurfaces in England, leading an elite group of police officers, headed by actress Rhona Mitra, to be sent to Scotland in search of a cure.
They are soon fighting for their lives against the land's two tribes of survivors - car gangs of cannibalistic punks known as "marauders", and a group, led by Malcolm McDowell's Kane, who have reverted to a medieval lifestyle.
The film also stars Bob Hoskins, Adrian Lester and Sean Pertwee.
It is inside the 15th Century-built Blackness Castle, a popular tourist attraction about 18 miles west of Edinburgh, that Mitra is dodging carefully-choreographed spear thrusts.
Before each shot, Marshall and the film's stunt co-ordinators talk the actors through slow-motion rehearsals of the forthcoming action scenes.
It will take more than two days to film a sequence that will last not much more than two minutes on screen.
"The heroes are captured and put in the castle dungeon, and one of them has to face a gladiatorial trial in the arena," says Marshall.
Marshall's previous works have earned him inclusion in the so-called 'Splat Pack' of film-makers, along with contemporaries such as Hostel director Eli Roth.
And while Marshall stresses that Doomsday is not a horror film, he makes clear that he is not easing up on the gore.
"I can't resist splashing the blood around," he says.
He also created the make-up for the victims of the Reaper virus.
The fruits of his labour lie in a variety of hideous figures with bloodied, disintegrating flesh, for which Hyett did considerable research into real illnesses including sexually-transmitted infections.
"Now you can find everything on the internet - infections, diseases that people can get," he says.
With a $30m (�15m) budget - about 10 times the amount allocated to his previous projects - Marshall admits he was initially daunted by the prospect of directing scenes with up to 700 extras.
"I've only ever worked with 20 before," he says.
"And having so many cameras to work with - on the bigger set-ups we've had 10 cameras.
"We're trying to do a $100m movie for $30m, instead of trying to do a $30m movie for $3m.
At which point, as if to highlight his point, Marshall is called back to the more urgent business of directing Mitra's battle to avoid a grisly end.
He described Europe and the United States as the "two pillars of stability" left in a changing world and said the task now was to match America's economic growth.
But the EU leaders assembled in Cardiff admitted Europe had become remote from the people.
The 15 leaders of member states agreed to hold a specialsummit in Vienna in the autumn to attempt to make their decisions relevant.
Mr Blair could still be in for a rough ride during the summit marking the end of the UK's presidency.
A row over German funding has blown up with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl asking for a lower EU subsidy.
But Mr Blair said a forthcoming rearrangement of all EU finances meant Germany's move would get little support.
European Commission President Jacques Santer appeared to suggest thatBritain's rebate could be thrown into the melting pot if the funding debate was opened up.
Tory leader William Hague has attacked the UK's six-month presidency of the EU.
He said the period had "certainly has not lived up to its expectations".
But Mr Blair said the row over the presidency of the ECB was a disagreement between France and Holland,which was "nothing whatever" to do with Britain.
There had been "huge progress" in completing the single market and reform ofthe Common Agricultural Policy and he rejected a suggestion that his government was prevaricating over the issue of whether Britain would join the single currency.

Anglian Water scientists first discovered the cryptosporidium at 0100 BST during a routine test of Pitsford Water Treatment Works.
The works serves Northampton, Daventry and nearby villages.
Sara Rowland, of Anglian Water, said the firm routinely tests more than 1,000 samples a day.
Scientists at Anglian Water's laboratories in Huntingdon found the sample from Pitsford was "cloudy" and further tests revealed cryptosporidium.
Ms Rowland said extra staff were being brought in to the laboratories to carry out tests to determine if the bug is in the water supplies and what the source of the bug is.
She said Anglian Water staff were now getting samples from Pitsford and from sample mains in the area.
They are also taking random samples from taps in the Northampton/Daventry area.
Ms Rowland said it was still early days with the investigation and restrictions could continue for two weeks or even longer.
She said if it is found to be in the water system, it will then be flushed out of the system.
She said as long as water is boiled, it is safe to drink.
Anglian Water is providing bottled water for schools and hospitals.
A spokeswoman for the Health and Protection Agency said at present there were no cases of cryptosporidium infection.
She said cryptosporidium is quite a common bug which can be be caught from faeces, for example when changing nappies, from infected pets or by swimming in, or drinking contaminated water.
The strongest storms for a decade in northern Spain and south-west France have brought chaos to the area.
The storms are thought to have claimed five lives in Spain, as winds of up to 107mph (172kmph) struck the Atlantic coast and spread inland.
More than one million homes in France are without electricity, and rail and air services have been suspended in many areas.
Hundreds of technicians have been sent out to to try and restore power to homes in the area, but thousands of fallen trees have blocked roads, hampering their efforts.
Weather forecasters had predicted the storms but they ended up hitting a wider area than was thought.
People living in affected areas in both countries have been warned to stay indoors for their own safety.
Simon Mensing took advantage of a great Jason Scotland cross to put Saints ahead early in the first half.
County struck back through Don Cowie's close-range strike in the 62nd minute.
But McManus's superb strike in the final seconds proved decisive for Saints to keep them in the Division One promotion race.
Drew Mitchell's try gave the Wallabies an early lead, but the Melbourne crowd were rocked as New Zealand ran over four times to lead 32-14 at half-time.
Dan Carter, Mils Muliaina, Richie McCaw and Cory Jane did the damage and when Mitchell was sent off in the second half, Australia's hopes lay in tatters.
Joe Rokocoko was among the second-half scorers as the All Blacks cruised home.
The win is New Zealand's record eighth in a row against Australia and means they are certain to retain the Bledisloe Cup ahead of the two teams' next Tri-Nations meeting in Christchurch on Saturday 7 August.
All Blacks coach Graham Henry was thrilled not only by the size of their victory, but also the quality they showed in front of the 51,409 crowd.
Both teams had taken a 100% Tri-Nations record into the game after the All Blacks had beaten South Africa twice and Australia saw off the Springboks last weekend, and it was a fast and furious start at Docklands Stadium.
Mitchell charged down Carter's kick and ran over to give Australia an eighth-minute lead, but within five minutes the visitors surged into the lead.
Carter made almost instant amends for his mistake as he charged down Berrick Barnes's kick to score and then Muliaina crossed the line after a brilliant chipped kick from the right touchline from Jane.
Australia's display was error-strewn throughout and they fell further behind when McCaw took advantage of a loose ball to run in before Jane nipped in for a try after a line-out 10m out, Carter firing over both conversions.
Australia needed to start the second half well to have any chance of getting back into it, but when Mitchell was shown a second yellow card for holding on to the ball, his side's slim hopes all-but evaporated.
Muliaina finished off a spell of prolonged pressure to add his second try shortly after.
Australia refused to lie down and after Adam Ashley-Cooper got the Wallabies back on the scoreboard, only for Rokocoko to reach for the line at the other end.
It was a 46th All Blacks try on his 64th Test appearance on the day he became New Zealand's most-capped winger.
The Aussies drew closer once more when Rocky Elsom barged through to score 10 minutes from time, but New Zealand wrapped up the scoring when they switched quickly from left to right and Corey Flynn finished the move off.
Carter missed the conversion to deny New Zealand a record score against Australia, but they are now strong favourites to win their 10th Tri-Nations tournament.
Zimbabwe secured the win that keeps their Super Six hopes alive but were not entirely convincing against Holland, the whipping boys of Group A.
A score in excess of 300 and a 99-run verdict is a substantial win on paper.
But great heroics late on from Andy Blignaut and Heath Streak were required to push Zimbabwe past 300 after only Andy Flower impressed from the top-order with 71.
And an attack which lacked penetration allowed the Dutch to post their biggest score of the World Cup, beating the 156 they hit against Pakistan.
The match was notable for the absence of Henry Olonga, who was controversially looked over in favour of injury doubt Douglas Hondo.
Holland's decision to put Zimbabwe in to looked a wise one with the ball moving through the air early on.
Skipper Roland Lefebvre was rewarded for an impressive opening spell when Craig Wishart was well-caught by wicket-keeper Jeroen Smits for 21.
Flower was dropped by Daan van Bunge in the 13th over, but the heartbreak of that missed chance was soon compensated with the first of two Jan Kloppenburg strikes.
Mark Vermeulen, in the side for injured Grant Flower, was unconvincing in reaching 27 when he played onto his stumps.
Zimbabwe, three down after Guy Whittall fell to a blinding catch by Bas Zuiderent in the deep, were looking increasingly uncertain when Flower fell to reduce them to 165 for four.
But Blignaut, who last Tuesday hit Australia for a half-century, struck a blazing 58 off 38 balls before falling in the 45th over.
Streak carried on the good work, hitting six fours and a six and surviving until the last ball.
Holland began their mountainous run-chase with a plan to go after Zimbabwe, and fortune favoured their brave approach.
Edgar Schiferli, who also opened the bowling, and Jan Kloppenburg swung for their lives and reaped the rewards.
Neither found the middle of their bats, but numerous top-edges over a stacked slip cordon contributed to a run-rate of five an over.
But both batsmen soon ran out of lives in the space of eight runs as Holland were reduced to 48 for two.
Zimbabwe looked in total control when Zuiderent and Tim de Leede fell in quick succession, but van Bunge and Lucas van Troost had other ideas.
Their 42-run stand in six whirlwind overs never threatened to get Holland out of the mire but succeeded in making Zimbabwe look pedestrian for a time.
And there was more to come as Lefebvre helped himself to 30 off 23 balls, playing as if victory was an achievable aim.
But it was never to be and four points was Zimbabwe's reward.
They head into Tuesday's match against Pakistan knowing a win is an absolute necessity if they are to progress to the next stage.
Holland may soon be on their way home, but not before facing Namibia on Monday in a match they will have genuine hopes of winning.
Since privatisation, Railtrack has been the focus for passenger complaints about overcrowding, delays, expense and most serious of all, their fears about safety.
Three years into the job, even the combative and direct Corbett admitted the job was more difficult than he had expected.
Since then, the media has been full of Mr Corbett's and Railtrack's apologies for the situation - some of them in paid advertisements addressing travellers.
But apologies and excuses can only go so far and the time now appears to have come for the one-time management consultant to step down.
He and the company he ran may have rightly attracted media and public criticism but some City analysts hold the view that he has made a better job of running Railtrack than was previously done.
Mr Corbett argued that privatisation of the industry left Railtrack in a tricky position.
While many will consider he should have resigned earlier, his actions appear to show that he did take the social responsibility of his job seriously.
Last year, Mr Corbett waived his bonus "in light of the events of the year and his position in the industry".
Prior to joining Railtrack, he had been finance director at Grand Metropolitan.
He held senior positions at Dixons between 1982 and 1987 before becoming group finance director at Redlands, the building materials company.
Mr Corbett, 48, studied history at Cambridge and attended London and Harvard business schools, before joining Boston Consulting Group, the international management consulting firm, where he stayed until 1982.
He is married with four children.
Back on 6 January I wrote in this diary about one of the most affecting pieces of video I had seen coming out of Gaza.
I was frustrated that I did not even know the names of the man and his son.
Despite Israel's decision to ban foreign journalists from crossing into Gaza, I think the BBC did some very good journalism during the 22 days of war, not least because we have two great Palestinian producers in Gaza, Hamada Abu Qammar and Rushdi Abu Alouf.
But I wanted to know more about the man, much more.
We have been trying to put together his story.
The Israelis, who are fond of saying that they have the most ethical army in the world, say that they are investigating too.
It is clear that in Zaytoun civilians were not treated with respect, and that many of them - as many as 29 - died in circumstances which should worry the Israeli army very much.
And I am glad that I can finally put a name to a face.
Acting leader Harriet Harman and former minister Chris Bryant on the election of a new Labour leader, which will see the winner announced at its September conference.
Chris Bryant would have backed a quicker contest - and gives his backing for David Miliband, one of only two declared candidates so far.
The transfer of hazardous waste is restricted by a 1989 treaty known as the Basel Convention, but the United States has not ratified it.
"I've seen a lot of dirty operations in Third World countries, but what was shocking was seeing all this post-consumer waste," said one of the report's authors, Jim Puckett of the Seattle-based Basel Action Network.
By publishing their report, the campaigners hope it will increase the pressure on American companies and politicians to do more to recycle computer waste.
The report says electronic waste is the most rapidly growing waste problem in the world, with toxic ingredients such as the lead, mercury or cadmium being released into the environment.
The report says that workers, with little or no protection against hazardous materials, burned plastics and circuit boards or poured acid on electronic parts to extract silver and gold.
The effect was to fill the air with carcinogenic smoke and pollute the water, said the report.
The campaigners said preliminary investigations in both Pakistan and India had revealed that these countries were also receiving and processing waste electronics from the West.
The growing amount of computer waste is becoming an increasing problem, with millions of devices becoming obsolete each year as the technology industry produces faster, better and less expensive equipment.
While there are recycling programmes in the US, campaigners say much of the waste electronics finds it way to the developing world.
The report suggested that as much as 80% of the America's electronic waste collected to be recycled is shipped out of the country.
"Everybody knows this is going on, but they are just embarrassed and don't really know what to do about it," said Ted Smith, head of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, which also helped prepare the new report.
The university, most of whose students gain three grade As or better, claims the current system makes it hard to differentiate between highly able applicants.
In its draft response to a government taskforce report on university admissions, Cambridge backs the idea of expanding Advanced Extension Awards - set at a higher level - to help achieve this.
It also demands more assessment of skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, essay-writing and extended argument.
An interim report by the government's university access taskforce, published in April, said all applicants should be able to show their "potential", as well as academic achievement.
The taskforce, chaired by Brunel University vice-chancellor Steven Schwartz, concluded that "equal examination grades [at A-level] do not necessarily represent equal potential", where leading universities were concerned.
It said some extra qualities, such as enthusiasm and motivation, were important to selection.
Cambridge's response says candidates must be "considered as individuals, judged on their own merits, without partiality and bias".
It sometimes accepted students with "lower attainment levels" than three A grades at A-level, to allow for "educational disadvantage or disruption".
But qualities other than academic achievement were hard to quantify, so there was a danger that publishing data on these could bring more "unrealistic applications".
The pressure of numbers of candidates for places at leading universities is high, the Cambridge response adds.
The Lib Dem leader accused ministers of "hiding behind weasel-worded legal excuses" and demanded that Gordon Brown and Alan Johnson intervene in the case.
Mr McKinnon, 43, has been denied leave to appeal to the new UK Supreme Court against his extradition to the US.
The Home Office has refused to comment while the legal case continues.
Mr McKinnon has admitted hacking into 97 US government computers, including those of Nasa and the Pentagon.
He insists he was looking for evidence of UFOs but US authorities want to try him under anti-terrorism laws, which carry a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison.
Following the failure of Mr McKinnon's appeal on Friday, Mr Clegg told the BBC his case demonstrated "precisely why we, the Lib Dems, were so staunchly opposed to this treaty right from the beginning".
"The Home Office and the government are hiding behind weasel-worded legal excuses.
Mr McKinnon has Asperger's Syndrome and his lawyers say extradition could have "disastrous consequences" for his health.
A Conservative-led debate in the House of Commons in July failed to force a review of the laws.
During the debate the home secretary said the act had simplified extradition rules while still protecting suspects' rights.
At the time Mr Johnson denied claims the law was one-sided, saying the burden of evidence required to secure someone's extradition on either side was "essentially" the same.
Jason Ness was a passenger in a Peugot 306 which overturned in a field off the B920 Scotlandwell to Ballingry road at about 2240 BST on Saturday.
The 21-year-old driver suffered minor injuries in the accident.
Jason's family said he was a "model son" who would "always be adored by us all".
His parents, Willie and Rosie, said Jason loved sport and keeping fit, and had wanted to join the Royal Marines after serving his apprenticeship as a bricklayer.
Mr and Mrs Ness said Celtic fan Jason had joined the Army cadets at the age of 12, where he met his girlfriend Lorna.
"Whether it was getting ready for a night out or ironing his clothes, everything was done to military precision.
Pete Williams and Mike Sheen, both from Wrexham, came across a hoard of bronze and gold dating back to between 1,000 and 800 BC - and are now entitled to a share of its value.
At the inquest at the North East Wales Coroner's Court in Flint on Friday, the find of gold bracelet fragments, a bronze axe and dagger was declared as treasure.
According to the law, this means the two men will be "fully compensated for the full monetary value" of the hoard, which will now be independently assessed.
It also enables the National Museum of Wales to have first refusal on acquiring the items.
Adam Gwilt, a curator at the museum in Cardiff, said the discovery was very important to archaeologists.
"It helps us to find out about the society and to piece together an account of the period," he said.
The two men from the Wrexham Metal Detectorists Club came across the items at a rally on 16 January near Rossett, in Wrexham.
The late Bronze Age find comprises four gold bracelet fragments, which were placed inside the socket of a slender bronze axe and accompanied by a bronze dagger.
The dagger is the first of its kind to be discovered in Wales, whilst similar gold bracelets are known from two hoards discovered on Anglesey.
Further investigation of the site by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust suggested that these items had been buried together as a hoard.
It is believed this was disturbed recently by the digging of a drainage ditch.
Wrexham County Borough Museum will now seek to raise enough money to buy the hoard, following assessment by the independent Treasure Valuation Committee.
Barack Obama promised his daughters a pet dog when he became president and ever since people have wondered what type it would be.
The dog is like a poodle with a curly coat and usually are brown or black.
The breed the family picked is important because Malia Obama is allergic to some breeds of dog.
The Obamas are hoping to get their new pet around April, which gives them plenty of time to think about names, which is probably a good thing!
They are hoping to get a rescue dog.
On the beach on the north coast of Northern Ireland, we came across a huge Newsround fan...
He said the country's ex-leader, Saddam Hussein, treated people so terribly that the UK and US would be forgiven for toppling him from power.
Blair made his comments in a speech to Congress - the US version of the House of Commons - while on an official visit.
The main reason the US and UK went to war was because they believed Saddam was hiding weapons of mass destruction.
Mr Blair also said the UK would continue to stand by the US and praised the President.
But he said the US should listen to other countries to get their support.
The American politicians were bowled over by Mr Blair's speech.
They gave him 17 standing ovations - that's when people stand up to clap because they're so impressed.
Or is it? How much does a professional game need a man who puts an appearance on "I'm a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here!" ahead of a season with his newly-promoted county?
The Tufnell of popular myth is cricket's own Stan Bowles or Rodney Marsh, a talent too hot for the authorities to contain, mistrusted, misused and missing training with calamitous hangovers.
In an era when England's cricket team was so dull that taking a ride in a biplane could signal the end of your Test career, Tufnell stood head and shoulders above the rest - or at least he would have done if he wasn't asleep in the dressing-room.
In the eyes of the public, desperate for a human face in a team that sometimes seemed to place more importance on shaving than skill, a smoking spinner with bleary eyes and a taste for champagne was easy to love.
When the alternative was Richard Illingworth - terrible 'tache, attritional action, woefully wicketless - it was never a contest.
Which is a shame, for Tufnell's public image obscures the real debate about his true merits.
One version of the story has Tufnell rendered impotent by fickle selectors who chose to put seam before spin.
He played just 11 times for the national side on English soil, yet won Tests for England at The Oval on two occasions - against the West Indies in 1991, and famously against Australia in 1997, when his 11 wickets in the match left many wondering why his call-up had come so late.
Was Tufnell a good enough cricketer to be worthy of automatic inclusion in every England squad?
And there is a chuckle to be had when, as a journalist, you go round to someone's house at 11am for a pre-arranged interview only to find your host has not been to bed, and is so "tired and emotional" that he insists on conducting conversation sitting on garden furniture in his garage rather than letting you see the state of his house.
But there is nothing charmingly roguish about assaulting your girlfriend (�1,000 fine, 1994) or wrecking your hotel room, even if you do check yourself into the psychiatric wing of a Perth hospital afterwards.
Should a sportsman who aspires to the international stage really spend the night before the first Test of a series in the West Indies getting smashed in a Kingston club?
There is letting off steam, there is being yourself, and then there is letting your team-mates down - not to mention the supporters back home.
Playing for Rest of the World XI against Asian XI in a one-day match in Dhaka, Tufnell managed to put down both Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly off his own bowling before getting them both out.
It was one of the few occasions when he recovered from a self-inflicted blow to come out on top.
"I believe the capture of such a talented player is an extremely exciting event for the club," said Rovers coach Gary Price.
"He is a player that can create situations on the field and will give us many more options, in both defence and attack.
One of the 21 excluded parties, the National Conscience party of the human rights lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, says it will contest the decision by the electoral commission in court.
A BBC correspondent in Nigeria says government opponents see the selection process as having been highly political; all three new parties are linked to powerful business and military figures.
The current government of President Olusegun Obasanjo was elected three years ago, following almost two decades of military rule.
Mr Obasanjo is seeking a second term in office in the presidential poll to be held by April next year.
In total there will now be six parties competing in local, state and national elections to be held in Nigeria over the coming months.
Barring successful legal challenges, the parties allowed to contest them are
Our correspondent says the widespread expectation is that these elections will be marred by fraud and violence.
It is a pessimistic perspective, he says, but supported by the fact that no post-independence civilian administration has ever held successful elections.
But if there is some comfort to be drawn from the present democratic system, it is that even the present three parties do not simply represent distinct ethnic divisions, but rather complex business, political and ethnic alliances.
And also that all through the civil war, military rule, and now the civilian era, Nigeria has remained remarkably stable, despite being home to more than 250 different ethnic groups.
He said he now considered the crisis "practically" over.
The dispute arose after Bogota admitted that it paid bounty hunters to capture a Colombian Marxist guerrilla in the Venezuelan capital.
Mr Chavez was speaking on a visit to Argentina where he signed a number of agreements between the two countries.
President Chavez says that the worst diplomatic rift in decades between Venezuela and Colombia has almost been resolved.
He said that Venezuela's ambassador to Bogota - who was recalled when the crisis erupted - had already returned to his post.
Mr Chavez said Thursday's state visit to Caracas by the Colombian President Alvaro Uribe should go some way towards smoothing relations between the two neighbours.
The Venezuelan leader again blamed the United States for provoking the crisis and thanked Cuba's Fidel Castro for mediating to help resolve it.
President Chavez said that by paying bounty hunters to capture a leading left-wing rebel commander in Caracas, Colombia had breached Venezuelan sovereignty.
It did not matter, he said, if it was "Jack the Ripper, Hannibal Lector or the worst mass-murderer in the world", sovereignty had to be respected.
Mr Chavez cut short a visit to Buenos Aires to return home to resolve the crisis with Colombia.
During his 24-hour stay, Mr Chavez signed an agreement with Argentina's President, Nestor Kirchner, to set up a state-owned South American TV channel.
The two countries also extended a deal whereby Venezuela exchanges fuel for Argentine cattle and grain.
The blast, which ripped off the roof and sides of the vehicle, happened during rush hour, as the bus was coming into the town of Safad from the port of Haifa.
About three hours later, a Palestinian gunman opened fire on an Israeli lorry near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City.
Police say they believe a suicide bomber was responsible, although it is not clear if the 10 dead were all passengers or included the attacker.
Many of the passengers were soldiers returning to their bases after the weekend.
The militant group Hamas has said it carried out the attack.
A statement received in Lebanon by the Hezbollah television station Al-Manar, said this was the second act of retaliation for the death of a Hamas leader - along with 14 other people - in an Israeli bombing in Gaza last month.
Hamas also claimed responsibility for the bombing of Jerusalem'sHebrew University last Wednesday that killed seven people,five of them Americans.
The Palestinian leadership condemned the bus attack as a "terrorist operation".
"We condemn this like any operation committed inside Israel," said a statement from the Palestinian cabinet.
However, the statement said Mr Sharon had undermined security efforts in the West Bank by arresting thousands of Palestinian police officers.
US President George W Bush said he was "distressed" to hear about the latest bomb attack.
Eyewitnesses at the scene of the attack described terrible scenes.
"I picked up four dead myself," Haim Ben-Shimon told ArmyRadio.
Ten of the wounded suffered serious injuries.
The Israeli Communications Minister, Reuven Rivlin, blamed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for the continuing violence.
"As long as Arafat is going to be the leader of the Palestinian people, there is no solution, there is no way to come to any kind of conciliation," he said.
In the Jerusalem shooting, a Palestinian armed with apistol opened fire on a truck belonging toIsrael's main phone company, Bezeq.
A security guard was killed and the driver was injured, police said.
A gun battle with police then broke out and an Arab bystander was killed by crossfire before the gunman was shot dead.
There was no immediate claim for the shooting.
An armed Palestinian was shot dead on Sunday as he tried to break into a Jewish settlement on the coast of the Gaza Strip, the army said.
The man, who was wearing a wetsuit, was reported to have been seen emerging from the sea armed with grenades and a rifle.
The violence comes as Israel continues a controversial policy of trying to deter would-be bombers by punishing their families.
The Israeli army is reported to have demolished several homes of suicide bombers overnight in the West Bank town of Nablus.
Two British conservation groups say the UK's system of coastal defence benefits only a few people, at the expense of irreplaceable wildlife habitats.
The report says some scientists regard the intertidal zone - the area between high and low water marks - as "more biologically productive than a rainforest".
In one case, it says, the Agency cited commercial confidentiality as the reason for not revealing cost-benefit details about a proposal to raise a sea wall around Wallasea Island in Essex.
Government departments, including the Ministry of Agriculture, have argued for a strategy of "managed retreat", abandoning some land to the sea rather than trying to protect everything.
The galaxies - in a cluster 60 million light-years away - are so small that on ordinary photographs, they look like individual stars.
"This makes them far smaller, and more compact, than any previously known galaxies.
"For comparison, the Milky Way, in which we live, is over 100,000 light-years in diameter.
"An entire UCD would fit comfortably in the space between the Earth and relatively nearby bright stars like Rigel or Betelgeuse in Orion," he added.
The European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, was also used in the study.
Phytophthora infestans, or "potato blight" still costs the industry more than £3bn a year due to crop failures.
The research, which involved the Scottish Crop Research Institute in Dundee, found the pathogen is highly adaptable and can change quickly.
The study will be used to try and curb the impact of the plant disease.
Scientists discovered that the organism boasts an unusually large genome size, more than twice that of closely related species, and an extraordinary genome structure.
Together, they enable the rapid evolution of genes, particularly those involved in plant infection.
Studies have revealed that the pathogen can outsmart its plant hosts because of its ability to change and can adapt to new plant hosts, including tomatoes or seemingly immune potato crops.
Dr Stephen Whisson, of the SCRI, said the study could have a huge impact on the industry.
"It gives us many clues as to which genes might be absolutely required for late blight disease development.
Long considered a fungus, it is now known to be a member of the oomycetes or "water moulds", which are more closely related to brown algae than to fungi.
The study's findings, which involved researchers from all over the world, are published this week by Nature.
The Falkland Islands Meat Company, headed by ex-farmer and 1982 navy veteran John Ferguson, has been increasing exports to the UK and Europe each year but is not yet profitable.
"We are not just starting a meat plant, we are starting a whole meat industry," says John.
The move has been a huge culture change for farmers, he adds.
It's the second week in a row that the hit, which features Beyonce, has been at number one.
Tinie Tempah's Pass Out stayed at number two, while Justin Bieber's Baby is at three.
Boyzone's album, called Brother, is a tribute to Stephen Gately, who was in the group and died in October 2009.
Brother returned to number one after Boyzone hosted a TV show in memory of singer.
Pedro Mendes set up both with a corner and free-kick from the left, allowing Primus time and space to head home.
Substitutes Carlos Tevez and Teddy Sheringham gave West Ham more threat, with Tevez nearly scoring before Sheringham pulled one back late on.
David James fumbled Sol Campbell's clearance out to Sheringham, who lobbed into the net from a tight angle.
The home side had the better of the opening exchanges without seriously threatening to score but when the momentum began to go Portsmouth's way, they quickly took advantage.
As the ball came in from Mendes' corner on the left, Primus shrugged off Marlon Harewood's feeble challenge to connect with a downward header, which bounced up into the roof of the net.
Sol Campbell wasted a great chance to make it 2-0 when he scooped over from close range after Sean Davis' shot was cleared off the line by Hayden Mullins.
Mendes came within inches of doubling the lead when he flashed a shot inches over the bar as West Ham showed no sign of snapping out of their lethargic mood.
On 35 minutes Yossi Benayoun's solo run and deflected shot gave the home fans something to get excited about but it was a subdued and somewhat passionless first-half display.
Primus' opening goal was his first in two years but he did not have to wait long for the second as once again Mendes crossed from the left after a Jonathan Spector handball and Primus brushed aside Mullins to head home his second.
The half-time introduction of Sheringham and Tevez for Harewood and Matthew Etherington certainly lifted West Ham but did not result in any immediate change to the scoreline.
Twice in quick succession Tevez came close to breaking his West Ham duck, flashing a shot across the front of the goal and putting a curling free-kick inches over the bar.
West Ham's pressure eventually told when keeper David James could only fumble Campbell's attempted clearance wide, as far as Sheringham, who lifted the ball in from a tight angle.
This prompted a late West Ham rally but, for all their late threat, the home side could not find a way through to James' goal and, ultimately, they paid the price for their sloppy first-half defending.
"You can't set about games like we did in the first half and expect to get things.
"I had no illusions when I came in, it's going to be a tough run-in and we've got to be confident enough that we'll get out of it.
"I don't think we got complacent, it was just down to West Ham's desire to get something from the game.
"If we had got a third goal it would have killed the game but the game was never dead.
Staff at Pederzani's, one of the city's exclusive jewellers, thought nothing amiss when a window cleaner went to work on the plate glass display.
Dressed in regulation overalls, he propped his ladder against the window.
But then, instead of using the bucket and squeegee to clean it, he calmly unscrewed it before scooping an estimated $1m-worth of jewels into his bucket and walking off into the Friday shopping crowd.
This is not the first audacious crime to hit Milan's fashion district this year.
But it added that now its founder was out of prison, advertising at its key magazines had picked up.
Despite being released from jail earlier this year, Ms Stewart still remains under house arrest for her part in a shares scandal.
The group said ads in publications such as Martha Stewart Living had increased by 42%.
The boost helped raise revenues at the firm to $46m, from $44m a year earlier.
Looking ahead, Omnimedia expected "significant improvements", chief finance officer James Follo said.
"We expect to report significant year-over-year improvements in the second half of 2005 operating results, reflecting continued improvements in circulation and advertising revenues, the September launch of new television and radio programmes, as well as the benefits associated with our Kmart contract," he said.
The group expects operating losses to narrow to between $25m and $26m during the current third quarter, and $1m to $2m in the fourth quarter - warning it would face a charge of $13m during each three month period.
The news came as the media and merchandising firm said it had agreed a deal with Discovery Communications to carry Ms Stewart's upcoming daytime TV show - Martha - and air a new home improvement reality show.
The two groups did not reveal financial details of the deal which, means the programmes will be broadcast on Discovery's US TV channel The Learning Channel.
Ms Stewart's profile - and that of her company - has experienced something of a renaissance since the start of the year.
She has agreed a $2m book deal and her firm is launching new "how-to" DVDs, a radio channel and new merchandising deals - all of which have helped Omnimedia's share price triple over the past year.
International Baby Food Action Network said the powdered formula could be responsible for the deaths of many thousands of babies who miss out on immunities passed on through breast milk.
And that firms are regularly flouting strict guidelines in a bid to boost their products.
All 16 baby milk manufacturers surveyed broke the guidelines and Nestl� were singled out as the worst offender.
Health experts throughout the world tend to agree that breast feeding is safer than using powdered milk, because it helps build up the child's immune system.
But the Baby Food Action Network (BFAN) warn that powdered milk can easily be contaminated by dirty water.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) two decades ago set up a code for the manufacturers of powdered milk, insisting that they must not provide free samples of their product to new mothers or hospitals.
Nor are they allowed to idealise the use of powdered milk in advertising.
Nestl�'s American subsidiary was criticised for its "New Mom Makeover" campaign - which used free powdered milk as prizes as a means of building up a mailing list for direct marketing.
Niels Christiansen, of Nestl� said the American promotion had now been stopped and that they were backing the code.
Boots the chemist is introducing a trial scheme at three of its branches in Manchester.
Men aged between 30 and 65 will be able to buy four pills for �50 after a consultation with the pharmacist.
But Dr Jeff Hackett, chairman of the British Society for Sexual Medicine, said many men were entitled to the drug on the NHS, without paying.
"We have some regulations at the moment that allow a large number of patients to get the drug free on the National Health Service," he said.
Men seeking the drug from the pharmacist will have to undergo some basic medical tests, and anyone wanting a repeat prescription would have to consult a doctor.
Boots pharmacist James Longdon said the men would have an hour-long consultation, including blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol checks.
He added that they would also be made aware that men with certain medical conditions could obtain the drug free of charge with a prescription from their GP.
Boots claims that only 10% of the three million men who suffer from impotence are being treated.
It said offering Viagra without a prescription could help to improve those figures.
The chemist also claimed the move would be a good way to monitor men's health, as erectile dysfunction was often a marker for a more serious underlying medical condition.
Deet has been in use for decades and is found in most of the commonly used repellents to ward off mosquitoes.
Others dismissed the concerns saying deet posed no risk when used correctly.
The study in the open access journal BioMed Central Biology shows deet works in the same way as paralysing nerve gases used in warfare.
However, experts cautioned that the findings in animals could not be translated to humans.
Deet (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) was developed by the US Army in 1946 following its experience of jungle warfare during the second world war, then registered for use by the general public in 1957.
About 200 million people use deet-based repellents every year and over 8 billion doses have been applied over the past 50 years.
Products containing deet are available in a variety of liquids, lotions and sprays that are applied to the skin to repel insects rather than kill them.
As a precaution, experts advise people to only use enough repellent to cover exposed skin or clothing and caution that repellent should not be applied to cuts, wounds or irritated skin.
But French researchers, from the University of Angers and the Institute of Research and Development in Montpellier, say more investigations are needed to discover any potential neurotoxicity to humans.
In work on rodents at the cellular level, deet blocked an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, whose job is to control one of the main chemical messengers used by the nervous system.
The researchers also found that deet interacts with carbamate insecticides, used in agriculture, increasing their toxicity.
"This makes it very difficult if not impossible to interpret the relevance of their findings to humans.
"There have been several recent studies exploring the safety and risks of deet in humans.
The US Environmental Protection Agency said it would evaluate the study and incorporate it into its future review of deet planned in 2012.
Professor Greenwood said most people tended to use deet infrequently and, therefore, were exposed to low doses.
He said more research may be warranted to investigate the researchers concerns further.
Those filing into Charing Cross police station say a new law requiring all protests near Parliament to have police permission is "ridiculous".
They have been applying individually to protest in Parliament Square next week to create more work for the police.
The Home Office says the new law is necessary for security reasons.
Under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act, all types of demonstration held within half a mile of Parliament, must first get the permission of the police.
It was initially prompted by anti-war protester Brian Haw's five-year anti-war vigil outside Parliament.
But comedian Mark Thomas, who has organised next week's demonstration, said it was ridiculous that one person wearing a badge in Parliament Square could be arrested if they did not have a licence.
"They can be fined for being opposite Parliament, the home of our democracy, with a badge - and that's nuts," he said.
Protesters queuing up for licences to demonstrate at 1800 BST next Wednesday included pro-cyclists, anti-war demonstrators, people calling for free tampons on the NHS and "Goth pride" protesters.
There have already been several attempts to protest at the ban - including holding organised tea parties in Parliament Square, and a carol service by peace campaigners.
"That was someone trying to take my eye out with a broken beer bottle," he said pointing to the circular scar almost encircling his right eye.
"And this here was a cut from a samurai sword," he added, showing a cut which extends from his hairline to his right eyebrow.
The scar sent shivers down my spine, but Abhya, who did not want to be identified, describes a confrontation with a rival group at a wedding in 2005 in Ilford, east London, in a matter-of-fact way.
Those who attacked Abhya were members of a Tamil gang.
Since 2000 Tamil gangs in London have been involved in many gory confrontations, which have resulted in 10 deaths, spurring the Metropolitan Police to set up a special task force, Operation Enver, to tackle Tamil gang-related incidents.
Abhya says he used to 'hang around with friends' and got involved in fights, but denied being in any organised gang.
Chief Inspector Derrick Griffiths, who has been involved with the special task force, said there are five main Tamil gangs in London.
They are based in East Ham and Walthamstow in east London, Wembley in north-west London and Merton and Croydon in south London.
The East Ham group is the biggest with 30 core members.
But a series of crackdowns, patrols and installing CCTV cameras on the High Street over the past 18 months has driven the gangs into hiding.
Despite these measures and a relatively quiet two years, people still live in fear as police were only able to secure convictions in two of 10 murders, said Mr Griffiths.
"All crimes were detected and people were charged but what we found was the level of intimidation was so high that we couldn't get anybody from the Tamil community to come to court and give evidence," he said.
The gang violence shocked the nearly 100,000-strong Sri Lankan Tamil community in London.
Vellupillai Jegendira Bose, 58, who owns an estate agency on East Ham High Street, faced the wrath of the gangs when he attended a community meeting called by the police.
"After the meeting I was joking with the officer that I may need protection, and when I returned someone had shattered the display window of the shop," he said.
Most of the violence has resulted from inter-gang rivalries and revenge attacks stemming from territorial control, community leaders believe.
Historically the gangs have largely been involved in credit card frauds and extortion from local businesses.
A police operation uncovered that in the past two years alone, credit card frauds by Tamil gangs amounted to �70m.
In Newham, for instance, gang members demand �10,000 to �15,000 a year from shops and businesses while they confiscate cars from people and demand up to �3,000 for their return, Mr Griffiths said.
And the money is sent to Sri Lanka to fund the struggle by Tamil Tiger rebels, he added.
But this has been repeatedly and vehemently denied by community leaders although some do believe that the Tamil Tigers use gangs to threaten people.
Mr Griffiths said they have successfully subdued some gangs by arresting and slapping ASBOs on main players, but many businessmen like Mr Bose say some should be deported to send a strong message.
Deportation is a tricky issue, said Mr Griffiths, although police have submitted at least 24 names to the Home Office.
"The boys get rid of their ID papers so when they are taken back to Sri Lanka the immigration there says we can't prove their nationality," he said.
Mala Krishnaraja, 56, who heads Tamil Community Forum, said young children are most vulnerable.
Following the recent spate of shootings in south London, which claimed the lives of three teenagers, a police report identified 169 groups, more than a quarter of which have been involved in murders.
With regard to the Tamil gangs Mr Griffiths said their next target will be money launderers and Tamil Tiger fundraisers.
Even people from the community agree that recent measures have brought the gang menace under control.
Although optimistic, Abhya believes every time a gang is subdued the next generation takes over.
Competition from larger chains and the sale of music on the internet were cited by the administrators for the problems facing Andy's Records.
The business began from a small stall in a Suffolk seaside town more than 30 years ago.
Proprietor Andy Gray was still at school when he began selling records on Felixstowe Pier.
A stall in Cambridge followed and he became the first market trader in Britain to have an account with a major record retailer.
In 1975 he opened his first shop and by 1999 there were 40 stores operating nationwide.
As the company grew its headquarters
was moved to Bury St Edmunds.
But changes in the music retailing industry forced the company to reduce the number of stores to 23, employing about 160 staff.
Despite its niche market in supplying back catalogue editions and six awards for Best Independent Retailer, Andy's Records has been overtaken by internet music sales and larger chains and supermarkets.
The administrators say restructuring the business and reducing the number of stores to 14 may allow the company to come out of administration as a going concern.
Cahill scrambled home from close range following Mikel Arteta's corner six minutes after the interval to move Everton up to sixth in the table.
It was no more than Everton deserved after carving out a host of chances, with debutant Dan Gosling twice coming close to his first senior goal.
Afonso Alves missed a chance to snatch a point for Middlesbrough late on.
Everton delivered a composed performance to record their seventh away win of the season, with only Chelsea having more.
Their recent resurgence is all the more remarkable given the fact that boss David Moyes is operating without a fit senior striker.
But Cahill has stepped into the breach in the emergency and followed up his winner at Eastlands with another crucial strike to seal three Boxing Day points.
Middlesbrough, in sharp contrast, were abject and have now gone seven games without a win.
Steven Pienaar had the ball in the net early on, but it was ruled out for a push in the area as Everton pressed for an early advantage.
Tuncay then tested Everton keeper Tim Howard, but it was a rare moment of danger for the Merseysiders in the early exchanges.
Pienaar came close after 27 minutes when Cahill set him up 12 yards out, but his shot hit the post and rebounded to safety.
Middlesbrough then had a period of pressure around the half-hour mark, with Howard saving well down low to his right from Gary O'Neill and then Joleon Lescott blocking crucially from Mido.
Everton had the final chance of the first half when Lescott only succeeded in inadvertently clearing the danger after Cahill nodded Arteta's corner into the six-yard area.
The breakthrough Everton deserved came after 51 minutes at the end of a desperate goalmouth scramble.
Cahill's initial header from another Arteta corner was blocked by Middlesbrough keeper Ross Turnbull, and when another effort from Lescott was blocked, Cahill bundled home the rebound.
Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate needed to make a change, but when he did it was an unpopular one, with jeers ringing around the Riverside when Alves was introduced for Tuncay.
We're off the pace - Southgate
Everton should have doubled their lead after 56 minutes, but Gosling somehow turned his effort over at the far post after good work by Marouane Fellaini.
Middlesbrough put on Adam Johnson in a bid to gain some momentum, and his direct style had an immediate impact, although he picked up a booking from referee Mike Riley as he dived in an attempt to win a penalty.
Youngster Gosling had been promising for Everton, and he had another chance with 14 minutes left, only for his point-blank header to be blocked by Turnbull, who suffered a cut eye in the process.
Middlesbrough's best chance came only two minutes from time when Mido flicked on a long ball, but Alves lifted the chance over with the goal at his mercy.
Everton had held out in relative comfort, and while their fans revelled in another win on the road, Middlesbrough's supporters rounded on their players at the final whistle.
"The boys are doing unbelievably with no strikers and with Tim Cahill and Marouane Fellaini working together sometimes up front and sometimes in the middle.
Chilean Mauricio Pinilla, Jamie Mole, Andy Driver and Bruno Aguiar's goals secured the points, while Graham Bayne netted for Inverness.
After a shaky start, Pinilla struck for Hearts, but the battling Highlanders replied with Bayne's shock leveller.
But Hearts then began to dominate and youngsters Mole and Driver both struck before Aguiar added a late fourth.
Hearts head coach Valdas Ivanauskas handed five players their home debuts.
Defender Tiago Costa replaced suspended Robbie Neilson, and midfielder Marius Zaliukas made their first appearances, while Pinilla, Mole and Christos Karipidis all started.
Visiting boss Charlie Christie retained the strike partnership of Dennis Wyness and Graham Bayne following their 3-1 win over Dumbarton in the CIS Insurance Cup in midweek.
Hearts were eager to impress after their midweek European exit in Athens, as they attempted to get back on track domestically.
Ivanauskas' men enjoyed the bulk of the early pressure before making an early breakthrough.
On a swift counter-attack Neil McCann supplied a tempting cross which by-passed Mole, but Pinilla eluded Dods and Tokely to side foot the ball into the net.
However, the Highlanders refused to lose confidence and they shocked Hearts with a well-taken equaliser on the half-hour mark.
Barry Wilson had time to cross and with the home defence static, forward Bayne took advantage to calmly head the ball beyond Craig Gordon.
Dennis Wyness could have added a second when he escaped Karapidis in the box, but couldn't convert a flying header after some good team-work.
Hearts quickly punished Inverness for their ill-fortune when Mole made it 2-1.
From Paul Hartley's free-kick the young striker rose to power a header into the roof of the net beyond Mark Brown three minutes before half-time.
The goal proved most welcome to a nervous home support.
Hearts confidence re-emerged and McCann, full of verve, lashed the ball against the bar with the Edinburgh club seeking to put themselves out of sight.
Ivanauskas then substituted McCann for Andy Driver and replaced Hartley with Bruno Aguiar.
And 18-year-old Driver delivered instantly with the third goal to gift Hearts the points.
The youngster showed terrific composure to lash the ball into the top of the net from a tight angle, when Tokely made a mess of clearing a Mikoliunas cross.
Aguiar added number four when he slid the ball in from seven yards from man-of-the-match Mole's assist.
The goal emphatically sealed an impressive and welcome performance for Ivanauskas.
And it was enough to extinguish the stiff Inverness challenge, as Hearts recorded their biggest-ever SPL victory over the visitors.
The 26-year-old fell awkwardly only three minutes into Everton's 0-0 draw away to Newcastle on Sunday.
The Spaniard will undergo surgery on his right knee in Barcelona next week.
Rathbone said he knew the injury was serious as soon as he saw it.
"We weren't actually waiting on the scan because we knew instantly what he had done, I said to the doctor straight away, 'that's a cruciate," he said.
"He's very down, but he's a mature guy, and knows that one of the hazards of being a top class sportsman is that you get injured.
Rathbone said Arteta will get first-class treatment as the club look to get their prized asset back to full fitness.
Arteta has been a key figure for Everton this season, making 31 appearances and scoring seven goals.
His spell out will be a huge blow to the Toffees as they continue to chase a European spot and hope to further their run in the FA Cup.
Everton boss David Moyes has already lost Yakubu for the season to a ruptured Achilles, while James Vaughan has had surgery on a knee injury and Nuno Valente has been out with a similar problem since August.
Midfielders Steven Pienaar (hamstring) and Leon Osman (stomach strain) have both missed recent games, while Anichebe was injured by a horror tackle from Kevin Nolan against Newcastle.
Everton have managed to maintain sixth place in the Premier League in spite of the injury problems but their hopes of catching fifth-place Arsenal have been dented by the loss of Arteta.
He scored in Everton's previous two games before Sunday's goalless draw and his absence was keenly felt once he left the field at St James' Park.
"We're missing important players, obviously Tim Cahill, Tim's been probably just as important as Mikel has for the last few months.
Moyes is also worried over the fitness of Victor Anichebe, who was replaced shortly before half-time after a heavy tackle from Kevin Nolan, which saw the Newcastle midfielder receive a straight red card.
This contrasts starkly with the top end, where the Japanese can expect to life healthily for 75 years - nearly three times as high.
Sub-Saharan Africa provides all of the bottom ten ranked countries in the listings for the world's 191 countries
And of the 40 worst ranked nations, Afghanistan and Haiti are the only non-African nations that appear.
According to WHO chief researcher Dr Christopher Murray, the key factors are the big infectious disease killers of HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis as well as big child killers including pneumonia and diarrhoea.
He said the healthy life expectancy in countries such as Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe has been reduced by 14 years because of the impact of Aids.
Conflict is another major problem.
And at least 50,000 people have died in the fighting while there are an estimated 100,000 mutilation victims.
The new way of calculating the number of years that a person can be expected to live in full health, known as the DALE (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) system, helps give a truer picture of the health of a country than simply studying death rates, says Who.
To calculate DALE, the years of ill-health are weighted according to severity and subtracted from the expected overall life expectancy to give the equivalent years of healthy life.
The WHO rankings show that years lost to disability are substantially higher in poorer countries because some limitations - blindness, paralysis and the debilitating effects of several tropical diseases such as malaria - strike children and young adults.
People in the healthiest regions lose 9% of their lives to disability, compared to 14% in the worst-off countries.
There are 32 countries where disability-adjusted life expectancy is estimated to be less than 40 years.
BP's chief executive has vowed to clean up a huge oil spill after an accident at one of its wells off the US coast.
Tony Hayward told the BBC's Matthew Price that BP did not cause the accident, but it would take responsibility to clean it up.
He said there was an "armada" of ships and a "small airforce" of aircraft trying to prevent the slick reaching the shore.
Many Westerners see Muslims as fanatical, violent and intolerant, according to the study by the Pew Research Center in Washington.
Muslims, for their part, tend to view the West as selfish, immoral, and greedy - as well as fanatical and violent - the survey says.
The researchers canvassed the opinions of 14,000 people in 13 countries.
BBC Islamic affairs analyst Roger Hardy says a string of events, from last year's London bombings to the more recent row over cartoons satirising the Prophet Muhammad, appear to have taken their toll on relations between Islam and the West.
The Pew Research Center's survey, published on Thursday, speaks of a "great divide" between the two.
It says that Muslims and Westerners blame each other for deteriorating relations.
Muslim people "have an aggrieved view of the West" and are "much more likely than Americans or Western Europeans to blame Western policies for their own lack of prosperity", the authors contend.
By contrast Western publics say Muslims are held back by "government corruption, lack of education and Islamic fundamentalism", they add.
The report says the "chasm" between Muslims and the West is also seen in judgements about how the other side treats women.
Westerners, by large margins, do not regard Muslims as "respectful of women", while majorities in four of the five Muslim countries said the same about the West.
Despite the divide, attitudes are not uniformly negative.
Solid majorities in France, the US and Britain retain overall favourable opinions of Muslims, while positive views of Muslims have declined sharply in Spain (from 46% to 29%), the survey notes.
It says about eight in 10 people in both Spain and Germany associate Islam with fanaticism - a view that is less prevalent in France (50%), Britain (48%) and the US (43%).
Likewise, Muslim opinion is far from uniform, with Muslim minorities in Europe often attributing positive attributes to Westerners - including tolerance, generosity, and respect for women.
On the other hand, in Muslim countries in the Middle East and Asia large majorities describe the West as "selfish", "arrogant", and "violent".
In one of the survey's most striking findings, majorities in Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, and Jordan said they did not believe Arabs carried out the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001.
The report says this attitude is not limited to Muslims in Muslim-dominated countries - 56% of British Muslims said the same.
The survey cited a dramatic drop in support for Osama Bin Laden in Jordan as a sign of falling support for terrorism in Muslim countries.
Less than 1% of respondents in the country - hit by triple hotel bombings last November - expressed confidence in Bin Laden, down from a quarter last year.
Confidence in the al-Qaeda leader had also fallen in Pakistan, where 38% of people expressed some confidence in him, down from 51%.
However 61% of Nigerian Muslims had at least some confidence in bin Laden, a sharp rise from 44% in May 2003.
Asda - with the backing of the Education Secretary, Estelle Morris - is inviting primary and secondary school pupils to discover some of the science behind the items on a typical shopping list.
It has devised activity trails and is challenging youngsters to suggest futuristic products that they can research alongside Asda scientists.
The "Big Science" initiative is supported by Science Year, the government-backed scheme to engage schoolchildren, their teachers, parents and everyone else in science matters.
"To do this we have to communicate with large numbers of school students and help them see that science drives the world they live in - it underpins their quality of life and their lifestyle and science helps deliver food on demand to a guaranteed standard.
The aim is for residential customers to take delivery of 18-litre bottles of spring or mineral water - just like those delivered to offices, usually by guys in shorts - for the dispenser sitting in their kitchens.
Mike Greeves, of Hepscott Water Systems in Northumberland, says the tiny residential market is split between water coolers and filters plumbed into the mains (a popular choice for those fed up with filling and refilling jug-type filters).
Mr Greeves instead expects more large organisations to switch from water coolers to plumbed-in filters, to save on the expense and hassle of getting bottles delivered.
In July 1572, the Protestant leader of the northern Netherlands, William I of Orange - still celebrated today as the father of the Dutch nation - publicly proclaimed the right of all individuals to freedom of thought and worship at a political assembly at Dordrecht.
He vowed "to protect and preserve the country from foreign tyrants and oppressors", and he promised the Dutch people that "the free exercise of religion should be allowed as well to Papists as Protestants, without any molestation or impediment".
Holland's immigrants have played a vital part in her rise to power and wealth - skilled Huguenot artisans were the motor behind Dutch clock- and instrument-making, Jewish commercial acumen helped build the Dutch East India Company.
His attacker impaled a five-page written statement on van Gogh's body declaring the killing an act of retribution for a film van Gogh had made drawing attention to the abuse of women within the immigrant Islamic community.
Most of the accusations in the letter pinned to van Gogh's chest were aimed at his collaborator and screenwriter, Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
What are we to think of all of this? I have heard several comments to the effect that Holland has "at last got her come-uppance" - as if the Dutch were the last Europeans to understand that a long-standing tradition of easy-going liberal tolerance had finally come to an end under the pressure of global migration and post-9/11 polarisation in the "war on terror".
He had been on holiday at the weekend when he failed to surface from a dive.
Two lifeboats, two helicopters and other vessels were involved in the search for the officer.
Pc Jackson, who served with Humberside Police for nearly 25 years, was one of seven people deep-sea diving 16 miles (26km) north-northwest of Horn Head.
He is believed to have been using an oxygen set known as a rebreather which provides a breathing gas containing oxygen and recycles exhaled gas.
"Paul died diving, a sport he loved, in Ireland, a place he loved.
"We would like to pass on our immense thanks and gratitude to all of the emergency services and volunteers who helped to find him and ensure he could be laid to rest, and especially to those people that were his friends for all they did to bring him home.
More than 800 people have died since the first British warships reached the remote UK territory on 22 April, 20 days after Argentina invaded South Georgia.
BBC correspondent Brian Hanrahan reported at 1530 local time (2030 BST) that British troops had been ordered not to use their weapons except in self-defence.
It is hoped the documents will be signed within the next 24 hours.
Mrs Thatcher told the Commons land forces commander Major-General Jeremy Moore had decided to press forward to the capital last night after a series of successful attacks on enemy troops.
"Large numbers of Argentine soldiers threw down their weapons - there are reported to be flying white flags over Port Stanley," she said.
The prime minister was welcomed outside Downing Street by a jubilant crowd cheering and singing when she returned from Westminster.
Mr Hanrahan - who is with the UK troops close to the frontline - said the Falklands felt strangely quiet after weeks listening to the noise of war.
The Falklands War is the result of years of disputed ownership of the islands.
The victory greatly boosted the popularity of Margaret Thatcher's government which went on to win the next election.
Argentine president General Leopoldo Galtieri was deposed and served three years in prison for military incompetence.
Then he crossed the Atlantic to take charge of Portugal and showed that he could succeed in a different culture.
The Chelsea job is fascinating for three reasons.
There have been previous cases of South American coaches who withdrew from European football in defeat complaining about the difficulty of forming a group from a squad comprised of 15 different nationalities.
There is no doubt that he will need considerable input from key figures already at the club - which perhaps he lacked in his previous job.
He was the youngest member of the team that won the World Youth Cup for Argentina a year ago, and afterwards he was really buzzing for Estudiantes.
As is often the case with young players - he's only 19 - I don't think he's been as good this season as he was last - opponents know a bit more about him and are looking out for him more,
I don't think the lure of the national team shirt is any weaker than before - South Americans make sacrifices to play for their national teams that many Europeans would not be prepared to go through.
Part of the point is indeed the fact that the big clubs in Russia and Ukraine pay very well at the moment - this is professional football, after all.
Pompey in much better position, says chief executive Peter Storrie
The club now have until 1600 GMT on 17 February to file a "statement of financial affairs" proving they can pay their creditors.
Pompey also claimed at the hearing they have received two "serious" offers from parties interested in buying the club.
If Portsmouth file the statement of affairs, the earliest the case could return to the High Court is Friday 19 February.
Court registrar Christine Derrett said she feared the company would continue to trade and build up more debts that would not be paid.
However, Pompey were granted extra time to settle their tax debt after arguing they had received two serious offers to buy the club.
The club is working with accountancy and insolvency practitioners Vantis to produce the necessary statement of affairs by the 17 February deadline.
"We believe the club is looking in a much better position than it was a few months ago with debts being reduced massively.
"'This is the current level of debt and this is the cash which may be coming into the company so we can present you with an accurate reading of exactly where the club is at in order to inform your decision'.
"After seven days the copy of that report will be given to the Revenue and Customs people to look at, to make their decisions and make their comments on it.
Last week Balram Chainrai, a Hong Kong-based businessman, became the club's fourth owner of the season.
Nigel Hood, representing the club at the hearing, said Chainrai would run the company until it was financially stable and then sell it on to someone who wanted to "operate the business as a football club".
He added that any move to force the club to wind up would have "very serious consequences".
"There would be irreparable harm caused not only to the suppliers but to the employees, 600 staff and people who have paid in advance for their season tickets, who would lose their money," said Hood.
Bottom-of-the-table Pompey have debts of £60m and are five points from safety following a 1-1 home draw against Sunderland on Tuesday.
Their financial woes have meant their players have been paid late on four occasions this season.
Portsmouth are also involved in a separate dispute with former owner Sacha Gaydamak over whether they have missed a deadline in paying a £9m chunk of the £28m they owe to him.
The Premier League recently withheld £2m of transfer payments and a £7m slice of TV revenue to divert to Chelsea and Watford for the signings of Glen Johnson and Tommy Smith respectively.
The 27-year-old joined the Owls on a temporary deal last March and returned for another spell in August.
In all he has made 18 starts for Wednesday, scoring six goals, and his new deal will keep him with the club until the end of the season.
Varney is set to go straight into the Wednesday squad to face Peterborough this weekend.
But under the terms of the deal he will not be allowed to play against Derby on Saturday, 20 March.
The Spaniard, French Open winner and US Open finalist last year, was treated for a back problem in the first set.
He came through that and then injured his left arm while reaching for a low shot in the third set.
Volandri had the power to trouble Ferrero but was undone in the end by his 53 unforced errors and the Spaniard came through 6-4 7-6 (7/3) 7-5.
"Everything is OK," Ferrero commented afterwards about his injury concerns.
"I went to the doctor and he told me to take someanti-inflammatories but he thinks it's going to be OK," he added.
Reid had to overcome cramp and a bout of vomiting, before he overcame Sargis Sargsian in five sets.
"I was cramping in that fourth set and then I just chuckedit all up and the cramping stopped," Reid said.
Hewitt lost the first set 6-1 to Slovakian Karol Kucera, before coming back to win 1-6 6-1 6-4 6-1.
Costa twice came from a set down before winning 6-7 (5/7) 7-5 4-66-4 8-6.
Fortune had smiled on Vacek earlier as he had only earned his place in the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying, but his luck ran out against Novak.
A school inspectors' report published last year found that the period was not often mentioned in school history lessons, with the result that many young Czechs knew very little about their country's history in the second half of the 20th Century.
People in Need, a major Czech humanitarian and human rights organisation, reached a similar conclusion while conducting information campaigns to raise awareness of human rights issues in other parts of the world.
Visiting schools to show documentaries highlighting these issues, the group became aware that many schoolchildren had only the vaguest of notions of how their parents and grandparents lived in pre-1989 Czechoslovakia.
People in Need's special information campaign "Stories of Injustice - Communist Czechoslovakia" was devised as a way of promoting discussion of the past.
During November, a series of documentaries focusing on different aspects of the communist era - from the political trials of the early 1950s to the campaign against the Charter 77 dissident movement - will be made available to schools to raise awareness.
Schools will be encouraged to invite people who suffered under communism to take part in discussions on the issues raised.
"Stories of Injustice might contribute to students' ability to critically assess various fabricated explanations and interpretations," project organiser Karel Strachota told the BBC.
The Czech Communist Party takes a somewhat jaundiced view of the project.
"People in Need are feeding very unbalanced, one-sided information to schoolchildren," the newly-elected leader of the party, Vojtech Filip, told the BBC.
Mr Filip maintains there is no need for such a campaign, and insists that there is already enough objective information available about the communist regime.
However, the Czech education ministry thinks differently.
"The ministry welcomes any accompanying activities aimed at improving the teaching of history," a statement issued by the ministry says.
Senator Jaromir Stetina - a former war reporter and human rights activist who helped set up People in Need - has also expressed his support for the project.
Mr Stetina, who campaigns for a stricter ban on the promotion of Nazism, communism and fascism, has warned of the danger of allowing the period to be forgotten.
"I am afraid that the nation's memory of this period is being lost," he told the BBC.
The pay deal, accepted by ministers, only affects those doctors not on new contracts - about 10% of the total.
Doctors said the deal will hit morale and affect the recruitment and retention of doctors across the NHS.
The number of doctors has risen by 12% since 2000 but certain specialities such as surgeons and GPs are still facing shortages in the coming years unless more staff are recruited.
Lester Ellman, of the British Dental Association, said the rise in fees put forward by the Doctors and Dentists Review Body would not help increase access to dentists either.
"Everyday we read stories about people struggling to find an NHS dentist and today's announcement will do nothing to tackle this crisis.
"The costs of running a practice, which dentists pay for themselves, are rising quickly but this is totally ignored.
But a Department of Health spokesman said the rise should be seen in the context of past increases.
"Since 1997, a consultant on minimum salary has seen their pay increase from �42,000 to �69,000.
A US spokesman said the new leader was an Egyptian militant based in Baghdad, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, who was also known as Abu Hamza al-Muhajir.
Al-Qaeda on Monday said Zarqawi had been replaced by Abu Hamza al-Muhajir.
The US said it expected Muhajir to continue the tactics of Zarqawi, killed in a US air strike in Iraq last week.
"Nothing indicates to us that he will do differently because he has been in this country for over three to four years now," Major General William Caldwell said.
A website used by Islamic militants described Muhajir earlier this week as a veteran of holy war.
The statement on the website said al-Qaeda's council had unanimously agreed to name Muhajir as Zarqawi's successor.
Analysts at the time said the name Muhajir - a pseudonym, believed to be Arabic for immigrant - suggested he was not Iraqi.
He described Muhajir as an "al-Qaeda operative, a direct associate of Zarqawi and facilitator of foreign fighters from Syria".
The Egyptian-born militant is believed to have trained in Afghanistan and helped Zarqawi form the first al-Qaeda cell in Baghdad.
Peter took up his current post as East Africa Correspondent in Nairobi six months ago, after a stint in Johannesburg covering the south of the continent.
Peter returned to Afghanistan in 2001 to cover the start of the post-9/11 war, marching into Kabul ahead of the Northern Alliance after the Taleban lost control of the capital.
From Mombasa, Peter made several documentaries including one on the return of people displaced by Sudan's long-running north/south civil war after the warring groups signed their "Comprehensive Peace Agreement" in 2005.
That project included a journey up the Nile River on a cargo boat crowded with returnees - a trip that gave him an appetite for exploring some of Africa's more remote corners.
Peter took a prominent role in the BBC's coverage of the civil war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where he met several of the conflict's most notorious warlords.

It had, it said, three priorities - education, education, education.
A former whaler says he does not accept that anybody needs to eat whale meat.
He often worked as look-out on a catcher vessel, and says he was involved in killing hundreds of whales.
But he describes his earnings from those days as "blood money".
Mr Burton, from north-east England, was speaking at a Greenpeace news conference at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting taking place in London.
He is not a Greenpeace member himself, but says he was stirred to voice his misgivings by the organisation's campaign against whaling.
He went to sea at the age of 16, and worked as a mess boy, which also involved helping on deck and in the catcher's crow's-nest.
Mr Burton accepts the case for traditional whaling in the Arctic and the Caribbean, but disputes Japan's claim that whaling is part of its culture.
Les and Beryl Lailey, of Denton, Gtr Manchester, were given the chicken in a hamper on their wedding day in 1956.
The Buxted Chicken tin remained in their kitchen cupboard until the couple marked 50 years together this month.
"We kept it safe, and I always said 'on my 50th wedding anniversary I'm going to eat that chicken' - so I did," said former soldier, Mr Lailey, aged 73.
"When we got married I'd just come out of the Army and we had very little money, so we did our own buffet.
Mr Lailey, a former soldier, said he had not felt ill since eating the chicken.
The pair met at an Irish pub in Hulme, Manchester.
"If it's done at high temperatures and under high pressure, then the process should create a tight vacuum.
When US President George W Bush arrives in Beijing he will be meeting China's Vice-President Hu Jintao, widely believed to be the favourite to succeed President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin.
Mr Jiang is expected to retire at the 16th Communist Party Congress to be held this autumn.
Mr Bush's national security adviser Condoleezza Rice has said the US leader does not plan to meet separately with Mr Hu, but she said he might see China's heir apparent at a group meeting, as he did last autumn during the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
Mr Bush still has much of his current term in office left to run, and if he is re-elected he will stay in power for at least another seven years as of now.
So the personal chemistry beween Mr Bush and Mr Hu may well set the tone for Sino-US relations in the coming years.
But others argue that Mr Hu is a "faceless apparatchik", without charisma or vision, and that his reported desire to set up a more professional civil service does not make him a liberal.
One of his most memorable public appearances on national TV was after the 1999 Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
At the time he read out a statement, authorising demonstrations outside the US and British embassies in Beijing.
Mr Hu was the first non-military leader to run Tibet but Hong Kong sources say he spent little time in Lhasa, the capital of the province, saying he disliked high altitudes.
Instead, he supervised the Tibet crackdown from Beijing, which many now regard as a dress rehearsal for the introduction of martial law during the Tiananmen Square uprising in Beijing in 1989.
Some reports say Mr Hu was one of the first provincial leaders to send a message to the central government supporting the entry of troops into Beijing in June 1989.
But some Beijing analysts say that although he is tipped to take over the leadership, Hu is not Mr Jiang's choice of heir and does not belong to the inner circle which the retiring leader brought with him from Shanghai.
Mr Jiang is expected to retire this autumn but China observers believe he may want to keep control of foreign affairs after he retires as president in 2003, in particular the key relationship with Washington.
According to the Hong Kong press, Mr Jiang may want to ensure Mr Zeng takes over the foreign policy portfolio from Qian Qichen, who will retire at the party congress this October as part of his effort to keep his finger on the pulse of China's relations with the world.
The gaming giant says that no data was lost, which means none of their customers had their personal information stolen by the hackers.
The hack actually happened a few weeks ago, but has only just been investigated.
Sony has seen a number of attacks from cybercriminals, starting with a Playstation hack that revealed 77 million users' personal details.
They have found a huge archive of paperwork stored by the National Police - a force whose reputation for violence was so bad that it was disbanded as part of a peace settlement in 1996.
Officials say the archive contains 75 million pages of documents, as well as photographic and audio evidence.
Human rights groups want the discovery to kick-start government efforts to deal with the legacy of decades of state repression of left-wing guerrillas, which had a devastating effect on Guatemala's civilian population.
They had been called by local residents worried about the safety risk from explosives which were being stored at the compound for use as evidence in trials.
"When you walk in, you are overcome by the smell of decay, and by awe at the sight of these staggeringly high piles of paper," said Kate Doyle, of the National Security Archive, an American campaign group that specialises in tracing documents.
The documents are a mixture of the every day - traffic tickets, personnel records - and the potentially critical, including filing cabinets marked "Murders" and "Disappeared".
The find is particularly important because the Guatemalan security forces have always denied the existence of documentary evidence.
"Guatemala now has documents that go into great detail about individual victims, about the operations that led to peoples' deaths," Mr Wilkinson said.
Human Rights Watch says access to the documents will help relatives still waiting to bury their dead or to learn how loved ones died.
The Guatemalan president's human rights adviser, Frank La Rue, told the BBC the government had responded positively to his recommendation for the archive to be protected "politically and physically".
Officials are preparing a decree to place the premises under formal state custody, and guards from the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office are already on duty.
As for the mammoth task of processing the archive, Mr La Rue said Guatemala was talking to the United Nations cultural organisation, Unesco, about help with funding and expertise.
The presidential adviser said the information would be made available to a planned government commission on tracing the disappeared, which will be modelled on similar panels in Argentina and Chile.
The most difficult challenge will be to use this new evidence for criminal prosecutions.
There is a "consensus" among all elements of the administration to back President Berger's human rights strategy, Mr La Rue said.
He said the security forces "have little say" because the president has halved their numbers and they have re-focused on fighting drugs.
President Berger has taken some bold steps, but the hard work starts now if he is to use this historic discovery to close with justice a dark period in Guatemalan history.

Rita Bahuguna Joshi is escorted to prison by police
Rita Bahuguna Joshi said the amount of money was so low it was demeaning.
She said rape victims should offer to compensate state chief minister Mayawati were she ever raped herself.
The incident is likely to escalate into a major political controversy given the rising tensions between the ruling Congress party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Ms Mayawati, our correspondent says.
Ms Joshi, who is being held in custody for 14 days, has apologised for her remarks.
A senior Uttar Pradesh police official, Brij Lal, said that a criminal case had been registered against Ms Joshi for allegedly "casteist" and derogatory remarks made against Ms Mayawati, Uttar Pradesh's chief minister.
Some television channels showed Ms Joshi saying that recipients of rape compensation "should throw the money back in Ms Mayawati's face and tell her that if you are raped, we will give you 10 million rupees".
Ms Joshi has been charged specifically with making provocative statements creating "disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will" between people of different castes or communities.
She has been also charged under a law which deems making "offensive" statements against lower castes and tribespeople an offence.
Attacks on Ms Mayawati would count because as a Dalit she is covered by the act.
Ms Joshi is said to have made the comments during a meeting of women party workers.
As the news of the speech spread, the authorities registered a case against Ms Joshi and police arrested her on her way back to the Indian capital, Delhi.
About 150 furious supporters of Ms Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) then marched to Ms Joshi's house in the state capital, Lucknow, and set it on fire, reports the BBC's Ram Dutt Tripathi.
A number of cars were also burned.
Ms Joshi has apologised for her comments, saying she was only trying to "expose a chief minister who has no sympathy for women".
Congress party leader Digvijay Singh criticised the decision to arrest Ms Joshi.
Relations between the two parties have been tense ever since the Congress made major inroads in this politically crucial state - Uttar Pradesh has 80 MPs in the Indian parliament - during recent general elections.
Figures published on Thursday show the privately-run jail has the highest rate of assaults on staff and prisoners.
The Prison Reform Trust figures show the �30m institution which opened three years ago, easily wins its unsavoury accolade.
In May the then director was removed and replaced by a Home Office governor after a period of unrest and sackings.
Three quarters of staff and prisoners at Ashfield have been assaulted in the past year, according to the figures.
This compares with an average of just 10% of inmates and prison officers suffering attacks at other jails elsewhere.
But, at Eastwood Park women's jail in South Gloucestershire, the number of assaults is almost double the national average at 19%.
Bristol's Horfield prison recorded a 10% rate and Gloucester, a 5% rate.
Leyhill Open prison in Gloucestershire, Erlestoke in Wiltshire and Shepton Mallet in Somerset did not record a single assault.
The Prison Service and Premier Custodial Servicesrefused to be interviewed but both issued statements.
Premier dismissed some of the concerns claiming that as the prison houses volatile young men, many incidents classed as assaults are just typical teenage behaviour.
"Northern Ireland will be nearly £50m better off as a result of today's announcement, in addition to further measures which will support businesses and households across the UK.
"Whilst the government has expected Northern Ireland like everywhere else in the UK to make savings by greater efficiency around £122m, the Chancellor announced increased provision of £116 million for the Executive to spend on its Budget.
"In addition, Northern Ireland will also receive £27 million which help fund measures including extra Winter Fuel Payment.
"However, for the short-term we must continue to prioritise frontline services and focus attention on maximising savings from back-office functions and potentially inefficient institutional structures.
"As we move into 2009-10 the Executive will need to have an even greater focus on ensuring that every pound spent on public services delivers maximum value for money so that we can continue to provide a better quality of life for all the people of Northern Ireland.
"Alistair Darling announced a new set of efficiency savings which cut the budget, cuts which will intensify for a number of years and are not offset by any increases.
"On balance this is a disappointing Budget with very little for small businesses that are struggling with the recession.
"It is not just the independent retail sector which will suffer - the local economy as a whole will be adversely affected due to the extra efficiencies required.
"In the longer-term, the NI Executive risks taking its share of the £15bn efficiency savings.
"The growth in public spending will have to slow significantly over the next few years, and Northern Ireland, with its higher dependence on the public purse, will bear a disproportionate burden as a result.
"For business, the introduction of an enhanced first-year capital allowance of 40% for one year and some extra tax support for loss-making firms is positive news, particularly for small companies which dominate the local economy.
"But the benefit is spoiled by the rise in transport costs because of the Chancellor's need to raise funds through above-inflation rises in fuel duty and this will particularly affect our SME economy.
"As hundreds of pubs are shutting across the UK each month with thousands of jobs being shed it is beyond comprehension that the Chancellor should again raise the duty on alcohol, the third increase in the last year.
"For many the local pub is the hub of their community and not just somewhere to go for a drink.
"Previous research by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board showed that visiting a pub is the most popular activity amongst tourists visiting Northern Ireland.
"There was little prospect of any major good news in this budget for Northern Ireland, and this has been proved correct.
"There are a number of welcome micro-measures which should help to stimulate investment and support struggling businesses.
"Northern Ireland may have escaped the doomsday forecasts of immediate and massive public expenditure cuts - but the dark shadow of the Chancellor's axe still hangs over Stormont.
"The Northern Ireland Executive will have to find its share of the £9bn efficiency savings, on top of its proportion of the £5bn in savings announced in November's Pre-Budget Report, although that sum still remains under negotiation between the Executive and Treasury.
"This could have been worse, but from next year, the executive will now have to review its spending priorities, as will Westminster departments and the other devolved regions.
"Today's 2% inflation-only tax rise is a missed opportunity and will do little to reduce smoking rates amongst local people.
"UCF had urged the chancellor to re-introduce a real price escalator on tobacco tax of 3% above the rate of inflation and to strengthen the government's anti-smuggling strategy.
"At this point the finance minister will have to get his head out of the sand and the Executive will have to urgently undertake a major revision of the priorities in the Programme for Government with job protection and job creation in mind.
"Let's hope that he has got it right, given the difficult times being experienced by our members across Northern Ireland.
We would welcome the measures which he has announced in relation to the construction industry, and we would be particularly keen to see the investment for emerging technologies, and green manufacturing coming on-stream as soon as possible.
"NIM is keen to work with government to develop a green technology strategy as we believe that our manufacturing sector is well placed to benefit from developments currently taking shape.
"While we welcome the commitment to cut carbon emissions by 34% by 2020 and the extra £1bn support for low-carbon industries, we feel that the chancellor has missed an opportunity to create a low-carbon economy by putting significant investment into renewable energy and creating thousands of jobs.
"The car scrappage scheme will attract more foreign imports and will not create jobs within the UK economy, so from that point of view it seems wasteful.
"We will be urging the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that if budget savings are to be found, government departments focus on ensuring that front-line services to the farming community are not affected.
"Farming families and rural dwellers tend to have limited or no access to public transport services and have longer travelling distances.
Mr McAleavey chaired a panel of voluntary group representatives who gathered to watch Mr Darling deliver his Budget.
"The consensus was that this was an election budget and the Chancellor did the absolute best that he could in very grave economic circumstances.
"The Executive could have a little more cash but above-inflation allocations in some departments will have to be offset by significant cuts elsewhere.
"Furthermore, it is not clear immediately the extent to which this region will be expected to share the pain of efficiency savings before 2011.
"The pre-announced hikes in income tax, changes to allowances and squeeze on pension contribution relief will have limited impact on Northern Ireland given the skew in the local earnings distribution but look quite punitive nonetheless and a potential blow to enterprise.
"As predicted by Sinn Féin, the British Chancellor has reneged on previous British Government assurances that the executive could retain and reinvest efficiency savings in frontline services and infrastructural projects.
"What Alistair Darling has announced today runs contrary to earlier commitments by the British government with respect to efficiency savings in the absence of a Peace Dividend.
"While some parties seem to believe that the extra money announced in the budget today for the north goes some way to compensating for the additional £123m extra efficiency savings now being imposed for years 2010/2011, they are overlooking the fact that this is in effect a cut of £123m in the Block grant that will not be recovered in subsequent years.

Official figures from the government show that pupils starting secondary school are more likely to be in an accident than primary school kids.
A report by the charity Living Streets says this is because younger kids aren't allowed to walk to school.
Then, when older kids do start walking, they don't know about the dangers.

World number 51 Berrer, who reached the final in Zagreb earlier this year, won only five points in the opening set.
He won 18 in total and there were huge cheers when he claimed his only game, but Nadal's forehand winner down the line sealed the match in 54 minutes.
Top seed Novak Djokovic breezed through but fourth seed Marin Cilic went out.
Second seed Nadal was on course for his first professional 'double-bagel' 6-0 6-0 success but sent a backhand wide at 30-40 in the sixth game of the second set.
It did not delay him long, however, as he extended his winning streak in the competition to 29 matches.
"I played better than yesterday because I played higher, I played close to the lines, and my feeling is that I had more control on the ball than yesterday," said Nadal.
The British duo went down 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 10-2 to world number two pairing Bob and Mike Bryan of the USA.
Shahid and Mino Akhtar were born in Pakistan and, like their son and three daughters, they are devout Muslims who attend the mosque regularly.
Meeting them at their house in a quiet tree-lined street in Emerson, New Jersey, it soon seems clear that they, and their progressive Islam, are as perfectly adapted to life in modern America as their Christian neighbours.
Mino Akhtar says connection with God is what counts.
American Muslims' determination to grasp the basic principles of their religion - rather than the sometimes harsh rules contributed by other cultures during its long history - grew out of the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers.
Laleh Bakhtiar is a Muslim scholar who has translated the Koran, making controversial changes in standard translations which she says more accurately reflect the original spirit of the religion.
Shaykha Fariha says that apart from these shared principles, Islam has what the founder of her order described as the ability to behave like water - taking on the shape of the vessel into which it is poured.
She says Muslims in many parts of the world are shedding the cultural restrictions inherited from male-dominated and conservative societies.
But the Akhtar family insist that their modern lifestyle in secular America does not stop them practising what they call "the beautiful values of Islam".
Mona Akhtar, a lawyer, bubbles rose-flavoured smoke through an after-lunch shisha, and contemplates her emancipated sisters.
When the red-shirts breached parliament, some officials were evacuated by helicopter
In a televised address, Mr Abhisit said the move - which gives sweeping new powers to the security forces to tackle protesters - would help restore order.
It comes hours after thousands of "red-shirt" protesters marched on parliament - forcing MPs to flee the building.
The protesters want Mr Abhisit to resign and call elections.
Thailand has lurched from one crisis to another since 2006 when the government of Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown.
This is the fourth state of emergency in the capital since 2008.
The current bout of red-shirt rallies began on 12 March.
The government had vowed not to use force against the red-shirts, and the protesters too had said their demonstrations would not be violent.
But Mr Abhisit said in his televised address that the protesters could no longer be considered peaceful after their march on parliament.
"Our goal is to restore normalcy," he said.
Mr Abhisit said the state of emergency applied in the capital and surrounding areas, but it is not yet clear how the authorities will implement the new laws, the BBC's Rachel Harvey in Bangkok says.
Emergency law gives sweeping powers to the security forces and in theory bans public gatherings of more than five people, our correspondent says.
But tens of thousands of anti government protesters remain in the commercial heart of Bangkok and show no signs of moving voluntarily.
They regard Mr Abhisit's government as illegitimate as it was brought to power with military support.
A minister attached to Mr Abhisit's office said the authorities would disperse protesters, detain protest leaders and search their houses.
Thousands of red-shirts had earlier gathered outside parliament and were faced with similar numbers of riot police.
The parliamentary session was abandoned shortly after it had begun and senior politicians, including Mr Abhisit, were ushered out of the building by security guards.
While some MPs used ladders to scale walls as they escaped parliament, others were picked up by a military helicopter which landed on the roof of the building.
A group of protesters then barged their way into the grounds of parliament, but retreated shortly afterwards and there were no reports of violence.
Most of the support for the red-shirts comes from rural areas and the urban poor, who benefited from many of Mr Thaksin's populist policies.
On the other side of Thailand's political divide, the urban middle classes and traditional political elite - who protest dressed in yellow - back the current government.
Cricketer Mark Ramprakash and rugby star Matt Dawson will now go through to next Saturday's final hoping to win the fourth series of the BBC One show.
Previous winners were Darren Gough, Jill Halfpenny and Natasha Kaplinsky.
The series sees celebrities paired with professional dancers and challenged to learn new dances in a week.
This week Bunton and the other contestants had to impress the panel of judges with their own versions of the Argentine tango, salsa, foxtrot and quickstep.
Ramprakash and his partner Karen Hardy scored the highest points of the series when the four judges awarded them 39 out of 40 for their Argentine tango.
Scenes featuring 24's lead star Kiefer Sutherland had to be halted at a military base near Irvine, Orange County, because of the smoke.
Other series were also hit, trade publication Hollywood Reporter said.
Fierce winds are fanning at least 16 fires that have razed land from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border, forcing 500,000 people out of their homes.
Scenes were shot on the programme's dedicated stages instead.
"By 1 pm we're back here and had shot two other scenes," line producer Michael Klick told the Hollywood Reporter.
ABC boardroom drama Big Shots had to scrap shooting in Malibu, while crime series NCIS - which uses stages so close to the fires that the smoke was visible from the set - carried on filming, but lost crew members who had to protect their homes.
The fires are putting homes at risk in seven counties where up to 300,000 acres (120,000 hectares) have been scorched.
Actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta spoke earlier this week about their fears over the fires.
One of the areas affected is the coastal region around Los Angeles, which is home to many celebrities, including actors Mel Gibson, Barbra Streisand, Richard Gere, Pierce Brosnan, Dick Van Dyke and Ted Danson.
Singers Sting and Olivia Newton-John, director James Cameron and music mogul David Geffen also live locally.
Hollywood star Halle Berry's house in Malibu is just a mile from the encroaching blaze.
"I'm very worried - not only me but all the people there, people I know, my friends, neighbours," she told BBC One's Breakfast, in an interview to be broadcast on Thursday.
Referring to her current trip to London, she said it made her feel "so far away".
Several hundred thousand people havebeen moved into emergency accommodation while they wait for the waters to subside.
From Germany and Austria to Russia's Black Sea, summer storms have swollen rivers, pushed dams to breaking point and triggered landslides.
The River Danube, now an angry brown torrent along much of its long route through Europe, is causing some of the most concern.
Troops and civilians have joined forces in a massive sandbagging operation along the Danube and other rivers.
Farmers have watched helplessly as crops and land were lost, and tens of thousands of people have been moved from their homes.
Nearly 60 people - most of them holidaymakers - were killed in flash floods last weekend at a holiday resort on Russia's Black Sea coast.
Fifteen others were missing, and Russia's Interfax news agency said up to 4,000 tourists were still trapped in the devastated coastal village of Shirokaya Balka.
Germany has been among the hardest hit countries.
At least 12 people are reported dead, most of them in the eastern province of Saxony, and six others are reported missing.
In Dresden, water from burst banks on the river Elbe has submerged some of the city's historic squares and palaces.
The flood tide is advancing to new areas, and army helicopters have been airlifting hospital patients to other cities.
Thousands of people have been evacuated from Dresden, and other East German cities such as Chemnitz and Leipzig.
Authorities are expecting the waters to continue to pour northwards, and there are already reports that Brandenburg is under threat.
There are fears of an environmental disaster if the chemical plants at Bitterfeld, which lies on the river Mulde's path, is flooded.
Austrian authorities say the situation there is improving, with water levels falling and Vienna no longer threatened.
In the town of Krems, the Danube floodwaters rose so high that residents were urged to seek refuge on higher floors of their homes.
Czech authorities are starting to assess the damage in Prague, with water levels easing after their Wednesday peak.
Efforts to shore up defences and prevent further damage to the city's historic buildings are continuing.
France has sent two planes carrying emergency aid to the Czech capital.
At least 11 people died in the worst floods to hit the country in centuries.
Romania was hit by violent storms, including a tornado which killed a mother and her baby.
Homes were flattened as the storms swept through.
Grapes and olives have been hit, as well as soft fruit and vegetables.
Switzerland has escaped the worst of the floods.
The river port of Basel was brought to a standstill after heavy rains swelled the Rhine river, but the port was reopened on Tuesday.
The Slovak capital, Bratislava, is facing huge floods, with the Danube at its highest levels in over a century.
A state of emergency was declared on Wednesday, and soldiers worked through the night to reinforce flood barriers.
The Slovak Interior Ministry has said it expects the Danube to continue rising until Friday, but is optimistic that flood defences will prevent major damage.
However, there have been widespread power cuts, and reports that some people have been travelling to work by boat.
Recent resolutions in the US and Sweden have called the killings "genocide".
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the BBC that of 170,000 Armenians living in Turkey "70,000 are Turkish citizens".
Mr Erdogan was speaking in an interview with the BBC's Turkish Service, in which he was asked about the recent votes by lawmakers in the US and Sweden.
The resolutions, recognising the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as "genocide", were passed narrowly, and in both cases Turkey reacted angrily.
Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sarkisian was quoted as telling parliament on Wednesday that Mr Erdogan's comments only reminded Armenians of the mass killings.
"These kinds of political statements do not help to improve relations between our two states," he said.
Diplomatic moves to normalise relations between Turkey and Armenia have faltered recently.
Turkey accepts that atrocities were committed but argues they were part of the war and that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people.
Armenia wants Turkey to recognise the killings as an act of genocide, but successive Turkish governments have refused to do so.
Armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognised internationally as genocide - and more than 20 countries have done so.
Doctors from Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire studied the case of a man who was admitted to hospital suffering confusion during the day and hallucinations at night.
Hospital staff originally thought the 65-year-old man, who also suffered bronchitis and was overweight, was suffering from dementia.
But he was referred to a specialist respiratory unit when his wife mentioned that he snored heavily, with periods of choking and breath-holding.
Doctors writing in the Lancet medical journal say they think the snoring problem interacted with the man's bronchitis to produce hallucinations.
The specialist respiratory unit found that he was suffering a condition known as obstructive sleep apnoea.
It occurs when a person's airway becomes constricted, causing them to snore loudly as they struggle for breath.
The unit's tests showed that the level of oxygen in the man's blood often dropped to very low concentrations while he was asleep.
The man was given oxygen via a mask while he slept and this alleviated the alarming symptoms for a year, after which time they returned.
He later suffered pancreatic failure, which was unconnected to his snoring, and died.
The doctors say sleep apnoea combined with bronchitis could cause progressive carbon dioxide retention, leading to the man's symptoms.
Barbie Millicent Roberts is a woman with a very controversial reputation and mostly it stems from her long legs, tiny waist, ample bosom, slender neck and flowing blonde locks.
But others insist the proportions are unrealistic at best and damaging at worst.
That's a lot more achievable than one in 100,000, giving weight to the argument that pressure is put on girls and women to be an unrealistic size.
In a submission to the Pay Review Body, they say increased funding for the health service should be used to improve the wages of nurses, midwives and health visitors.
Nursing unions argue that poor pay is making it difficult to recruit and retain staff.
The UK Government and the Scottish Executive have pledged record levels of funding for the NHS.
Doctors have already secured pay rises on condition they reform the way they work and nurses want a similar deal.
Nursing representatives in Scotland claim that poor pay is making recruitment difficult.
The number of nursing vacancies increased by 12% last year, while the number of posts vacant for three months or more soared by 82%.
Unions would like to see a pay rise of about 20% to bring nurses into line with teachers and police officers.
However, ministers say they will not allow extra investment to be used up by pay settlements across the board.
The Scottish National Party has promised nurses an 11% pay rise if it wins power at next year's Holyrood elections.
The party said the move would cost �150m a year and would create a starting salary of almost �19,000.
However, the executive accused the SNP of attempting to "drive a wedge" between Scottish staff and those elsewhere in the UK over pay.

At the end of an emotional day that saw Bill and Hillary Clinton visit communities on both sides of the sectarian divide, the president lit Belfast's Christmas lights from behind a bulletproof screen.
Standing in front of a giant Christmas Tree shipped over from Belfast's twin city, Nashville, Tennessee he told the thousands of Clinton fans that America and Northern Ireland were "partners for security, partners for prosperity, and most important, partners for peace".
The president and the first lady had spent the day mobbed by ecstatic crowds both on the Protestant Shankill Road and the Catholic stronghold of the Falls Road.
Then after a short helicopter ride to Londonderry, Northern Ireland's predominantly nationalist second city, tens of thousands waving the American flag, the Stars and Stripes, turned out in the bitter cold to greet the couple, who were accompanied by SDLP leader John Hume.
But it was a nine-year-old girl that provided the most poignant moment of the day just hours after Mr and Mrs Clinton arrived in Northern Ireland.
Catherine Hamill was one of two children - one Protestant and one Catholic - chosen to read a message to Mr Clinton before his address to workers at the non-sectarian Mackies Metal Works in West Belfast.
She recalled the time her father, Patrick, had been shot dead by the Ulster Freedom Fighters in 1987.
Clearly moved, the president made his speech urging both sides in Northern Ireland to maintain the 15-month-old ceasefire through continued dialogue.
Unionist politicians who believe he is biased towards Catholics will have been pleased to hear him condemning "punishment beatings".
On their way from Aldergrove airport Bill and Hillary Clinton had stopped the motorcade to for what seemed to be an impromptu bit of shopping at Violet Clarke's grocery shop in the Protestant Shankill Road.
Later, in the Catholic Falls Road, the couple "happened" to meet Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams when they popped out of their limousine to visit McErlean's bakery.
He had urged all three to use a "twin-track" process to talk through their differences.
Only two months later hopes for a lasting peace were shattered when the IRA broke its ceasefire by bombing London's Docklands on 10 February 1996.
The IRA announced a new ceasefire in July 1997 but negotiations and sporadic violence continued until the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in May 1998.
The problems of decommissioning persisted despite the IRA's more relaxed stance over time which resulted in the opening up of some of its arms dumps to international inspectors.
In July 2005 the IRA declared an end to its armed struggle and two months later the decommissioning body announced the IRA had destroyed all its weapons.
Taylor won an enthralling final against Kevin Painter in which 'The Power' was forced to recover from 4-1 down before clinching an epic deciding set 6-5.
"I think I dropped a fraction on what I can do," he said after his 7-6 win.
But Taylor insisted his appetite for the game had not diminished.
"My target is to win every tournament I enter, and the world championship is extra special," said the 43-year-old, who lost another epic final against John Part 12 months ago.
Painter allowed 4-1 and 5-3 leads to slip but said he had no regrets after missing out on his first title at the Circus Tavern.
Time and again, in both referendums and presidential elections, his supporters turned out in their droves to grant him a clear victory when opinion polls had predicted a close race or even a loss for the left-wing leader.
But this time, with his plans for a 21st Century socialist revolution laid out in front of the Venezuelan people, he suffered rejection - albeit by the slenderest of margins.
Among the proposals that were rejected was a plan to shorten the working day and lower the voting age from 18 to 16.
There were also plans to alter the extent of the president's control over the military and remove the autonomy of the Venezuelan central bank.
But by far the most controversial measure was a proposal to grant the president the right to stand for re-election indefinitely.
Whether this was the point which caused traditional supporters to vote against the president is not clear.
One of the student leaders involved in mobilising the "No" campaign, Francisco Hernandez, told the BBC that the result represented a wider rejection of plans to take Venezuela towards a socialist state.
So where does this leave the president's plans?
Hugo Chavez still has almost complete control of the national assembly, has been granted the so-called "enabling law" for the next year, which allows him to pass legislation without recourse to parliament, and his current term runs until 2013.
And, of course, the price of oil, on which much of Venezuela's economy rests, is about $100 a barrel.
Mr Chavez remains steadfastly set on a course to further the reforms he has already put in place, which he and his supporters say have vastly improved the lives of the country's poor.
The referendum has undoubtedly been a blow to his plans.
But in his televised speech, President Chavez said that his plans were only derailed "for now" - in reference to the famous quote he made after leading a failed coup attempt in 1992.
"To me this is not a defeat," Mr Chavez said.
He would continue the battle to establish socialism in Venezuela, he said, and his proposals to reform the constitution remained "alive".
Like it or not, the programme is becoming almost as big a fixture on the UK's summer calendar as Wimbledon or the cricket.
Last year more than nine million viewers turned in to see 22-year-old IT worker Kate Lawler win the �70,000 contest.
On Friday, a dozen more unknowns will enter the purpose-built house at Elstree studios in Hertfordshire for their heady share of 24-hour surveillance and instant tabloid glory.
Channel 4 production staff have spent more than six months trying to make sure that series four matches the success of its predecessors.
They have ploughed through more than 10,000 application videos sent in from all corners of the UK before seeing 2,700 would-be housemates at auditions across the country.
Potential contestants have been given a series of tough psychological tests to assess their suitability.
Staff worked through a shortlist of 50 names before selecting the final 12.
If any of the names are leaked to the media before they enter the house, replacements will have to be drafted in.
A 12-strong reserve list has also been drawn up to meet any eventuality.
Gigi Eligoloff, the show's executive producer, said the idea of this year's programme was to get "back to basics".
"We want to focus much more on the group dynamic this year," she said.
The Big Brother house has been redesigned to make it more intimate in a further effort to return to the show's roots.
It follows criticism of last year's series in which housemates were divided by plastic bars into "rich" and poor" sections.
Ms Eligoloff said however the environment was altered, it was the relationships between the 12 contestants that made it compulsive viewing.
She admitted producers were seeking "completely fresh people" in order to avoid similar personalities to previous shows.
But she cautioned against contestants treating the programme purely as a springboard to stardom.
"It isn't a stage for budding presenters, singers and actors," she said.
"We put them through stringent psychological tests with questions designed to weed out people who are not going to be able to cope with the experience.
"I don't think there's any currency in watching people have a nervous breakdown on television.
Downloads will count towards the Top 40 for the first time this week and chart authorities have said it will be safe.
But Guy Holmes, chairman of Gut Records, which has had success with Tom Jones, Space and Uniting Nations, said some labels could try to expose flaws.
"It's not a slight problem - it's a huge problem," he told BBC News.
He said the unnamed labels may attempt to download specific singles many times in an attempt to inflate their chart success.
"I know of two different labels who are considering buying records online because they believe it's the only way they can teach the chart people that the security of the chart is no longer there," he said.
Mr Holmes said it would take several thousand additional sales to push a song from number 20 into the Top 10 and onto Top of the Pops.
With songs costing about 79p-99p each online, that would be money well spent for some labels, he added.
Official UK Charts Company (OCC) charts director Omar Maskatiya warned any label caught chart-fixing could be banned from the chart.
"We will treat hyping in the digital world in exactly the same way as we do for physical formats," he said.
Security systems are expected to look for the same credit card or mobile phone numbers buying multiple copies of the same song.
He added that eight months of running a separate download chart had given them a knowledge of buying patterns that will help them spot unusual activities.
A study of 50,000 post-menopausal women found eating just a quarter of a grapefruit daily raised the risk by up to 30%.
The fruit is thought to boost levels of oestrogen - the hormone associated with a higher risk of the disease, the British Journal of Cancer reported.
But the researchers and other experts said more research was still needed.
The women had to fill in questionnaires saying how often they ate grapefruit and how big their portions were.
The researchers, at the universities of Southern California and Hawaii, found that women who ate one quarter of a grapefruit or more every day had a higher risk of breast cancer than those who did not eat the fruit at all.
Previous studies have shown that a molecule called cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in metabolising oestrogen hormones.
And grapefruit may boost blood oestrogen levels by inhibiting this molecule, allowing the hormones to build up.
The researchers found that in women who ate at least a quarter of a grapefruit daily, levels of oestrogen were higher.
And they said this was the first time a commonly eaten food had been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in older women.
However, they warned that more research was needed to confirm the findings which may have been affected because they only took into account intake of the fruit, but not grapefruit juice.
Breast cancer accounts for almost a third of all cancers in women, and previous lifestyle factors linked to the disease include drinking alcohol and being overweight.
"However, this study is simply a piece of the jigsaw that will eventually help us to understand how our diets affect our health.
However, she said that some dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers and that a diet rich in a variety of different fruits and vegetables could help reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers.
Beating traffic jams 'like a fish'
The tiny robots, called Eporo, can move in a fleet without bumping into their travelling companions.
It is the second time the firm has looked to the animal kingdom for inspiration for its designs.
Last year, the manufacturer unveiled its BR23C robot, which was modelled on the behaviour of bumblebees.
The bee also displays anti-collision behaviour but tends to fly solo.
The new three-wheeled robot, which will be shown off at Japanese design fair Ceatec on 6 October, is designed to travel in a group of up to seven vehicles.
Each uses a laser range-finder to measure the distance between obstacle.
The data is constantly shared between peers via radio, allowing the group to travel as a "shoal" without bumping into each other.
The technique allows the cars to travel side-by-side or quickly switch direction as a group.
"We, in a motorised world, have a lot to learn from the behaviour of a school of fish in terms of each fish's degree of freedom and safety," said Toshiyuki Andou, principal engineer of the project.
Leading Aircraftsman Ronald Maddison, from County Durham, 20, died after sarin was dabbed on his arm at the laboratory on Salisbury Plain, in 1953.
The High Court has approved a deal between the MoD and family which means the inquest verdict from 2004 stands.
The MoD has admitted "gross negligence" rather than a lack of consent.
But the 400-strong Porton Down Veterans Group said the settlement "smothers" evidence that Mr Maddison never gave his informed consent to the test which killed him.
The original inquest in 1953 reached a verdict of death by misadventure but in 2004, a Wiltshire coroner's jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf had granted permission for the second inquest following a campaign by Leading Aircraftsman Maddison's family and an inquiry by Wiltshire Police.
When it became known that the MoD intended to seek a judicial review of the second inquest verdict - despite admissions that there had been negligence - armed services veterans responded with a barrage of criticism.
Lilias Craik and other veterans will continue with their claims for compensation.
He also accused the MoD of "using the public's money" to try to overturn the verdict of the Wiltshire coroner's jury.
"The retention of a verdict of unlawful killing ensures that the message resulting from that second inquest is not diluted.
Mr Lakhani has been charged with trying to sell a portable missile to an FBI agent posing as a member of al-Qaeda.
It follows a failed attack last year on an Israeli passenger jet over Kenya with shoulder-launched rockets, and comes at a time when BA has grounded all flights to the east African state and Saudi Arabia.
Such events seem to have opened a new, and deeply disturbing, chapter in terror tactics.
Although such weapons have a limited range, passengers jets are vulnerable shortly after take-off and before landing.
While some military aircraft, particularly smaller ones, are fitted with defence systems to protect against small missiles, most commercial planes are not.
But this is of little use against advanced, heat-seeking weapons such as the Igla SA-18, which Mr Lakhani is accused of trying to sell.
These are equipped with an electronic guidance system which pinpoints the heat of an aircraft's engines.
Instead of chaff, lighted flares are dropped by an aircraft; their intense heat drawing the missile off course and into a mid-air explosion.
That's fine for the military, but in built-up areas around airports there would inevitably be strong opposition to the use of flares which may be a fire hazard when they land.
A safer, but more costly alternative would be lasers.
Last year the Pentagon agreed to pay $23m to fit laser protection systems to four C-17 military cargo planes - an aircraft similar to the Hercules.
Once the rocket's trajectory is logged, a "jam head" fixed to the plane fires a high-intensity laser which confuses the warhead, sending it off course.
This all happens in a split second and the system is fully automatic, so demands no intervention by the pilot.
But will airlines, which are already strapped for cash, splash out the $2-3m per plane it costs to install this sort of equipment?
For David Schmieder, a senior research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, they should be thinking less about stopping missiles and more about limiting the damage they might do.
Making the fuel tanks inert or toughening components are two possibilities, says Mr Schmieder.
Aviation specialist Chris Yates spurns the theory.
Deputy Justice Minister Hugh Henry said it was the fans themselves who could drive bigotry from football grounds.
He said the Scottish Executive had launched a number of initiatives to tackle sectarianism and new laws had been used to target bigoted behaviour.
But Mr Henry said fans also held the responsibility to "report it rather than ignore it".
"I want this season to be the one where ordinary fans show the red card to the mindless, sectarian minority who tarnish the reputations of the clubs they claim to support," he said.
The executive, police, football clubs, and faith groups have been working together to tackle sectarianism, which has been a long-standing problem in the west of Scotland.
Rangers and Celtic football clubs have launched the Old Firm Alliance, taking football coaching and anti-sectarianism into schools throughout Glasgow.
Around 50,000 young people have received anti-sectarianism wristbands in an initiative with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Hospice Association.
And First Minister Jack McConnell hosted the country's first sectarianism summit in February this year.
Education secretary Ruth Kelly is announcing new plans to get schools to work together to deal with disruptive kids who stop other children learning.
The Conservatives, the government's rivals, want to give heads more power to exclude badly behaved children and send them to special schools.
The annual school inspectors' report is expected to highlight how badly behaved kids hold other children back.
Mrs Kelly apparently wants schools to get together to set up special units for kids who have been removed from normal lessons because of their behaviour.
Birmingham boss Steve Bruce confirmed Matthew Upson will go straight into the team after the defender completed is move from Arsenal.
The Blues next play on 1 February when they meet Bolton in a Premiership relegation battle at the Reebok stadium.
Upson is the sixth player to join the Blues since the re-opening of the transfer window.
The fee is thought to be worth �1m initially and rising to about �3m depending on appearances.
Bruce was delighted to have added to his squad, which has been hit by injuries recently.
Upson admitted the prospect of regular first-team football helped him make a difficult decision to leave Highbury, after Gunners' boss Arsene Wenger expressed his admiration.
Leeds were reported to be looking at Upson as a possible replacement for Jonathan Woodgate, who has been linked with a move to Newcastle.
Upson had not talked to Leeds about joining the Elland Road outfit but knewboth clubs had been in contact.
Bruce's playing career at the highest level with Manchester United proved abig attraction in joining Birmingham.
Upson joins Piotr Swierczewski, who has arrived on loan from Marseille, Ferdinand Coly, Christophe Dugarry, Jamie Clapham and Stephen Clemence as new arrivals in the past three weeks.
Victor Conte, who founded the company Balco, also known as the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, reached a plea agreement with prosecutors.
So too did Vice-President James Valente and sports trainer Greg Anderson.
All three are due to be sentenced later in the year for their part in what was the largest ever US doping scandal.
A fourth man accused in the case, track coach Remi Korchemny, has not yet agreed a plea, and is due to return to court later this month.
The men were accused of supplying performance enhancing drugs to more than 30 of the biggest names in athletics, baseball, and American football.
Greg Anderson is the personal trainer of major league baseball player Barry Bonds.
Prosecutors have agreed to drop dozens of charges against the three men in return for their pleading guilty to conspiring to distribute steroids, and, in the case of Conte and Anderson, money laundering.
The decision means that the case now will not be brought to trial, sparing athletes such as former Olympic gold medallist, Marion Jones, and one-time 100-metre record holder Tim Montgomery from possibly having to testify in court about the use of drugs in sport.
The Balco scandal broke almost two years ago when federal agents raided Conte's offices, searching for the source of a new and previously undetectable steroid, know as THG.
That inquiry led to the suspension of more than a dozen top athletes and widespread concern about rampant use of steroids in America's national game, baseball.
It raised questions about what had previously been regarded as remarkable sporting achievements, such as home-run records by particularly muscular players.
Gregg in London wanted to know if the skills he had learnt then came in useful now he was president.
Trying to manipulate conversations or turning meetings to your advantage is surely a basic prerequisite if you are a spy.
On behalf of our BBC audience, I had raised energy security - top of Mr Putin's G8 agenda, after all - and Moscow's row with the new pro-Western government in Kiev.
I was reminded of an interview I once did with the judo trainer who taught Putin when he was at school.
The Russian president had agreed to this long internet interview - with more than half the questions coming from the BBC's worldwide audience - to polish up his image ahead of the G8 summit in St Petersburg next week.
He knew there would be tough questions.
He almost seemed to relish the chance to argue his case.
And he thanked BBC internet users for complaining how hard it was to get Russian visas, so he could lash out at European countries for problems Russians encountered in their turn.
It was so different from the Vladimir Putin of the first BBC webcast we did with him five years ago, when he had not yet been a full year in office.
Then he seemed at times hesitant, and visibly bridled when asked pointed questions.
So did he succeed in his mission to enhance his image? The Kremlin seemed to think so.
If he was annoyed, he tried not to show it.
As the event wound up and the cameras were switched off, members of the Kremlin press corps, who had been watching on a monitor in another room, crowded into the studio.
Mr Putin, apparently enjoying himself, invited further questions.
Gordon Brown has paid tribute to Harry Patch, the last World War veteran in Britain, who has died at the age of 111.
He called Harry Patch ''the last of a generation of heroes and courageous people who served our country''.
The prime minister said it was fitting to hold a national memorial service to remember the sacrifice of WWI servicemen and women.
Sir Malcolm Rifkind's election as the MP for Kensington and Chelsea marked the former foreign secretary's return from eight years in the political wilderness.
He was one of political big beasts to fall in 1997, a victim of Labour's landslide, and he failed to regain Edinburgh Pentlands in 2001.
As soon as he won the safe Tory seat of Kensington and Chelsea he was brought back into the shadow cabinet by Michael Howard as work and pensions spokesman.
Sir Malcolm prospered under Margaret Thatcher rising through the ministerial ranks to become transport secretary, and then defence secretary and foreign secretary under John Major.
He is firmly identified with the left of the Conservative Party.
He lectured at the University of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) from 1967 to 1968 before returning to Scotland to pursue his legal and political ambitions.
In 1970, he was called to the Scottish Bar and four years later Sir Malcolm entered the House of Commons as the Conservative MP for Edinburgh Pentlands - a seat he represented for 21 years.
Sir Malcolm was quickly noticed by Margaret Thatcher who made him spokesman on Scottish affairs in 1975.
Just one year later his career suffered a temporary setback when he resigned the position in protest at Mrs Thatcher's hostile views on the establishment of a Scottish assembly.
Mrs Thatcher held no long-term animosity towards Sir Malcolm and appointed him as under secretary of state at the Scottish Office when she swept to power in 1979.
In 1983 he was promoted to minister of state at the Foreign Office, and three years later he became Scottish Secretary.
That appointment made him a full member of the UK cabinet, a position he would occupy in different roles for the next 11 years.

Branston, 30, agreed a two-year deal at the Pirelli Stadium despite interest from Torquay United.
He spent just a month at Meadow Lane before moving to Kettering and taking over as captain.
The defender has also had loan spells with Colchester, Plymouth, Lincoln, Wycombe, Rochdale and Northampton.
Branston said he was thrilled with his move back into the Football League and has no plans to drop his aggressive approach as newly-promoted Burton look to gain a foothold in League Two.
Germany is expected to pass legislation tomorrow to enable financial assistance for Greece, the day after the Greek president Karolos Papoulias described his country as being "on the brink of the abyss".
Correspondent Malcolm Brabant outlines yesterday's Greek violence.
Between 30,000 to 40,000 bees attacked the 77-year-old woman as she walked past their hive near her home in Las Vegas.
Firefighters drove an estimated 200 bees from her body by dousing the woman with water.
Two men were also stung as they tried to rescue the woman.
A fire brigade spokesman said the woman was in shock by the time they arrived and was admitted to hospital, where staff used tweezers and duct tape to pull the stings from her body.
It is thought the bees had been attracted to something in her bag.
The African bees were originally brought to South America from southern Africa in 1956.
This type of bee has killed an estimated 1,000 people on their journey, colonising ever greater areas of Central America, Mexico and California.
To the naked eye, the Africanised bee looks the same as the European honey bee, and individually, their venom is no more potent.
But the Africanised bees' sting in greater numbers, are more easily agitated, and are not intimidated by people.
They are also more defensive in reacting against perceived threats to their hives, and will fly up to a kilometre (half a mile) in pursuit of a target.
The man, said to be in his 40s, is the president of a real estate company who frequently visited the night life area in Tokyo where Miss Blackman, 21, worked as a bar hostess.
Police arrested the man after a Canadian bar hostess alleged she was sexually assaulted by him three years ago.
Reports in Japan say the man's mobile telephone was used to make a call to one of Miss Blackman's friends two days after she went missing on 1 July.
Police are questioning him about the case and searching his properties both in Tokyo and elsewhere.
The former air hostess went missing after spending the day with an unidentified customer from the bar where she worked.
Her family have put up a �10,000 reward for information leading to their daughter's discovery.
Her father, Tim, from the Isle of Wight, has made several trips to Japan to try to find his daughter.
She began working as a highly-paid hostess at the Casablanca Club in Tokyo's Roppongi entertainment district.
She disappeared after telling a friend she was going to meet a man who had promised to buy her a mobile phone.
The friend then said she had received a phone call from a Japanese man who said Lucie was undergoing religious training at a cult.
This raised fears that Miss Blackman might have been initiated into a religious sect.
A later call to a police hotline suggested the 21-year-old, along with four other Westerners, had been abducted and shipped to Hong Kong as part of an illegal sex trade.
Miss Blackman's mother, Jane, who lives apart from Lucie's father, said she was ready to leave for Japan at "a moment's notice".
In separate statements, both of the US giants insisted that the separation was ending amicably for business reasons.
McDonald's rejected a Los Angeles Times report that Disney wished to distance itself from so-called junk food.
The burger giant said the story was "based on Hollywood hearsay" and "a misrepresentation of the truth".
Disney and McDonald's Happy Meal marketing alliance will end after this summer's movies Cars and Pirates of the Caribbean.
"To set the record straight, we have had a very positive relationship with McDonald's for the last 10 years," said Disney in a statement.
According to market estimates, Disney gained $100m (�54m) a year in royalties from McDonald's under the deal.
Analyst Laura Martin of Soleil Media Metrics said health concerns could be part of the thinking for the decision, but that "a bigger determinant to ending a deal is economics".
She suggested that Disney may now be seeking other food partners, and that McDonald's is already tied up with Disney's rival DreamWorks Animation after signing a two year deal last summer.
Obesity is now a growing political issue in the US, home to the highest number of obese people in the world.
It compared results of social attitude polls from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.
This had fallen to 46% of women and 42% of men in 2002, amid "growing sympathy" for the old-fashioned view women should be in the home and not the workplace.
The survey, which questioned between 1,000 and 5,000 people, was conducted by Professor Jacqueline Scott from the university's department of sociology.
She used recent data from the International Social Survey Programme and older polls.
Professor Scott said the idea that support was steadily growing for women taking an equal role in the workplace, rather than their traditional role in the home was "clearly a myth".
Yet, it also showed the numbers of people who believed it was the man's role to work and the wife's to look after the children had fallen.
The survey focuses on results from Britain, the US and, because the earlier surveys pre-dated the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former Federal Republic of Germany.
In the US the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted, from 51% in 1994 to 38% in 2002.
About the same number of West Germans (37%) agree; but the number there has risen, having been just 24% in the mid-1990s.
The report adds there should now be further investigation to understand why the attitude shift is occurring.
It asks whether this is because caring for the family is seen as women's work, or because people feel there is no practical alternative to a woman taking the role.
Prof Scott said a change in attitude was not the same thing as a change in behaviour, but it mattered.
Meanwhile, the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality between women and men in the UK on pay and pensions, said attempts to force women into a male-created workplace were failing.
"The result is that motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are strait-jacketed by gender stereotypes.
This in my view indicates a healthy disrespect for governments in those countries which are governed reasonably well and an understandable lack of trust in those which are not.
Take the two trends together and you have a global picture showing a gap between the governors and the governed.
So what else is new?
What is new these days perhaps is that more people around the world can actually express an honest opinion.
It is obviously an uneasy time for governments worldwide.
Only in Scandinavia, South Africa and Israel did citizens think their countries were governed in line with popular demands.
But, with exceptions, of which al-Qaeda is an example, it is not generally a revolutionary era.
The survey is an annual trawl through world opinion by Gallup International (a not-for-profit associatation registered in Switzerland) called "Voice of the People".
At this time of religious fervour in some parts of the world, it is worth looking at whether religious leaders are trusted and whether people think they should get more power.
It turns out that they come top of the global list of trusted groups, scoring mostly strongly in south-east Asia, Africa and North America.
In south-east Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) the poll suggests they have a high trust rating of 68%, in Africa a huge 74% and in North America a sturdy 49%.
In happily governed Scandinavia by contrast, religious leaders are most trusted by only 12%.
Muslims and Protestants are most likely to trust their religious leaders and to want to give them more power.
However, religious leaders do not come top of the global list of groups which should have more power.
But religion is the most important factor for people in South Asia and parts of Africa.
I was a bit disappointed that journalists were not included in the definition of intellectuals but one has to take comfort that in some parts of the world (west Africa, south-east Asia) journalists are rather admired! Not, however, in the UK - where journalists fall behind even politicians...
Military and police leaders do well in North America and western Europe, very well in orderly Scandinavia and unsurprisingly badly in Latin America and Africa, reflections presumably of the record of military dictatorships in those continents.
In fact, the whole survey is rather unsurprising, nowhere more so than in the finding that it is family which most influences people's decisions.
In that we are all much alike.
The MORI poll suggested that nearly two-thirds of 2,600 school-age children in England and Wales found cancer a greater cause of worry than terrorism and war in Afghanistan.
The survey was commissioned by Cancer Research UK to establish the level of anxiety children felt about the disease.
The charity says the results highlight the need for more cancer information to be made available to school children.
The survey found that as children moved into their later teens their level of anxiety about cancer sharply increased.
Nearly three-quarters (74%) of the 15 to 16-year-old respondents said the disease was more of a concern than terrorism or war in Afghanistan.
The poll also reveals both gender and geographic variations in children's experience of the disease.
Girls are more likely than boys to have known someone with cancer - 46% compared to 36%.
Cancer Research UK says this suggests that relatives may be more inclined to tell girls than boys, or that girls have a greater understanding of cancer than boys.
"Over the next year we are planning to develop a range of web-based resources that will help both students and teachers understand cancer better.
The research was based on 2,660 interviews with children aged 11-16 in England and Wales.
The document does though contain a far more detailed analysis of where the threat has come from, why it has changed and where it may go in the future.
Officials say it is unprecedented to place this much analysis in the public domain.
The strategy argues that al-Qaeda as an organisation is likely to fragment and may not survive in its current form.
However its ideology and the factors that sustain terrorism will persist -leading the threat to mutate, with a greater role for self-starting groups.
Additionally, there are fears that terrorist organisations may have access to new technology and so become capable of conducting more lethal operations.
Terrorist groups have long sought to use unconventional weapons - biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological - but it is now feared that greater availability of technology coupled with problems like theft and smuggling means they are more likely to be able to get their hands on what they have been seeking.
As a result, the focus on dealing with unconventional attacks has been upgraded from the previous strategy (coming closer to the US pre-occupation with this particular danger).
The international context also receives more attention than in the past, with sections on Pakistan and Afghanistan and on the relationship between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency.
This is a clear recognition that since the majority of UK terrorist plotting has some connection to Pakistan, improving co-operation and communication with both the government in Islamabad and the population in Pakistan will be vital to combating terrorism within the UK.
The 2012 Olympics also now looms large in the mind of counter-terrorist officials with an awareness that counter-terrorism is going to have to be integrated in a vast security operation not just in London, but other parts of the country which will be involved in staging aspects of the games.
Making sure that delivery of the strategy filters down to the local level by working with the right people is one recurring theme.
The strategy covers four main areas of work known as 'the Four Ps' - Pursue, Prevent, Protect and Prepare.
There had been speculation that the government might take a more aggressive line in the new strategy, but that does not appear to be the case and the agenda largely seems to have been tweaked with some new projects and a greater focus on the internet.
The union Unite said its workers did not accept the company decision to shut the site near Bristol.
Unite said the factory was "profitable and productive" and there was "widespread anger" in the community.
Workers from the Cadbury's plant at Bournville in Birmingham also took part in Tuesday's protest.
It is thought some 200 people protested.
Staff in Keynsham were told during an emergency meeting last week that the phased closure would begin in 2009 and be finished by 2010.
Cadbury said its other two UK chocolate manufacturing sites, at Chirk in North Wales and Leominster in Herefordshire, would be "unaffected" by the plans.
Dawn Naish, 41, from Barr's Court, Bristol, said her family would be devastated by the closure.
The makers of the series put out the warning after spotting several cases of people pretending to be David Tennant in internet chatrooms and forums.
Others set up fake profiles for the cast, including new Doctor Matt Smith, on social networking sites.
He said neither of the stars used social networking websites, chatrooms or forums.
"They wouldn't want fans to think that anyone who uses these are talking to the real actors," he added.
Controversy has arisen over the al-Samoud Two missile, which has travelled up to 112 miles (180 km) in tests - further than the 93 miles (150 km) permitted under UN rules.
The gorilla, 13-year-old Jabari, fled while the zoo was full of visitors.
In a panic he attacked and injured two women and two children - zoo workers armed with tranquiliser guns pursued him but could not get a clear shot.
He was eventually shot dead by police officers, who said they had no choice as he was trying to charge at them.
"We had to shoot it," Dallas Deputy Police Chief Daniel Garcia told the Associated Press news agency.
Zoo officials say they are puzzled by Jabari's escape as his enclosure is surrounded by a concave wall more than four metres (13 feet) high.
One witness said the western lowland gorilla was banging on the door and broke it down.
Dallas zoo has recently had to cut staffing and maintenance because of financial problems.
However, its officials deny this had anything to do with the gorilla's escape.
Both the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker and Mr Abramovich's representatives said they would not comment on "speculation".
However, the market reacted well to the talk, with Corus's share price closing the day up almost 2% at 398p.
Mr Abramovich is already in talks to take over 40% of Russia's largest steel maker, Evraz.
According to Russian business newspaper Kommersant, a move for Corus could see the Chelsea owner swapping shares between the two firms.
He would secure a key stake in Corus, which would then have access to cheaper materials in Russia, the report said.
The speculation comes a week after the world's biggest steel group, Arcelor, announced a deal to buy Russian firm Severstal, as it tried to fend off a hostile takeover bid from rival Mittal.
A spokesman for Mr Abramovich said he would not comment on "market speculation".
The conservative victory was expected, after thousands of reformist candidates had been barred from standing.
But analysts say the poll has dealt a devastating blow to the reform camp.
Reformists - who held 190 seats in the outgoing parliament - won around 40, with 34 going to independents.
In the run-up to the poll some pro-reform groups had called for a boycott, while supporters of clerical rule urged people to vote.
The outgoing parliament is still supposed to sit for another three months until the inauguration of the new parliament.
But about 120 of its reformist members are going ahead with the resignations they announced in protest at the elections.
Earlier this week the candidate expected to lead the conservative bloc in the new parliament called on the US to recognise the legitimacy of Iran's 25-year-old Islamic revolution.
Washington has criticised last Friday's poll, describing it as neither free nor fair.
Kids' views on deluxe albums
Britney's deluxe version of her album - called Circus - has an added DVD, while Take That's - called The Circus - has a book that goes with it.
But they aren't the only stars releasing two versions of the same album at the moment.
Rihanna and Leona Lewis are both bringing out new versions of the albums they released last year, with extra tracks and content.
So what do you think of deluxe albums? Are they a good deal for fans, because they get even more from their fave artists, or are they a rip-off?

The 35-year-old has signed a one-year deal at the Blue Square Premier outfit, with the option of a second year.
Crawley have also signed defenders Sam Rents and Chris Giles, recently released by Brighton and Forest Green.
"Each one of these lads will play a big part next season," boss Steve Evans told BBC Southern Counties Radio.
Fletcher turned down a new contract with League Two side Chesterfield to move closer to his Bournemouth home.
The 26-year-old Czech Republic driver's agent, Antonin Charouz, confirmed the nature of the substance on Friday.
Enge, who lies in second place in the Formula 3000 drivers' championship, maintains his innocence.
"Tomas could have breathed it in at a disco," said Charouz.
Enge, who drove three races for the now defunct Prost team in 2001, has been summoned to appear before the next meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 1 October.
Charouz and team principal Christian Horner both insisted Enge will race this weekend.
"Tomas will take part in the F3000 race in Monza but his result will be unofficial," said Charouz.
Enge is one point behind Formula 3000 leader Sebastien Bourdais of France heading into the final race of the season at Monza.
If he snatches the drivers' crown on Saturday then the result will be provisional until the World Council hearing next month.
The Arden International driver can request a re-test of the originalsample.
The suspension follows an incident during Bristol's Zurich Premiership meeting with London Irish last month.
Salter, a former rugby league player with the London Broncos, was cited for a charge of "serious foul play" for which he pleaded guilty.
Although the match officials did not see the incident during Bristol's 30-26 defeat at the Memorial Ground, the flanker was found guilty of striking an opponent with his forearm.
The suspension will further weaken a struggling Bristol side, currently languishing second-from-bottom in the Zurich Premiership.
Salter was accompanied to the hearing by Bristol coach Dean Ryan, who believed the overall result was fair.
Salter will now miss Bristol's opening four European Shield matches against Parma (twice), Mont-de-Marsan and La Rochelle.
From 5-3 down in the Auckland semi-final, Keothavong won the first set on a tie-break with a scorching backhand.
Vesnina hit back in style, however, winning the next set 6-1 in 39 minutes.
A fortuitous net cord saw Vesnina break in the decider, and despite spurning four match points, she secured a place in the final against Elena Dementieva.
Keothavong was incensed by a contentious line call that went against her and led to the first break of the final set, in the seventh game.
After remonstrating angrily with the umpire, the Briton recovered back to 5-5 on serve, but then suffered the misfortune of Vesnina's forehand dropping the right side of the net.
She saved two match points when Vesnina served at 6-5, and 22-year-old Vesnina then had to save two break points of her own before she sealed victory with an ace in the match that lasted just under three hours.
"I'm obviously really disappointed about today's result but I'm not going to beat myself up about it," Keothavong told her website.
"It was a big match for both of us for a place in the final and I guess there were a lot of nerves out there and I got quite emotional because I wanted it badly.
Top seed Dementieva earlier wasted little time in defeating last year's finalist Aravane Rezai of France 6-2 6-2 in just 66 minutes.
It is only the second time she will have faced compatriot and doubles partner Vesnina.
Corruption is widespread and Paraguay is a centre for smuggling, money laundering and organised crime.
The triple border region, where Paraguay touches both Argentina and Brazil, has long been associated with drug-smuggling and other contraband trade.
It is also home to a large Middle Eastern community, and the United States has identified it as a source of funding for Islamic militant groups - though Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay reject that allegation.
The commercialisation of agriculture, population growth and forest clearances have led to a dramatic increase in the number of landless families.
Vice-President Federico Franco assumed the presidency in June 2012, when Congress controversially impeached left-wing President Fernando Lugo over his handling of a land eviction that left 17 people dead.
Mr Lugo complained that the impeachment had failed to give him enough time to present his case, and was tantamount to a coup.
Mr Franco, a leading member of Paraguay's main opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party, had agreed to run as Mr Lugo's vice-president in 2008 in order to help end 61 decades of rule by the conservative Colorado Party.
Born in 1962 and a surgeon by profession, Mr Franco entered politics and became governor of the important Central Department in 2003 before joining Mr Lugo's presidential bid in 2008.
He is expected to serve out the rest of Mr Lugo's term in office, which ends in August 2013.
Fernando Lugo had stepped down as Roman Catholic bishop in 2006 to enter politics on a manifesto of tackling inequality and corruption.
On taking office in August 2008, he vowed to deliver on land reform - a key issue in a predominantly agrarian economy.
But his party, the Patriotic Alliance for Change (APC) and its allies were unable to overcome opposition from the Colorado Party, which remained powerful in Congress.
His presidency was overshadowed by paternity scandals and a cancer diagnosis.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the media rights body, said in 2007 that journalists "do not dare probe too deeply into scandals involving politicians".
Unlicensed radio stations have flourished in the tri-border area, where the frontiers of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet.
The organisers say up to 400,000 people have taken part, but that figure has not yet been confirmed by the authorities.
Many demonstrators are angry at new national security legislation - due to be introduced next week - which they say is a threat to political, religious and media freedoms.
But a whole range of issues were being protested against, from the dire state of the territory's economy, to the government's handling of the deadly Sars virus.
The protest overshadowed the official celebrations to mark the sixth anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese control, presided over by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
One group of protesters burned the Chinese Communist Party flag as Mr Wen desperately tried to reassure reporters that Article 23 would not infringe on the considerable autonomy the territory has been promised.
It "absolutely will not affect the different rights and freedoms that Hong Kong people - including reporters - enjoy under the law", Mr Wen said.
Mr Wen left Hong Kong before the organised protest started.
"Return rule to the people," chanted protesters dressed in black to mourn what they said was the demise of rights and freedoms in the once free-wheeling territory.
Many groups were represented, with members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in their distinctive yellow T-shirts and Christian groups strumming guitars.
"The government is trying to use the law to suppresspeople's views and voices," lawyer Terry Chan told Reuters news agency.
"This will push Hong Kong toward an era of tyranny,"said WC Mak, a 74-year-old retired nurse.
Our correspondent, who was with the demonstrators, says that although the atmosphere was peaceful, there was no mistaking the strength of feeling.
The controversial bill - Article 23 - is due to be signed into law next week.
But Britain and the European Union have also criticised the bill, saying it could compromise the territory's autonomy from mainland China.
Hong Kong officials reject the criticism.
"The fear that freedoms will be threatened are actually totally unfounded," Hong Kong's Security Secretary Regina Ip told the BBC's World Today programme.
At the anniversary celebrations earlier on Tuesday, Mr Wen watched as the five-starred Chinese national flag and the red Bauhinia flower flag of Hong Kong were raised.
Helicopters swirled overhead and patrol boats sprayed jets of water in what was a deliberate echo of the ceremony in 1997, when Britain's union flag was finally lowered.
Mr Wen then left for Beijing, where he was due to take part in celebrations marking the 82nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.
Officials said five children were taken to hospital in a critical condition after the incident in Jiangsu province.
It follows a knife attack on Wednesday in the south of the country, in which 16 pupils and one teacher were injured.
Earlier that day, a doctor convicted of stabbing eight children to death in Fujian province in March was executed.
The alleged assailant in Jiangsu was named by police as Xu Yuyuan, a 47-year-old unemployed local man.
Reports say he attacked the children at the Zhongzin pre-school in Taixing city as lessons began in the morning, stabbing a security guard who tried to stop him.
Police said Mr Xu, who was detained shortly afterwards, was carrying a 20cm (8in) knife, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
An official named Zhu told AFP the critically-injured children were now in a stable condition.
Most of the injured children were reported to be four-year-olds from the same class.
"The injured have been sent here one after another," an unnamed official at the Taixing No 1 People's hospital told the Associated Press news agency.
China has witnessed several school attacks in recent years, most blamed on people with personal grudges or suffering from mental illness.
On Wednesday, at least 15 students and one teacher were injured in a knife attack at a primary school in southern Guangdong province.
Chen Kangbing, 30, was a teacher at the school in Leizhou city but had been on sick leave since 2006, state media reported.
He attempted to throw himself from the roof of the school before he was arrested, said the city's public security chief, Qin Zhucai.
The same day, 42-year-old Zheng Minsheng was executed in eastern Fujian province for stabbing to death eight children in Nanping.
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Shanghai says the attacks are unsettling in a country where such violent attacks are rare.
Since a spate of attacks in 2004, many schools in China have employed professional guards but the latest incidents have led to public calls for increased security in schools.
China Daily says the education ministry ordered all schools to upgrade their security facilities earlier this month and employ guards.
Schools were also ordered to teach students about safety and ensure young children were escorted home, said the report.
But such measures are expensive, says our correspondent, and in reality there is little that can be done to prevent such acts of violence.
The incidents have also sparked a debate about the motives of the killers, with some suggesting that rapid social change and growing unemployment has led to an increase in psychiatric illnesses.
They found that people with a positive outlook live, on average, 19% longer than those who are miserable.
By looking at the patients 30 years later, the researchers discovered that those who had been classified as optimists had a 19% higher chance of still being alive than the pessimists, reports the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
But he and his team could not say if this was due to happy people's immune systems being stronger directly because of their optimism.
The other option was that they were more likely to seek medical help when they become ill, they said.
Optimists were less likely to suffer depression and helplessness and were less fatalistic about their health chances.
Pessimism was identifiable early and could be stabilised by therapy which changed the individual's thinking about bad events, he said.
He said the results of the Mayo Clinic research could be down to the common phenomenon of old people giving up hope when things went wrong in their lives, hastening death.
The wildlife trade organisation Traffic has documented a five-fold increase in the volume of rhino horn entering the illegal market between 2000 and 2005.
The populations most affected are in western and central Africa and Nepal, with one sub-species in Cameroon believed extinct already.
However, overall, rhinos are doing well with Africa-wide numbers increasing by about 6% every year.
The Traffic report was released at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) summit in The Hague.
"We are seeing an increase in the quantity of horn which is leaving the continent," said Simon Milledge, Traffic's deputy director for eastern and southern Africa.
In the middle of the 1800s, there were probably more than a million black and white rhinos on the plains of Africa.
Rapacious hunting by European settlers brought numbers down spectacularly, and at one point the southern white was thought extinct.
Protective measures brought a reversal for both species, and in southern and eastern Africa, the revival continues, with countries such as Namibia and South Africa having found a new use for their rhinos as a tourist attraction.
The Traffic report names Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe as countries where protective measures have broken down.
Asian rhinos, meanwhile, show a mixed picture.
"The Sumatran and Javan rhinos are very vulnerable," noted Simon Milledge.
A Kenyan amendment that stockpiles should be destroyed was defeated.
Traffic is a joint programme of the conservation group WWF and the IUCN, which is famous for drawing up the Red Lists that document the status of the planet's flora and fauna.
It was the most fleeting of glimpses, but still enough to raise a smile on the face of eight-year-old Christopher Eaton.
The young royal admirer had travelled from Liverpool with his family to take in this extended weekend of Jubilee celebrations in London.
So Christopher, his mother Anne and grandmother Ronnie made the best of their circumstances.
Standing on a park bench in the courtyard of St Bride's Church, they strained to see over the heads of fellow onlookers and through the windows of a coffee shop that stood between them and the route of the parade.
"This is about the best place we've found," said Anne.
"I saw the coach but I didn't see the Queen," said Christopher, who never-the-less sported a wide grin of content.
"We'll see her later, when we go down to the palace," his mother chipped in.
The Eatons were one of many thousands of families who had turned out to witness the grand display of pageantry as it passed through the centre of the capital.
The crowd that lined the Mall reached 12-people deep by the time the procession set off from Buckingham Palace.
Many had set their alarms early to secure front-row places behind the railings.
Recently the Mall has been no stranger to pomp and ceremony - it was a focus for some of the state events that following the death of the Queen Mother in March.
But whereas those events were inevitably tinged with sorrow, the atmosphere on Tuesday morning was one of unbridled celebration.
Many were looking forward to witnessing first hand the Queen's gold state coach.
Measuring 24 feet in length and weighing some four tonnes, the ornately carved coach, which was commissioned by George III in 1760, is a spectacle in itself.
Eight specially trained horses are required to pull it, together with a driving crew of 13 men.
The coach was preceded by a vanguard of several less-grandiose horse-drawn carriages, carrying the likes of Princes William and Harry, the Duke of York, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex.
But the biggest cheers were held back for the Queen herself.
As she and Prince Philip glided past, they were greeted by the crowd with whoops and shouts of delight.
Handheld Union Flags were raised and fluttered in a Mexican-wave-style ripple that marked the passing of the coach.
But her admirers spanned the age spectrum.
Vera Morgan, 80, had travelled from Worthing, in West Sussex, to cheer on the procession with her friend Sybil Frostick.
A former Women's Royal Air Force volunteer, Vera has always been a loyal admirer of the monarchy.
On Monday night, parents Diane and Kevin Pearce from Torquay in Devon had enjoyed the Buckingham Palace pop concert with their daughter Kirstin, 12.
They had planned a week's holiday in London around the Jubilee celebrations and were on the Mall to see the procession in all its splendour.
"It's something we are not going to see again for another 25 years, so we've come to make the best of it," added Kevin.
Although the procession had passed, they were planning to stick around for the day to enjoy the carnival celebrations that will represent the climax of the Jubilee festivities.
The bishops of Durham, Winchester, Hulme, Manchester and Carlisle told the Sunday Telegraph the UK was beset by family breakdown, debt and poverty.
Bishop of Manchester the Rt Rev Nigel McCulloch said Labour was "beguiled by money" and "morally corrupt".
But Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell, who represents the Church in the Commons, said the comments were "nonsense".
Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Bishop of Durham the Rt Rev Tom Wright accused ministers of making promises that had later "vanished into thin air".
In a separate interview with the paper, Bishop McCulloch echoed those criticisms, just days after he used his Christmas Day sermon to warn that society was facing an inevitable come-uppance for its "buy now, pay later" culture.
The Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, the Church's Bishop for Urban Life and Faith, said he feared Britain would simply return to a "financial system based on indebtedness" after the current crisis.
"The government isn't telling people who are already deep in debt to stop overextending themselves, but instead is urging us to spend more," he said.
Bishop Lowe, who is bishop of Hulme within the diocese of Manchester, later told the BBC he wanted to see an end to "the notion of greed, of getting something you want immediately using the credit card".
Meanwhile, the Bishops of Carlisle and Winchester claimed ministers had squandered their opportunity to transform society.
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said while it was not the first time the Church and state have clashed in recent times, the bishops' language was "particularly robust".
Only last week, the Archbishop of Canterbury launched a public attack on the government.
Dr Rowan Williams said Gordon Brown's plans to spend more in order to tackle the recession were like an "addict returning to the drug", and suggested the economy had been going in the wrong direction for decades.
Sir Stuart Bell MP, who is the Second Church Estates Commissioner and the Church's representative in the Commons branded the criticism as "nonsense".
Sir Stuart added that it "ill-behoved" those who lived in "bishops' palaces" to condemn government policies aiming at alleviating poverty.
But Labour MP John McFall told the BBC he believed there was "a kernel of truth" in the bishops' remarks.
"It's important for people to look at this in a moral dimension - right and wrong - and to ensure that we bring back some of the responsibility that was evident many, many years ago when people had to save up for things," he said.
The tree is Britain, after all.
Boscobel oak, where Charles II hid from Cromwell's army after the battle of Worcester.
Even now, Fisher warned, with missionary passion, the gentry were squandering the future by leaving woodlands to be destroyed by animals protected for the hunt, frittering away the birthright of future Britons so they might fund their passions for "horses and dogs, wine and women, cards and folly".
Certain very old trees whose huge but blasted trunks still sprouted a bit of greenery, like the Greendale Oak and the Cowthorpe Oak, were adopted as vegetable patriarchs of the British tradition and became popular sights for patriotic tourists.
Tell me you can run your hands over the rough bark and deep furrows of an oak trunk, or set the tongue-like leaves in your hand and not feel something of our history and I won't believe you.

Tim Montgomerie describes the CS spray attack
The scuffle involved two guests at a spring drinks reception for the media in the shadow cabinet room, hosted by Conservative chairman Eric Pickles.
The guests left the event but continued arguing and were stopped in the corridor by a police officer.
The man was arrested and taken to a nearby police station for questioning and later released on bail.
Conservative Party chairman Eric Pickles had light-heartedly lectured his 40 or so guests crammed into the shadow cabinet room in the Commons on the dangers of binge drinking.
The guests came from across the political spectrum - a Morning Star journalist here, a socially conservative broadsheet columnist there.
Some of the guests at the event told the BBC they thought it was an over-reaction but Commons sources said a police officer received minor injuries in the incident.
"One of the men became aggressive and allegedly punched the officer in the face - he sustained a split/cut lip.
The man, who has not been named, was released on bail until 7 July pending further inquiries.
Commons authorities confirmed the incident had not been terrorist related or linked to the G20 meeting of world leaders in London later this week.
It is understood that the incident happened in the corridor behind the Speaker's chair, at the same time as MPs were debating Africa.
Sources said parliamentary sittings had not been disrupted.
The incident, involving two people who did not have House of Commons passes, will raise fresh questions about security at Westminster.
Parliamentary security has been breached on several occasions in recent years, notably when pro-hunting supporters invaded the Commons chamber in 2004.
Last year protesters from the Plane Stupid campaign group scaled the roof of Parliament to demonstrate against new airport runways.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission went to court in an attempt to gain unprecedented access to all documents relating to the case.
It has been considering allegations by Thomas TC Campbell, 47, and Joe Steele, 38, that they were wrongfully convicted.
The men were found guilty of murdering six members of the Doyle family, including an 18-month-old child, by starting a fire in a tenement flat in Ruchazie, Glasgow, in April 1984.
Numerous requests have been made to the Crown Office for access to papers since May last year.
Scotland's senior law officer, the lord advocate, opposed the documents being handed over.
But on Tuesday Lord Clarke ruled in favour of the commission, saying that there was nothing in principle which prevented it from seeking the papers.
The commission could refer the case back to the appeal court if it believes a miscarriage of justice took place.
Campbell and Steele were jailed for life after being convicted of murder 16 years ago after a 27-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow.
The killings were part of a violent war between ice cream van businesses in the east end of Glasgow.
The men lost an appeal, then an attempt to have fresh evidence heard was rejected on a split decision of three judges in 1998 after the then Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, referred the case to the appeal court.
Their case has been under consideration by the review commission, which was set up to adjudicate on whether alleged miscarriages of justice should be referred back to appeal court judges.
The High Court in Edinburgh had earlier heard that after Campbell and Steele lost their last appeal their solicitors raised a new challenge with the Scottish secretary, which was handed over to the commission when it was set up.
The commission received some material from the Crown Office, but went to court seeking access to all documents relating to the case.
That move was opposed by the Crown.

The 28-year-old took just 32 seconds to defeat the previously unbeaten New Zealander Kali Meehan at Bethnal Green.
He is due to take on Julius Francis, who was most memorably beaten by Mike Tyson, in his next bout, but is already angling for a clash with Harrison.
Francis held both titles when he beat Williams in April 1999 and the man who lasted just 243 seconds against Tyson nine months later was far from impressed by Saturday's action.
"I know Danny wanted to show me and the public what he could do, but there was nothing I had not seen before and there was nothing I had not expected from him," Francis said.
Meehan, whose 23-fight unbeaten record earned him a crack at Williams'Commonwealth crown, did not land a punch.
The Home Office turned down Charlton's request at a hearing on Tuesday after Bolanos failed to meet the requirement of appearances for his country.
"Christian is an emerging talent and is a fixture in the Costa Rica side though he's only 22, so it's disappointing for us and for him," said boss Iain Dowie.
Bolanos had agreed a loan deal from Deportivo Saprissa.
Bolanos was in his country's squad for the 2006 World Cup and was signed for the Addicks after impressing during a trial spell with the club.
Neither man was on target in the 2-0 win over Norwich at the Ricoh Arena on Saturday however McKenzie did notch up his 100th career goal.
Profits at the world's second largest personal computer maker fell to $67m compared to $338m in the same period a year ago.
Including a special restructuring charge of $439m, the firm ran up losses of $279m during the three months.
A slowdown-provoked slump in demand has been the root of the computer maker's troubles.
Earlier this month, Compaq sent a tremor through the stock markets after cutting its sales forecasts and axing a further 4,000 workers.
The company also stressed that it would retreat from the front line of PC sales after suffering from intense price competition from its rival Dell.
Compaq now plans to refocus its business on software and computer services.
Worldwide personal computer sales fell for the first time in 15 years during the third quarter, according to research firm Gartner Dataquest.
And Compaq noted that European PC sales have now begun to mirror the decline seen in the US.
But the company also said that the situation in the US had begun to stabilise.
Compaq's troubles cannot solely be attributed to the slowdown.
Its rival Dell has steadily been gaining market share, overtaking Compaq as the world's most popular personal computer maker earlier this year.
"In the short-term, the market remains volatile and thus difficult to predict with much certainty," said the company's chief executive and chairman Michael Capellas.
Shares of Compaq were actively traded after hours but remained roughly steady at about $14, since results were similar to expectations.
The Georgian Airways flight took off from the Georgian capital Tbilisi and landed in Moscow two hours later.
Russia has given permission for three more charter flights over the next few days, said a Georgian Airways spokesman.
But Moscow has not yet permitted a timetable of scheduled flights.
The move is the latest thaw in ties that had been frozen since a five-day war in August 2008, when Georgia attempted to regain control of South Ossetia, whose separatist forces were backed by Russian troops.
In December, the countries announced that a key road crossing closed since 2006 was to be reopened.
The Kazbegi-Upper Lars crossing, which officials said was likely to reopen in March, is the only crossing that does not go through the Russian-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Georgian forces were driven out of the two regions in the bitter war.
Correspondents say the recent signs of improving relations between Georgia and Russia are significant, but that the hostility between the two countries remains strong.
One of the rockets, which are bigger than the makeshift Qassam missiles militants usually launch, fell near a kibbutz in southern Israel.
There was no damage or casualties reported at the Itfah kibbutz.
Earlier in the day, as Israel voted in a general election, two Arab Israeli shepherds were killed in a blast caused by an unexploded shell in a field.
Katyushas, a favoured weapon of the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, have a range several times greater than Qassams, which have caused few Israeli casualties in hundreds of salvoes.
An Israeli TV commentator said their deployment would be a "dramatic development", which Israel's military had long feared.
The Israeli town of Ashkelon - with more than 100,000 inhabitants and the site of important desalination and power facilities - lies within striking distance of Katyusha rockets.
The Arab shepherds - a father and his teenage son - died on Tuesday morning in a blast near Nahal Oz farming community just a few hundred metres east of the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli army said the explosion might have been caused by a rocket that had lain dormant for some time.
However, the army did confirm that three rockets had been fired from Gaza during the day.
The dead were Bedouin Arabs, who make up about 10% of Israel's Arab community, which itself represents about one-fifth of Israel's total population.
In other violence, Israeli troops killed one Palestinian militant in a raid in the West Bank.
Samer Freihat, 24, was hit by an Israeli bullet after clashes broke out in the village of Yamun, near Jenin, Palestinian medics said.
Palestinian radio said he was shot several times and left to bleed for several hours before he died.
An Israeli army spokesman said troops had opened fire after seeing Freihat was armed, adding that he had been on a list of wanted militants.
Xing Xu and colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing found their tyrannosauroid in the famous fossil beds of Liaoning Province.
Xu told Nature magazine the discovery would help us understand how some early dinosaurs controlled their body heat.
The researchers found a partial skeleton with a nearly complete skull, together with fragments from other individuals.
The team describes the animal as "small and gracile" with "relatively long arms with three-fingered hands".
The dinosaur is said to show the distinctively square-snouted profile of its much larger and more famous Late Cretaceous (70-65-million-year-old) cousin.
Evidence of hair-like "protofeathers" was located on the tail and jaw of the animal.
The team includes co-workers from the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and the Museum of Natural History, Tianjin.
Before France's epic 43-31 semi-final destruction of the All Blacks, the side had been struggling through the worst year in its history.
The French only progressed to the last eight courtesy of the easiest draw among the top sides and were written off as no-hopers against New Zealand.
Few believed they would manage to repeat that upset against the Australians but Skrela said despite the 35-12 scoreline, he was not despondent.
"We were put under pressure and forced into lots of little mistakes.
French skipper Raphael Ibanez was devastated by his team's comprehensive defeat, but was quick to pay tribute to Australia.
"The Australians performed better than we did on the day and I wantto say a big bravo to them.
"But I must also congratulate the French players for what they achieved bygetting to the final.
Ibinez said France's victory over the New Zealand All Blacks took a lot out of his team.
"Everyone did the best they could but the Australians are used to playing at this level and that proved the difference.
The Bluewater retail park, near Dartford in Kent, claims to be the largest shopping and leisure centre in Europe - bigger than the nearby Lakeside Centre in Thurrock, Essex.
It contains three malls, which will offer more than 320 stores and nearly 40 bars and restaurants.
It is designed to attract 30 million shoppers a year from all over the south-east.
In particular, Bluewater's managers want to compete with the West End of London.
Bluewater's "guests" - as it calls its customers - will be able to eat in a five-star restaurant operated by Hediard, the Paris equivalent of Fortnum and Mason.
Bluewater will be the last major out-of-town shopping centre in England - one or two more are still expected in Scotland.
Some out-of-town developments are still in the pipeline - proposed before the government changed the rules - but may never be built.
"The international railway station will be no more than 5km from here, and a new housing and community will complement the regeneration programme," she said.
But John Alexander, of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, said the place would be "hell on earth".
In the longer term, the 13 million people living within a one-hour drive of both centres should ensure that neither becomes like the "ghost malls" seen when neighbouring rivals slug it out in the United States.
Green-belt restrictions prevent development along much of the rest of the M25 corridor, so if local shoppers do not want to trek into London, they will have to choose between one of the two malls.
Crowds in Stratford-upon-Avon can enjoy street theatre, dancing, plays and music over the weekend marking his birth - believed to be 23 April, 1564.
Hundreds of people, including some wearing Elizabethan costumes, took part in the traditional procession on Saturday.
Floral tributes were laid on the writer's grave at Holy Trinity Church.

Catatania, Stereophonics and the Manic Street Preachers are more famous than any male voice choir ever was, and even Catherine Zeta-Jones has finally made it off British TV screens and into Hollywood.
But leading the global charge of Welsh cool is Sws, a fashionable social club which means 'kiss' in Welsh and stands for Social, Welsh and Sexy.
The club began in London four years ago in the fashionable Groucho Club in Soho, as a small party of 70 trendy pals.
Now it boasts a membership of 1,200 Welsh glitterati - mainly high-flyers from the world of arts, media and politics - who meet in London for monthly parties.
"When I first came here I noticed that all my friends had sort of disappeared and faded into the background," he said.
The club says you don't have to be Welsh or even sexy to join, just interested in Welshness.
It even welcomes those who perhaps sound very English but want to come out of the closet as a Cool Cymru.
"I don't sound like the archetypal Welshman but I've been brought up to believe myself very Welsh," said interior designer Lawrence Llewellyn-Bowen.
But most A-list of all is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is now heading the charge of Cool Cymru across the Atlantic.
And you can't get much cooler than that.
The Schools Minister, Estelle Morris, said The London Welsh School - or Ysgol Gymraeg Llundain - could not receive funding because it does not teach the national curriculum.
The school has to leave its current home at the end of this term and is appealing for extra funds.
It has had to rely on occasional grants and parental support because it does not follow the English national curriculum and consequently cannot get state aid.
The school and its 17 full-time and 13 part-time pupils is currently looking for a new home as it has to leave its current site at the end of the term because its building has been sold.
Governors are trying to get voluntary-aided status but that would mean having to teach English in Key Stage One of the national curriculum.
But this, MPs say, would defeat the purpose of the school's existence.
The school dates back to 1955 when Welsh language classes were started by two members of the London Welsh Association.
Within two years, it had been decided to extend the lessons by setting up a dedicated Welsh school.
By 1961, the school was set up at St David's Church in Paddington, west London, before it moved to its current site at the Welsh Chapel in Willesden, north west London.
In a bid to secure the school's future on a third London site, the Cardiff North MP Julie Morgan, had appealed to the Commons for funding.
Liverpool's hopes of Champions League progress suffered another body blow as they were held by Basle at Anfield.
Gerard Houllier's side - beaten comprehensively by Valencia in their opening game - needed victory against Christian Gross's Swiss champions to get their campaign on course.
And they looked to be on their way when Milan Baros continued his hot streak by putting Liverpool ahead in the first half.
But Basle then delivered a stunning sucker punch to equalise through Julio Hernan Rossi in almost their first attack just before half time.
Liverpool were denied by a combination of the woodwork and brilliant goalkeeping from Pascal Zuberbuhler in a rousing opening period - but ultimately ran out of ideas.
The Merseysiders now face an uphill struggle to ensure qualification for the second phase after a disappointing opening to their Champions League quest.
Zuberbuhler set the tone for his heroics in the opening seconds by turning John Arne Riise's drive on to the bar.
And he delivered a carbon copy to deny the Norwegian again after nine minutes as Liverpool went in search of glory on Anfield's 100th night of European football.
Basle were penned in their own penalty are, but survived on good fortune alone until Liverpool deservedly broke the deadlock after 33 minutes.
Baros has been a revelation this season, and it was no surprise that he was the scorer with an instinctive right-foot finish from Emile Heskey's pass.
The Czech youngster almost added a second six minutes before the interval, only for Zuberbuhler to produce another flying save.
Basle, who had barely been seen in Liverpool's half, then cashed in on their luck to strike with a deadly counter-punch after 41 minutes.
Jamie Carragher's misjudgement let in Rossi, who scored from close range through Jerzy Dudek's legs.
There was still time for the woodwork to come to Basle's rescue again before half-time as Baros' shot on the turn rebounded to safety.
Basle settled after the break and won more possession, but Liverpool still looked the more likely side to add to the goals tally.
Cameroon defender Timothee Atouba blocked bravely to deny Baros when a goal looked certain.
And Zuberbuhler was tormenting Liverpool again with 19 minutes left when El Hadji Diouf - on as substitute for Emile Heskey - tried his luck from 20 yards.
It had been another blank night for Owen, and he was eventually withdrawn by boss Houllier after 78 minutes when he was replaced by Patrik Berger.
The 95 residents of Britain's first "green" island, Eigg, are being asked not to use kettles, toasters or other kitchen appliances after uncharacteristically mild weather caused a critical shortage of power.
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also insisted Microsoft must reveal secrets of its Windows software, which sits on 90% of the world's PCs.
The European Commission approved Microsoft's punishment on Wednesday.
Microsoft has already said it will appeal, kicking off a legal battle that could last years.
Mr Monti said he was confident "that we have produced here a decision that will stand before any appeal".
Microsoft has a cash pile of more than $50bn, so even a fine on this scale - a record for the EU against a single firm in an antitrust case - is unlikely to hurt it commercially.
Industry experts say that the non-financial penalties are likely to hurt Microsoft more by opening it to further challenges and altering the regulatory environment it operates in.
Microsoft must offer a stripped-down version of its Windows operating system minus the firm's MediaPlayer audiovisual software within 90 days.
Microsoft will still be allowed to sell Windows with Media Player bundled in.
Rivals including Realnetworks welcomed the move, saying that at long last the playing field had been levelled.
Dave Stewart, one of Realnetworks' lawyers, said in an interview with Reuters that the ruling probably will allow the company to increase its market share.
Announcing the penalties, Mr Monti said they restored the conditions for fair competition in the software market.
By setting limits on Microsoft's practice of bundling software and services with its Windows operating system, Mr Monti has struck a blow against a key part of the software firm's commercial strategy.
Mr Monti's demand for a more transparent Windows proved the sticking point in failed talks between Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and Mr Monti last week.
The five-year-old EU case was launched after complaints from rival makers of audiovisual software that Microsoft was protecting its own media player and squeezing out others.
Mr Monti said Brussels' decision did not break new legal ground in either Europe or the US, nor did it expropriate Microsoft's intellectual property.
"Our decision is about protecting consumer choice and stimulating innovation", he told a news conference.
Microsoft claims that it should not be fined at all because it did not know its behaviour would breach EU law.
Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said the firm believed the settlement it proposed last week, which would have let it offer rival products alongside its own, "would have been better for European consumers".
The software giant said it would continue to co-operate with the EU but would seek a legal review of the Commission's decision.
The appeal is expected to begin in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg but the legal battle could go to the European Court of Justice.
As amazement turned to sheer delight, many paid tribute to the bid's architect, Franz Beckenbauer, seen as the single most important factor in bringing the World Cup to a reunited Germany for the first time.
The former footballer and national team manager, who played in the last World Cup hosted by Germany in 1974, said bringing the tournament back was "probably my greatest moment".
"As player or as coach you can in theory compete at a World Cup every four years," said Beckenbauer.
"But to bring the World Cup to your country and to organise it, you get that chance only once in your lifetime.
His key role was praised by many Germans, including government ministers, who believe the bid would not otherwise have succeeded.
Rudi Voeller, the new coach of the German national team, said the decision was very important for German soccer.
President Johannes Rau said he and the nation's soccer-lovers were "enormously happy" about the decision.
"It is the news that we all wished for Germany and German soccer," he said.
Celebrations have been particularly enthusiastic in the 16 German cities which have been shortlisted as venues for the World Cup matches.
Berlin is expected to host the final, and Munich the opening game.
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said Berliners were "proud and happy," and promised that the renovation of the city's historic Olympic stadiumwould be finished in time for the tournament.
Winning the right to stage the World Cup may also, in some measure, make up for Germany's disappointing performance in Euro 2000.
Now it has another six years in which to put together a winning team.

Hutchinson is continuing his rehabilitation from two separate cruciate ligament injuries.
The state-owned carrier added that losses for the year to November stood at 197m euros.
Prospective buyers have until later on Monday to table an offer.
Among those believed to be eyeing the group are US buyout firm Texas Pacific, while reports suggest rival Italian airline Air One could make an offer.
Alitalia is required to update the market about its finances on a monthly basis as market regulators have put it on a "blacklist" of financially weak firms.
The airline blamed a range of factors - including strikes, tough competition and high fuel prices - for its losses.
However, despite warning it will head deeper into the red, the group said it had enough money to remain in business for "well beyond 12 months".
Alitalia, which has suffered from frequent strikes and over-staffing, has not made an annual profit since 2002.
The government is seeking to dilute its existing stake in the struggling carrier from 49% to 19%, and has not ruled out selling all of its shares.
If 30% or more of the government's stake is sold to a single bidder, the purchaser would be obliged to make a full bid for the company.
His grip on power was much weaker than previously thought, and Georgians will be happy that his regime collapsed without bloodshed.
Georgia's President, Mikhail Saakashvili, says the "true revival" of his country can now begin.
Ajaria was his first real trial since becoming president, and he is clearly emboldened by the ease with which Mr Abashidze's rule was ended.
There is great pressure on him now to resolve the disputes with two other regions of Georgia - Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Abkhazia represents the biggest potential danger.
Located in north-western Georgia, on the Black Sea coast, Abkhazia was famous for its citrus fruit and was home to holiday resorts in Soviet times.
Abkhazia's war of independence in 1992-1994 - fought with Russian support - saw the entire Georgian population expelled.
The leadership in Abkhazia refuses to recognise Mr Saakashvili's authority, and has already warned him not to try repeating the 'Ajaria scenario'.
South Ossetia is less strategically important.
A small, landlocked region north of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, it fought a war for reunion with North Ossetia (part of Russia) at the end of 1991.
Its leader, Eduard Kokoity, says he wants an admission of "genocide" from the Georgian leader before they can even meet.
Russia views Georgia as being part of its 'natural sphere of influence'.
So Georgians will have been relieved by Moscow's apparent decision not to intervene during the Ajaria crisis.
Despite previously having close links with Mr Abashidze, Moscow made no efforts to keep him in power.
That is a sure sign of how much Georgia's relations with Russia have improved since Mr Saakashvili came to power.
But if the Georgian leadership now wants to tackle Abkhazia, it might face a very different situation.
Many Georgians want the region re-taken by force, and some key officials have already said Ajaria was just the "first step".
In the event of a Georgian assault on Abkhazia, it seems very unlikely that Russia would remain passive.
That makes it very different from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where the main issue is ethnicity.
Although clearly elated over Ajaria, Georgia's leadership also faces many other, formidable problems.
They include a disastrous economic situation, crime and corruption - and the country's potential attractiveness to international terrorism.
Experts made the prediction after studying thousands of deaths in Hong Kong.
One third of all the cigarettes produced in the world are now smoked in China.
It is thought that the Chinese government is the biggest cigarette manufacturer in the world.
The researchers estimate that if Chinese men continue their habit, 100 million are likely to die because of their smoking.
Half of those will die between the ages of 35 and 65.
The team of scientists based their study on the city of Hong Kong, because it developed ahead of the rest of China and so is an ideal place to predict how changes will affect the mainland.
Smoking in the territory peaked in the 1970s, but - in common with elsewhere in the developed world - death rates peaked 20 years later.
The team from the University of Hong Kong and Oxford University investigated every mortality in 1998.
One-third of all the deaths among middle-aged men was attributed to smoking.
If the trend is mirrored in China, half of an estimated 200 million men who smoke could die from tobacco-related diseases in the next three decades.
The results appear to confirm a much larger research project carried out by the Oxford team in China three years ago.
The scientists believe the only way to tackle the problem is to encourage people to quit.
However, smoking rates are still climbing, and no one knows when they will peak.
Smoking is far more common among men than women in China.
The research is published in the British Medical Journal.
The British Medical Association says the computer-based Summary Care Records are being set up at "break-neck speed", sometimes without patients' knowledge.
Ministers have expressed surprise at fears of fast change after previous criticism that it was moving slowly.
The NHS IT upgrade will link more than 30,000 GPs to nearly 300 hospitals through an online appointments system.
It will also feature a centralised medical records system for 50 million patients, e-prescriptions and faster computer network links.
But the plans have received repeated criticism over security fears and a lack of enthusiasm among doctors for the technology.
Doctors' leaders have written to the government calling for parts of the programme to be suspended.
In a letter to Health Minister Mike O'Brien, the British Medical Association called for further independent evaluation of pilot schemes set up to test the system.
Summary Care Records are central to the NHS computer upgrade in England, which is the biggest healthcare IT programme in the world.
Patients are told by letter before their details go on the system, giving them the chance to opt out.
In December, the Department of Health announced that the roll-out of the records system would be accelerated.
Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA, said the "break-neck speed" with which this programme is being implemented is of "huge concern".
But Dr Simon Eccles, the medical director for the agency delivering the IT programme, Connecting for Health, said many patients were astonished that hospital doctors did not have access to basic information such as prescribed medications.
However, the government says the process to opt out is already straightforward.
It also argues that the BMA has supported similar schemes in Scotland and Wales.
This week, another two soldiers were killed on active service in Afghanistan, and another committed suicide in Iraq.
Maybe that's because, as a society, the vast majority of the population, and that includes politicians, have never fought in a war and do not really value or understand our men and women in the armed services.
Maybe that's the reason why the British army is known as "The Borrowers".
But what worries me more is that there is confusion on the ground in Afghanistan to what exactly the mission is.
This is dangerous because it puts our troops' lives at risk.
We know our forces are more than capable of fighting places like Helmand Province but the problem is that politicians say one thing to keep public opinion sweet, and down on the ground, the reality is different.
Even a second's delay in decision-making can mean the death of another soldier.
And our responsibility to our troops doesn't stop when they come home.
There are young men, some of them in their twenties, who have suffered both mentally and physically in operations from Northern Ireland to the Balkans and Iraq.
The controversial system is based around small files called cookies that some computer security firms say they may label as "adware" and block.
Other firms are waiting until the system is rolled out until they decide what to do with Phorm cookies.
Phorm said the firm was talking to security companies to explain how its system worked.
Many security firms contacted by BBC News said the tools included in security programs would let computer owners stop the cookie being used.
Phorm works by watching a user's web browsing habits and then slipping adverts related to that history onto websites that have signed up.
To target ads Phorm, like many other web businesses, uses a small text file called a cookie.
Some computer security companies contacted by the BBC say they may block the cookie that Phorm uses to keep an eye on a web user's habits.
The result would be blocking of the cookie and labelling it as adware.
Simon Heron, managing director of UK security firm Network Box, which provides security services to small businesses, said it would block the cookie initially.
Mr Heron acknowledged Phorm's efforts to abide by the Anti-Spyware Coalition's code of practice and its links with net firms but said security and privacy concerns had driven its blocking decision.
Symantec, Trend Micro and McAfee said they would monitor Phorm as it gets rolled out to see how the cookie is used in practice and whether users need warning about it.
Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said because it only provided services to businesses it was unlikely to be called on to block Phorm cookies.
He added that the website Phorm uses to serve up targeted ads would be entered into its security database to give customers the option of blocking that.
"Our aim is to give companies the power to police their users' safe use of the web, rather than disrupt what some may consider legitimate internet traffic," he added.
Greg Day, security analyst at McAfee, said it was still talking to Phorm about how the ad-serving system worked.
"At this point we have not rushed to give it a classification," he said.
Its eventual classification would come down to how the system was used, added Mr Day.
"Is the customer aware of it and do they have the choice of whether to opt in or out?"
Mr Day said that the cookie could end up being blocked by many users if security programs warn them about the tiny file.
He added that any company that blocked the Phorm cookie could consider blocking cookies from other ad-serving companies, such as Google, which gave users no choice to avoid being shown targeted ads.
England's three secure training centres (STCs) hold 188 children, some as young as 12.
They are there because their behaviour is so wayward and challenging.
They are also there because they are highly vulnerable and the chief issue is whether staff are being adequately trained to deal with such vulnerability.
Fifteen-year-old Gareth Myatt, who died at Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire in April, was being physically restrained when he lost consciousness and the ongoing inquiry is focusing on the manner of that restraint.
Deborah Coles of the pressure group Inquest said there was evidence that restraint had also played a role in the death of 14-year-old Adam Rickwood, at Hassockfield in County Durham.
"We are very concerned about the over-use of restraint in the STCs," she added.
Despite the plethora of inquiries into this latest death - the Youth Justice Board, Premier Prisons, which runs Hassockfield, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Prisons Ombudsman are all involved - the Home Office is now under considerable pressure to mark the gravity of the problem by setting up a public inquiry.
If Parliament was sitting, the home secretary could expect to be lobbied by MPs, 30 of whom signed a motion in July calling for an inquiry into the death of 16-year-old Joseph Scholes at a young offenders institution in 1992.
There has never been a public inquiry into the death of a juvenile in custody and there are no signs that David Blunkett is about to announce one.
Nor is the government impressed by criticism that the care of such vulnerable youngsters should not be in the hands of private contractors.
It is pointed out that staff-inmate ratios are relatively high and that private custody has tended to drive up standards in the public sector.
But ministers have already lost a court battle over their failure to apply the Children Act to the care of children in custody.
The lessons learned from the deaths of Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt may have an even more profound impact on the way these youngsters are treated.
The band are part of a line up which includes Calvin Harris, Dizzee Rascal and The Script.
Serge Pizzorno from the band said their sound was going to be "high energy rock 'n' roll".
It's the first time the band have played Swindon, but they'll be back again soon as the town also happens to be on their summer tour.
But the boys say the fact that Big Weekend is free is a real bonus in the credit crunch times.
The boys are playing alongside headliners Snow Patrol and frontman Gary Lightbody admitted that the responsibility was a bit daunting.
And nerves are something Basement Jaxx are also familiar with.
Felix and Simon from the band agreed that carrying on the mantle at a festival can be tricky stuff.
The Wombats are also on Saturday's bill and have been toying with some new ideas to get the crowd going, like last year's backstage Wombat-themed bar.
Murph said he had happy memories of his last Big Weekend experience where the band's 10 foot inflatable Wombat was introduced.
The 30-year-old Dutchman has been at the centre of summer transfer speculation and Ferguson has rejected an initial approach from Real Madrid.
"They have made an offer, we have rejected it," confirmed Ferguson.
Real have warned they will "not be held to ransom" over Van Nistelrooy, who Ferguson values at �16m.
"He is a striker who can score upwards of 20 goals a season and there are not many of those going around," the Scot said.
German side Bayern Munich are also in the hunt for Van Nistelrooy if his switch to Madrid falls through.
Real have failed with one bid for Van Nistelrooy, who has asked to leave Old Trafford, but The Bernabeu outfit still remain favourites to capture him.
"The fact that Bayern also want him indicates that the entire market is being scoured by Europe's top clubs looking to snap up the best players.
Meanwhile, Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge admitted that the German side have not given up hope of hijacking Real's bid for Van Nistelrooy.
"We are trying to get him signed," said Rummenigge.
Rummenigge is still confident Van Nistelrooy would choose a move to Germany over Spain.
"Every club wants to bring in important players, but it's the players themselves who have the final word," he added.
The Dutchman has scored 150 goals in 218 appearances since joining United from PSV for �19m in 2001.
The Premiership club needed to secure a bonus-point win against the pool two bottom side to have any hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals.
The two-time champions were unable to top the group after Leinster beat Edinburgh 12-3.
Wasps, who trailed 14-10 at half-time, ended second in the pool but with insufficient points to secure one of the two best runner-up spots.
Their loss, heralding the second straight season they have failed to progress in the competition, meant that Welsh region Ospreys qualified as one of the best-placed runners-up after beating Leicester on Saturday.
Both Toulouse and Bath - whose final match would have been winner-goes-through if Wasps had won - were also guaranteed a last-eight berth.
Wasps looked to be on course when a try from centre Dominic Waldouck handed them the lead 13 minutes from time.
But a host of missed chances before a second try for Thomas Bouquie handed Castres only their second win of the campaign.
Full-back Bouquie opened the scoring in the 14th minute when he dummied his way through the Wasps line and scampered over from 15m, converted by Romain Teulet.
Danny Cipriani slotted Wasps' first points in the 18th minute with a penalty but Castres increased the pressure when Chris Masoe crashed over after bullocking runs from prop Luc Ducalcon and number eight Iosefa Tekori.
Teulet kicked the conversion to open a 14-3 lead after 23 minutes but fly-half Cipriani added a stunning solo try before half-time.
The England star darted to the right of a ruck 10m inside the Castres half, stepped past Masoe and wing Rafael Carballo before racing clear to touch down under the posts.
A number of chances went begging for both sides, with Teulet and Cipriani missing with penalties and Wasps' Rob Webber failing to gather Paul Sackey's inside pass with the try line at his mercy.
Castres hooker Akvsenti Giorgadze also went close but was judged to have been held up over the try line following a length-of-the-field attack.
But Wasps made the home side pay and broke out from the resulting scrum, ending in Waldouck's try at the other end.
Cipriani and Teulet missed another kick each but Wasps hopes were dashed when Mark van Gisbergen knocked on after Dave Walder broke through, and Bouquie added his second four minutes from time.
"We had lots of chances to win this game but at this level you have got to be able to finish those chances and we didn't do that today.
"It was massively important for us to get to the quarter-finals and we went into the game knowing there were no guarantees.
England scrum-half Harry Ellis is relieved with his side's 36-11 victory over Italy in the Six Nations but admits England will need to improve before their next match.
Officers were overwhelmed by the scale of a disaster in which many of their own were victims.
Amid the chaos of water-filled streets they fought a desperate battle to stem a tide of lawlessness and looting.
Despite the heroic rescue efforts of many, there was still criticism - fuelled in part by reports that some police officers had deserted their posts.
Residents have told how they barricaded themselves into their homes, afraid to come out for fear of being robbed on the streets - and scared of becoming a target for armed gangs.
With the city now secured by the presence of 14,000 troops, the New Orleans Police Department is trying to rebuild its infrastructure, and its reputation.
"What we do about them is a matter for another place and time, but have no doubt, we will deal with them.
But he said many officers were angry at criticism of their efforts by outsiders.
Others who stayed throughout the disaster also see the police as victims of an unforeseeable set of circumstances.
Darryl Hill, a British ex-pat who helps manage a leading city hotel now housing a makeshift police HQ, said he was deputised by the Eighth District of the NOPD in the lawless hours after the flooding.
New Orleans police chief Eddie Compass has said that officers held their ground without food, water - even ammunition
Without powerful searchlights they traced criminals by the muzzle flashes of the weapons being fired at them, he said.
"In the annals of history, no police department in the history of the world was asked to do what we were asked," he said.
"We needed more resources, but those resources didn't come," he said.
Yet violent crime is a major problem here, as well as the petty thievery that plagues many tourist spots.
The murder rate is about 10 times the US average, and is bucking the national trend by rising noticeably in recent years, fuelled by drug and gang violence.
What the future holds when New Orleans returns to some semblance of normality is unknown.
At the moment, the department is trying to rotate officers off duty, 200 at a time, to give men and women time to see their families and to recuperate from the traumatic events of the past fortnight.
The sight of exhausted officers slumped in chairs, awaiting their next mission is still a common sight at police command posts around the city.
And it suggests that when the city's residents finally flood back, New Orleans will need all the resources and all the help it can muster.
The company was placed into administration on Wednesday after its major shareholders, Kerry Packer's Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, declared it insolvent.
Investigators from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) are examining documents and computer records at its Sydney headquarters, according to the Sydney newspaper group.
ASIC spokeswoman Kate Harvey said they were looking into potential breaches of corporation law.
"All I can tell you is that warrants were executed on a number of premises yesterday but we are not giving any further details," she said.
ASIC has reportedly questioned Lachlan Murdoch and James Packer over their joint statement issued on Wednesday that said they were not properly informed about the company's problems.
Relations had become soured following a damaging row over the rights to rugby league in Australia.
The collapse is all the more embarrassing for James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch because they were believed to have pressed for the investment despite a lack of enthusiasm from their fathers.
An auditor's report subsequently discovered that a $68m rights issue would not keep the company afloat.
PBL and News Corporation decided to place the company into administration.
The University College London research revealed that a third admitted "significant abuse".
Verbal abuse or threats were common, but just three of the 220 people questioned in the British Medical Journal study admitted physical abuse.
The Alzheimer's Society described the findings as "shocking", but said that many carers were under great strain.
The patients involved had just been referred to hospital psychiatric services for their condition.
In total 115 carers reported at least some abusive behaviour, and 74 reported more serious levels of mistreatment.
More than a quarter of the carers admitted screaming or yelling at their relative, while just under one in five said they had used a harsh tone or had sworn.
Other abuse recorded included threats to send the relative to a care home, or to stop caring for them.
A far smaller number admitted hitting, slapping, shaking or rough handling of the person with dementia.
The researchers, led by Dr Claudia Cooper, said that professionals tended to avoid the issue when talking to relatives.
"This may result in an 'all or nothing' approach to abuse, where it is ignored until the problem becomes serious.
However, the Alzheimer's Society said that the abuse of people with dementia should be considered in the same way as child abuse.
"We need to ask why it is happening - most carers do an excellent job in very difficult circumstances, but without help and support they are placed under enormous strain.
The government is currently consulting on a new policy for the safeguarding of "vulnerable adults", but the researchers said this was primarily focused on preventing abuse by paid carers, rather than family members, and called for it to be extended.
Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said the findings were "unsettling".
"Dementia requires a particularly dedicated form of care that puts enormous human and economic strains on our society.
Under the interpretation of Islamic Sharia law on which Afghanistan's constitution is based, Mr Rahman faces the death penalty unless he reconverts to Islam.
"The Prophet Muhammad has said several times that those who convert from Islam should be killed if they refuse to come back," says Ansarullah Mawlafizada, the trial judge.
The judge's comments are one indication of why President Hamid Karzai, who already has a reputation for being pro-Western, faces some difficult choices.
The president has yet to comment publicly on the trial but statements put out by hisoffice point out that, while the government respects human rights and personal freedom, the country has an independent judicial system.
The Afghan judiciary is dominated by religious conservatives, many with strong religious ties or backgrounds.
Many feel it will be difficult for the president and the government to confront thejudiciary.
But the bigger problem confronting the president is that an overwhelming number of ordinaryAfghans appear to believe Mr Rahman has erred and deserves to be executed.
At Friday prayers in mosques across the Afghan capital, the case of Abdul Rahman and the consequent international outcry is the hot topic of discussion and the centrepiece of sermons.
"We will not let anyone interfere with our religious practices," declared cleric Inayatullahat Kabul's Pulakasthy mosque, one of the city's largest.
The issue has not reached the stage of street protests, as was the caserecently during demonstrations against the publication in the West of cartoons satirising the Prophet Muhammad.
But there is little doubt that feelings run deep and can easily be inflamed.
"What is wrong with Islam that he should want to convert?" asks an agitated Abdul ZahidPayman.
Few were willing to listen to the growing condemnation in the West.
"According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because God has clearly stated that Christianity is forbidden in our land," says Mohammed Qadir, another worshipper.
US President George Bush says he is "deeply troubled" by the case.
That cuts no ice with Mr Qadir.
Western backers of the Afghan government are pressing to create a country that is a moderate and progressive democracy, able to turn its back on its Taleban past.
But analysts say they often forget that Afghanistan is a deeply conservative country rooted in tribal traditions.
Afghanistan's constitution, written in 2004, enshrines the country as an Islamic stateunder which no law can contravene Islam.
But it also protects personal freedom and respects international human rights conventions.
"It is a deliberately ambiguous document which tries to paper over the cracks and contradictions of Afghanistan," says one Afghan law professor privately.
Extra tickets had to be printed after the box office at the National Galleries of Scotland ran out and late openings were organised to meet the demand for the Edinburgh show's final weekend.
The Seine and the Sea exhibition featured 90 paintings by the impressionist master borrowed from galleries around the world.
Also on show were paintings dating from two stylistically distinct periods in the artist's career, from 1878 to 1883.
The event had previously broken the galleries' record for the most visitors ever recorded in the first week of an exhibition when 19,000 people came during its first week.
Galleries spokesman Sir Timothy Clifford said the success of the Monet exhibition had exceeded all expectations.
The RSA has been refurbished as part of the �30m five-year project to link it with the neighbouring National Gallery of Scotland.
Showing alongside the exhibition was a collection of works by French landscape painters who inspired Monet's work, including Corot and Courbet.
During the second stage of the restoration, an underground link, due to be completed in 2004, will be built between the RSA and the National Gallery of Scotland.
The new subterranean space will also house a 200-seat lecture theatre, cafe and shop.
Pupils from Cathays High School screamed, cheered and some even cried, when the 23-year-old arrived.
The prince spent time shaking their hands, and stopped to chat to lots of them.
He was at the school as part of his visit to Wales, to learn about the pupils' work with children in Africa.
They are raising money for a school in the African kingdom of Lesotho, a place Prince Harry knows well, because he set up a charity to help children there.
Lord Coe says the atmosphere in the stadium when India's women won the 4x400m relay "gripped" the crowd and believes Delhi has done "a terrific job" in hosting the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
Earlier reports linked the attack at the "Sizzlers" massage parlour to either gangsterism, drugs dealing or homophobia but the spokesman, Etienne Terblanche, said police now believed the motive was robbery.
Deputy Provincial Commissioner Mzwandile Petros said the arrests followed the issuing of identikits of the suspects, and the two men would appear in court next week.
The 42-year-old man was arrested on Thursday morning and his alleged accomplice in the evening, Mr Terblanche said.
"The man was questioned and following that he made a full confession before a magistrate," he said.
The 20 January attack shocked South Africa's gay community.
Cape Town markets itself as a top holiday destination for gay tourists.
Six men were found dead by police in the residential house in the Sea Point district of Cape Town.
Police described the scene as "horrific", saying there was "an incredible amount of blood about".
Three other men injured in the attack later died in hospital.
The only survivor is still placed under police protection programme in hospital.
He is among a growing number of inmates at the Naivasha maximum security prison, 80km west of the capital, Nairobi, who are learning to use computers.
The sound of computer keyboards emerging from this prison hosting about 8,000 is seen here as a metaphor for a quiet revolution taking place in Kenya's prisons.
Until recently, little was known about what went on behind prison walls in Kenya.
For many years, concerns had been raised over the inhuman conditions in Kenyan jails.
But since coming to power 16 months ago, the Narc government has promised to review the prison system and improve the living conditions of more than 50,000 prisoners in the country.
The man leading the computer-driven reform at the Naivasha prison is Assistant Commissioner of Prisons Benjamin Njoga.
"When they came here they didn't know anything about computers," says Mr Njoga.
They are due to sit for a basic computer examination in November.
As the inmates leap-frog into the computer age, life in the Naivasha prison appears less imprisoned by a history of degradation and inhumanity so common in Kenyan prisons.
The macho world of the male prison still exists here.
However, Mr Njoga says life in the Naivasha prison is gradually moving away from the cruel, inhuman or degrading routine that characterises the prison system in the country.
"These improvements have made the lives of inmates here quite bearable," he says.
Football has fast become the popular sport among inmates here, with its own prison league and one inmate providing live soccer commentary to his fellow inmates.
Back at the computer class, Peter Wagato remembers the first time he set his eyes on a computer.
"I have really acquired a lot of knowledge here," he says.
Of course, the reality of life in other Kenyan prisons is not quite so hi-tech yet.
But for these inmates, putting computers behind bars is still seen as a big step towards improving the lives and living conditions of Kenyan prisoners.
Emergency services at the scene of a shootout at the San Ysidro crossing
Four people were injured at the San Ysidro crossing after the agents fired shots to stop three vans from storming across the border, US officials say.
Some 70 suspected illegal immigrants crammed into the vans were arrested.
The San Ysidro crossing is known as a major smuggling corridor for drugs and illegal immigrants.
US officials say the gun battle took place on Tuesday afternoon when the suspected human traffickers in three vans tried to storm past border agents at the congested crossing between the US city of San Diego and Mexico's Tijuana.
The northbound lanes were shut down for several hours, creating a massive traffic jam at the crossing.
Some 40,000 vehicles enter California every day at San Ysidro - one of the busiest ports of entry along the entire border between Mexico and the US.
They accuse his campaign of forging some of the reported two million signatures on his nomination papers.
A spokeswoman for Mr Kasyanov's campaign described the prosecutors' move as "political pressure".
On Saturday he issued a statement complaining of official harassment.
The authorities refused to register his political party, which is why he was obliged to support his candidacy with a list of signatures.
But prosecutors say they suspect more than 15,000 of these are fakes.
And the electoral commission says it has found 62,000 forged signatures.
If these figures were officially confirmed, they would disqualify Mr Kasyanov from standing.
Mr Kasyanov responded by saying "the authorities are afraid of a direct political contest".
"The question today is, will the voters have a choice or not?" he told reporters.
Mr Putin is standing down as president because he is not allowed more than two consecutive terms as president.
Two other candidates have also registered for the poll - Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.
A leading liberal, former chess champion Garry Kasparov, had planned to run but said he could not after his supporters were not allowed to rent halls for nomination meetings.
The final candidates list is to be announced on Sunday.
Western observers have urged the Kremlin to stand back from the presidential poll.
They accused it of interfering in parliamentary elections last year, even though Mr Putin's party was likely to have won anyway.
Ms Rice was speaking in Jerusalem after three days of meetings with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian leaders.
She said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to meet every two weeks.
Ms Rice also said there was a "path of co-operation" with the new Palestinian unity government.
The secretary of state, speaking on the eve of the opening of an Arab League summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, also said a Palestinian peace deal by the end of next year was "not inconceivable".
Ms Rice urged Arab nations to take a more active role in regional peace efforts, although she said the presence of the militant Hamas faction in the Palestinian government made the issues "more complex".
Ms Rice said there could be co-operation with the new Palestinian unity government but stressed again that Hamas must renounce violence.
Hamas has refused to adhere to three key international demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and honour previous peace agreements.
Israel has rejected the new Palestinian government but Ms Rice has been trying to convince it to be more flexible.
"They achieved something, which is the very regularised meetings between the two of them, in which they will not just talk about their day-to-day issues, but also about a political horizon," she said.
Ms Rice said it was "not inconceivable" for a peace deal to be reached before the end of US President George W Bush's tenure.
The Arab League summit is expected to discuss a 2002 Saudi peace initiative under which Arab nations would recognise Israel if Israel withdrew from all territories occupied in the 1967 war.
There is also the possibility of a full regional summit which Mr Olmert has said he would not hesitate to attend.
But Ms Rice said it was "premature to talk about any specific kind of meeting".
Fashions in clothing are cyclical, but when it comes to the ideal body, the trend is for an increasingly pared-down form.
A report by the British Medical Association (BMA) published on Tuesday identifies a link between the images of "abnormally thin" models that dominate television and magazines, and the rise in conditions such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia.
The report says models and actresses have 10 to 15% body fat, compared to the healthy average of 22 to 26%.
Yet the women appearing on screen and in fashion spreads are much slimmer than they were 50 years ago, says Dr Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA head of science.
"Marilyn Monroe's body mass index (body fat) was 20%, which is at the low end of normal, but people now think of her as hefty.
And although thin is in, as in the 1960s when the waif-like Twiggy held sway on the fashion pages, that ideal has been updated to a slender frame with defined muscles and fulsome bosoms.
"We have spent so long talking about the problems of being over-weight that not enough is known about the dangers of being underweight.
Although men now account for 10% of the 60,000 people in the UK with an eating disorder, Dr Nathanson says those unhappy with how they look are more likely to over-train than under-eat.
In the book The Adonis Complex, US psychiatrists Harrison Pope and Katharine Phillips and clinical psychologist Roberto Olivardia found that nearly half of men today did not like their overall appearance, in contrast to just one in six in 1972.
They argued men wanted to look like the mythical half-man, half-god because muscles are all they have over women.
"Women can now fly combat aircraft, run multinational companies and have eliminated every last male bastion," said Professor Pope, of Harvard University, when the book was released in April.
Dr Nathanson says there is no one factor leading to an unhealthy preoccupation with body size and weight.
There would be a two-week holiday after each term, with the summer holiday cut to four weeks.
The changes could be introduced as early as next May.
"Children start the new school year at a lower level than when they left in the summer, and the majority do not get back to where they were until the end of the spring term.
"The current system of the three-term year with a long summer holiday is based on a time when children needed to be off school to help with collecting the harvest.
Parents whose children attend the The Greensward School and its four feeder primary schools will be consulted on the proposals.
After this process, they will be invited to vote in a ballot on changing the school year.
The proposals, which are likely to receive their backing, would allow family holidays to be taken outside of the peak summer period.
A majority of the school's teachers are also believed to be behind the proposals.
The Greensward School, a grant-maintained comprehensive with specialist technology college status, has 1274 pupils between the ages of 11 and 19.
The Local Government Association has backed its proposals to modify the school year.
In Cairo, pedestrians seemingly take their lives in their hands, striding out into oncoming traffic in the Middle East's most chaotic roads.
In Bangkok, crossing the street means playing chicken with armadas of scooters and cars that see pedestrian crossings as an obstacle course.
Matt Page, a lecturer at the Institute for Transport Studies at Leeds University, says the UK's roads are often designed with vehicles first.
So this is how it works in northern Europe - a system most Brits will be able to adapt to fairly quickly.
This local knowledge in a tourist-dependent city like Rome isn't much use to its many millions of visitors.
The European consumer testing agency EuroTest, based in Brussels, did a survey of more than 200 pedestrian crossings in 17 different cities last year partly because of this issue, with the help of local motoring organisations
"In Belgium for instance, if you cross the street anywhere other than a crossing and a police officer sees you, it's a 70-80 euro fine - and he'll take it as an insult that you saw him and still crossed!"
As motoring has developed, so has the design of systems to stop people and vehicles running into each other.
For the past four decades British roads have been built to keep pedestrian and driver separate - ostensibly to improve the safety of the lowly foot soldier; a patrician guiding hand preventing the unsophisticated, perhaps, from wandering into the grille of a juggernaut.
There are linked lights to make sure people aren't crossing in front of moving traffic, sloped kerbs, different textured pavement to help the blind, more visible signs showing when to walk, flashing graphics, tones and ticks and buzzes to tell us when we should be crossing, barriers to channel us into safe crossing zones.
For drivers, there are warning signs, lights, zigzagged lines and colour codes, all telling drivers to be careful, that people may be crossing ahead.
The best-designed crossing, according to EuroTest's research, was to be found in London, in the middle of Westminster between Tothill Street and Storey's Gate.
It has some well-designed features that make it visible to drivers (and a traffic island in the middle), but essentially it's a zebra crossing like those first designed in the 1940s - where pedestrians and drivers have to make eye contact.
Visiting Prague we were impressed by the 'Click-Clack' audible man who went faster as the lights were about to revert to the traffic.
The video - called Watching Over Me - features the story of 13-year-old George Atkinson, who was accidentally shot dead with an air gun.
The video, for 12 to 15-year-olds, has been made in a soap opera-style and also covers race issues.
George's mum has become a campaigner for the Gun Control Network.

Malachy McKernan and Olivia Martin, of the enterprise department, discussed the latest developments for the Northern Ireland Renewable Obligation (NIRO), which aims to support and develop sustainable electricity.
On the question of feed-in tariffs for individuals producing electricity on a small scale, the witnesses said there was a question over the cost efficiency of the feed-in tariff model and that it was important not to deter investors in Northern Ireland's electricity market.
However, that decision is pending the department's report on the matter, due in January 2010.
Watch the full video for Envy's Nadine
The Mancunian emcee travelled to London's Hounslow Boxing Club to do a full day shoot with director Charlotte Ginsborg for the promo.
Despite the long hours, Envy admits that she got "a bit carried away".
Envy says that what was also fun was the doing the 'champion dance', which she mentions in the lyrics of the song - and is happy to share with anyone who fancies joining in.
"It's basically the two step with swagger - you have got to believe you're the champ.
Envy is coming ever closing to needing to do it all the time at the moment.
The release of Nadine has seen her break out from specialist shows and on to daytime national radio - a major achievement for any new musician.
As happy as she is with that, there's one person that she really wanted to like the song - the titular Nadine.
Envy says that the real life Nadine loves the tune - so much so that she's gave it her ultimate blessing by coming down to the gym for the shoot.
"She loves the song - she cried when she heard it.
"It's a word-for-word true story, so it really hit her.
"She still blasts it out and she was in the video.
If things keep going as well as they have been doing, it won't be long until Nadine needs an Access All Areas pass to make it to Envy's microphone.
The 57-year-old pontiff made his appeal in front of a 300,000-strong crowd at Drogheda, a few miles from the Northern Irish border, during the first day of an historic tour of southern Ireland.
The Pope touched down at Dublin airport earlier today where he was met by the Irish president, Dr Patrick Hillery and a host of religious leaders.
It is the first time a reigning Pope has ever visited this devoutly Catholic country and John Paul II, who became Pope just 11 months ago, appears determined to use the trip to broadcast his messages of peace.
The Pope's original schedule had included a visit to Armagh in Northern Ireland but the Vatican called off the plans to go north of the border a day after the murder of Lord Mountbatten and the IRA ambush which resulted in the deaths of 18 soldiers in Warrenpoint in County Down.
Preparations have been taking place for weeks.
The entire Dublin police force has had all leave cancelled for the duration of the visit, bunting in the papal colours of yellow and white has been hung across the city and people have travelled from all over the country to catch a glimpse of the dynamic Polish priest.
The rest of his trip will include visits to Galway and the Marian shrine at Knock in County Mayo where, 100 years ago, local people claimed to have seen apparitions of the Virgin Mary.
It is anticipated that more than 500,000 people will attend an open-air mass at Knock.
The following day he will visit St Patrick's College at Maynooth and then travel by helicopter to Limerick before leaving for Boston airport to begin a tour of the United States.
He became a priest in 1946 before taking doctorates in theology and philosophy and studying in Rome.
At the age of 38 he became a bishop and at 44 was made Archbishop of Krakow.
The Pope died at 2137 (1937 GMT) on Saturday 2 April 2005 after he failed to recover from a throat operation.
Living life in front of the camera is nothing new to Anna Nolan, who survived unscathed into the final three of last year's Big Brother marathon.
She will soon be back on screen before long in two separate shows for the BBC - one a reality entertainment show, the other a quirky documentary series.
Nolan spoke to BBC News Online about Big Brother, her new career, her fingernails and top TV choices.

The best thing was leaving the house, without a doubt.
It was a pain really, it wasn't that enjoyable, no matter how good it looked on the telly!
The boredom - not being able to sleep at night because of taking too many naps during the day, out of boredom - not knowing what was going on outside.
Really the worst thing was not being able to speak to my girlfriend Tanya and not knowing how she was being affected by it all.
I would say don't give away too much of yourself too early, but then that makes for really boring television!
The first series, all the interesting, outgoing characters were kicked out early on, like Caroline and Nichola - you either loved or hated them.
But the three of us that were left, we weren't exactly the most outgoing over-the-top people.
So if you want to get to the end, maybe hold a bit back.

For the most part, they seem to me to be as hard-working as Westminster MPs, and attentive to those whom they represent, even at the week-day beck-and-call of constituents.
The actual costs are eleven-fold and more - resources which could have been used for hospitals, which the Scottish executive has built and plans to build through PFI, and a veritable financial millstone round the neck of our grandchildren.
Never before or since has delivery of public services been so effective and not least to the remoter parts of Scotland such as the Islands.
Inevitably, the Scottish Parliament has meddled in and encroached upon the legitimate areas of the local authorities.
If this unsatisfactory situation in Scotland has muddled on, sustained by Scottish Executive sweeteners, such as implementation of the proposals of Sutherland Committee on free care for the elderly, it is because of one fact.
Sooner, rather than later, there is going to be a hell of a row about money.
Actually, the first harbinger of trouble came when there was a majority of circa 160 and a phalanx labour back-benchers deeply objected to Foundation Hospitals being forced on their constituents, through the votes of MPs from Scotland, where the concept of Foundation Hospitals was not contemplated.
In the present Parliament, the position has become more acute with the policy of establishing City Academies, divisive and controversial as it is.
Only one thing is certain - the arrangement between Scotland and England, in its present form, cannot last.
One outcome is a set-up indistinguishable for separate Scottish and English states.
The other outcome is that we recognise that it is impossible to have a subordinate parliament in part, though only part of a state, which above all we wish to keep united; that we close down Holyrood and revert to the Scottish Regions - restoring dignity to local Government.
I favour the latter, but fear the former is more likely.
An Act of Disunion - a special Newsnight debate from Edinburgh - can be seen on BBC Two and on the Newsnight website at 2230GMT on Tuesday 16 January 2007.
They include images that show parts of the surface missed by the Mariner 10 spacecraft when it flew by the planet in the 1970s.
Like the previously mapped portions of Mercury, the new sections appear heavily cratered.
Messenger needs to perform another two fly-bys and a number of engine firings to get itself into orbit in 2011.
Monday's manoeuvre took the probe to within just 200km (125 miles) of the planet at closest approach.
Messenger was programmed to collect more than 1,300 images and make other observations during the encounter.
The data began transmission to Earth on Tuesday.
Nasa says such detailed close-ups will be used by planetary geologists to study the processes that have shaped Mercury's surface over the past four billion years.
The picture shows part of a giant impact crater to the bottom-right.
It shows a previously unseen crater with distinctive bright rays of ejected material extending radially outward from the crater's centre.
Resolution in the picture is about 360m per pixel, and the width of the image is about 370km.
Monday's flyby has produced a sequence of pictures that will allow scientists to build a high-resolution mosaic of the northeast quarter of the region not seen by Mariner 10.
The large, shadow-filled, double ringed crater in this picture was glimpsed by the 1970s probe and named Vivaldi, after the Italian composer.
It was taken when the probe was about 18,000km from the surface of Mercury, and about 55 minutes before closest approach.
The image shows smooth plains, many impact craters (some with central peaks), and rough material that appears to have been ejected from the large crater to the lower right.
This 200km-wide crater was also seen in less detail by Mariner 10.
New initiatives designed to attract and retain teachers were "beginning to show some fruit", Mr Blunkett said.
But in spite of the �6,000 training salary for graduate teachers and another �4,000 bonus award for shortage areas, he added, many more teachers were needed.
Figures released earlier this month showed 28,000 people started initial teacher training courses or the graduate teacher programme in the autumn - an increase of 8% on the previous year.
The increase was 5% for secondary teachers - but this was 13% short of the government's target.
Mr Blunkett also admitted he had been "wrong" over the level of pressure put on schools not to expel unruly pupils, and had responded by changing the guidance.
The government was planing to provide a "dowry", where expelled children "carry extra cash with them into the schools that are prepared to take them", he said.
Head teachers had got to the point where they felt they could not exclude a child who was causing disruption, he said.
But the shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said David Blunkett's comments were "too little too late".
"I have been telling him for the past two years that there is a recruitment crisis," she said.
Labour's targets for school exclusions must be abolished, she said, as they were "tying the hands of teachers and forcing schools to keep disruptive or violent pupils".
Tony Blair said Labour was the party of economic competence and accused the Tories of "running away" from debating the issue.
But Tory Michael Howard said Labour had broken their last poll pledges, while Lib Dems Charles Kennedy said they had been unfair to students and pensioners.
With a television debate between the party leaders ruled out, Wednesday's session was their only chance for a head-on confrontation before 5 May.

He has announced his retirement as a player and now wants to move into management.
Townsend, nearly 37, made 70 appearances for theRepublic and was captain for many years.
He also had a great domestic football career with Southampton, Norwich,Chelsea, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and West Brom.
Townsend left West Brom this week after reaching an agreement over thefinal 12 months of his contract.
Albion manager Gary Megson wanted to keep Townsend and even offered him a coaching role.
But Townsend turned down it down, stating he wanted to pursue his ownmanagerial career.
Celtic just about deserved their victory against a Boavista side that failed to excite, although the Scottish champions played well below their best.
Larsson's 78th-minute strike was the one bright point in a highly disappointing and dour match.
But the performance will be forgotten as the Celtic supporters prepare for the trip to Seville, where their team will play Porto in the final on 21 May.
With so much at stake, the opening exchanges were tentative, but Celtic settled first and created the game's first decent goalscoring opportunity.
A hopeful Alan Thompson free-kick was flicked on by the head of John Hartson, allowing Larsson a sight of goal, but the Swede uncharacteristically pulled his shot wide under pressure from Eder Silveira.
Boavista scarcely threatened the Celtic goal in the opening quarter of the game and when they did manage a shot at goal on 21 minutes, Luis Pedrosa's long-range free-kick was well off target.
Three minutes later, Pedrosa attempted a similar effort, but again the shot flew over Rab Douglas' bar.
Celtic were forced to bring Chris Sutton into the fray rather earlier than planned when Paul Lambert was forced off with an ankle injury with just over half an hour gone.
The home side's first significant effort came after 36 minutes when Pedro Santos let fly from outside the box, but the ball was always curling wide of Douglas' left-hand post.
Douglas came to Celtic's rescue two minutes before the interval when he reacted quickly to palm Elpidio Silva's header away after Martelinho had capitalised on Joos Valgaeren's slip to get behind the Celtic defence.
But Douglas almost handed the Portuguese the lead on 59 minutes when he misjudged Duda's cross and succeeded only in knocking the ball into Silva's path.
The Brazilian got his header on target but Johan Mjallby managed to deflect the ball wide of the post with Douglas stranded.
Celtic struggled to get going in the second half until Alan Thompson had a fierce drive deflected wide on 70 minutes as they sought that elusive away goal.
It finally came eight minutes later, when Larsson played a slightly fortunate one-two with Boavista defender Filipe Anunciacao before finishing clinically from 12 yards.
Didier Agathe might have conceded a penalty with four minutes remaining when he appeared to catch Jocivalter in the area, but the referee saw nothing amiss and Celtic held on for a famous win.
The 18-year-old had played a loan spell at Aldershot last season where he made four appearances.
Parrett has played for England at Under-17 and Under-19 levels and featured for Spurs in the Uefa Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk.
Due to his age, Tottenham have the right to recall Parrett after 28 days if they see fit.
The Bulls promoted 34-year-old assistant boss McNamara after Brian Noble defected to Wigan on Thursday.
McNamara, who turned down an approach from Hull a fortnight ago, becomes the youngest head coach in Super League.
And despite his relative inexperience, he has no doubts he is ready to step up.
"When you finish your playing career people call you a veteran but now I am the youngest coach and it has put a spring back in my step," said McNamara.
McNamara faces a tough task following Noble, who guided the Bulls to five straight Super League Grand Finals, winning three of them.
His first test will be to steer the side through a tricky trip to Warrington, who won at Odsal a fortnight ago, on Sunday.
However, McNamara has been impressed by the Bulls' performances in beating Leeds and Huddersfield over Easter.
"It has been an eventful week and the players deserve a massive amount of credit for the way they have handled it," said McNamara.
In a press conference yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron said that "because party leaders were so keen to win the support of newspapers we turned a blind eye to the need to sort this issue, get on top of the bad practices, to change the way our newspapers are regulated".
But is it ever possible for prime ministers to stand beyond the influence of newspapers and the media?
"You can't put drops of Rupert Murdoch into a test tube to test how toxic it is," he said.
The area where the influence was felt greatest was over European policy where, he said, Labour "promised" News International that there would be no changes in policy without talking to them first.
"The influence of Rupert Murdoch on the European issue was very strong," he said.
But Jack Straw, ever-present in the Blair cabinet, said that Lance Price was "simply wrong" about Labour's promise to News International - European scepticism was led by politicians, like him and Gordon Brown, within the cabinet.
"Of course Tony Blair had a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch, but Tony was actually very independent from Rupert Murdoch's position on Europe," he said.
He accepted, however, that any political leader, especially Labour leader, had to make their peace with the right-wing press in the UK, otherwise, they "ensured that we have got stuffed in elections".
Georgia is adamant that there can be no compromise over the status of South Ossetia to the extent that it avoids the use of the name South Ossetia, which it sees as implying political bonds with North Ossetia.
Insisting that North Ossetia is, in fact, the only Ossetia, Tbilisi prefers to call South Ossetia by the historic Georgian name of Samachablo or, more recently, Tskhinvali Region.
In August 2008 Georgia's efforts to regain control of the area suffered a crippling blow when Russia - the South Ossetian separatists' military backers - defeated a Georgian incursion into South Ossetia in a bloody five-day conflict.
The Ossetians are believed to be descended from tribes which migrated into the area from Asia many hundreds of years ago and settled in what is now North Ossetia.
As the Russian empire expanded into the area in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Ossetians did not join other peoples of the North Caucasus in putting up fierce resistance.
By tradition, the Ossetians have had good relations with Russians and were regarded as loyal citizens, first of the Russian empire and later of the Soviet Union.
They sided with the Kremlin when Bolshevik forces occupied Georgia in the early 1920s and, as part of the carve-up which followed, the South Ossetian Autonomous Region was created in Georgia and North Ossetia was formed in Russia.
In the twilight of the Soviet Union, as Georgian nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to prominence in Tbilisi, separatist sentiment burgeoned in South Ossetia.
After several outbreaks of violence between Georgians and Ossetians, the region declared its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 and, the following year, declared de facto independence.
The collapse of the USSR and Georgian independence in 1991 only strengthened South Ossetia's determination to break with Tbilisi.
Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continued until the summer of 1992 when agreement on the deployment of Georgian, Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers was reached.
Making clear his intention to bring the breakaway regions to heel, Mr Saakashvili offered South Ossetia dialogue and autonomy within the Georgian state.
But his offer fell far short of separatist demands, and in 2006 South Ossetians overwhelmingly voted to restate their demand for independence in a referendum that Georgia did not recognise.
Tensions came to head in early August 2008, when, after nearly a week of clashes between Georgian troops and separatist forces, Georgia launched a concerted air and ground assault attack on South Ossetia, briefly gaining control of Tskhinvali.
Declaring its citizens to be under under attack, as most South Ossetians have Russian passports, Moscow sent in troops and launched air attacks on the Georgian forces.
Within days Russian forces had swept the Georgians out of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and then proceeded to occupy parts of Georgia, causing panic in Tbilisi.
Following Western protests, Russia pulled its forces back towards South Ossetia and Abkhazia under a cease-fire agreement, but days later proceeded formally to recognise both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.
Internationally, only Russian's Latin-American allies Venezuela and Nicaragua have recognised South Ossetian independence, apart from a few Pacific island states.
In April 2009, Russia bolstered its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, as well as those of Abkhazia.
Ms Dzhioyeva was barred from the re-run, and her supporters held 10 days of protests.
After his election win, Mr Tibilov promised to build a "new and successful legitimate state" and vowed to try to heal old wounds in the region.
At his swearing-in, he promised to be faithful to South Ossetia's Russian backers and to tackle the alleged misuse of Moscow's aid money.
As Mr Tibilov took office, local and Russian commentators predicted that he would face a major challenge in overcoming Mr Kokoity's legacy, with success depending on his ability to remove the former leader's associates from key posts.
The South Ossetian authorities operate a TV service and programmes from Russia are rebroadcast in the territory.
Georgian state-run TV broadcasts a daily news programme in Ossetian; a daily two-hour programme in the language is aired by Georgian state radio.
Russian-language, pro-Georgian station Alania TV targets viewers in South Ossetia from a transmitter in Georgia.
It is the latest move in the bitter and deeply divisive debate about the provision of abortion services in the United States.
But pro-choice groups describe it as a major new restriction on abortion and further evidence of a trend towards the erosion of abortion rights.
The Hyde-Weldon Abortion Non-Discrimination Act allows health care providers, including hospitals and insurance companies, to opt out of providing or paying for abortion services without the threat of penalty, such as having their access to public funds restricted or stopped.
It is a new version of similar legislation introduced back in 2002, which was then approved by the House of Representatives but not by the Senate.
And President Bush is thought to give the legislation his personal backing.
Groups who want access to abortion to be more restricted strongly support the legislation.
Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee accuses pro-choice groups of using state funding to exert pressure on health care providers to provide abortions.
"There has been in the United States an orchestrated campaign by pro-abortion pressure groups to force health care providers to participate in abortions," he told the BBC.
He cites as evidence a case in Alaska of a non-religious community hospital that was told by the courts it had to provide abortion services because it received state support.
He also gives examples of religiously affiliated hospitals that have had their attempts to enter into partnerships or even merger deals with other health care providers vetoed by state or local officials because the religious hospitals refuse to perform abortions.
Pro-choice advocates see the issue very differently.
"This is not about the individual conscience of one doctor," he told the BBC.
He says no law requires an individual doctor to perform an abortion against his or her will but at the moment health care providers do have a legal obligation, if they receive state funding, to provide abortion services, including counselling and referrals.
"This will allow corporations to impose their ideology on medical services," he said.
The move comes as both sides of the debate are focussing on the Bush administration's second term and its implications for abortion services in the US.
At the heart of the discussion is the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that legalised abortion in the United States.
Both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups cite their own polls of public opinion as evidence to support their case.
Mr Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee says there is a trend towards supporting greater restrictions on abortion.
"We didn't get our current legal regime by majority vote, we got it from seven lawyers," he says.
Seven of the nine Supreme Court justices supported a women's right to abortion in the 1973 ruling, and his reference to the court highlights another key part of the US abortion debate.
Some commentators predict between two and four vacancies in the Supreme Court in the course of President Bush's four-year second term.
Pro-choice groups fear that President Bush will alter the composition of the court by favouring anti-abortion conservative candidates, and they believe the addition of more conservatives could lead to further restrictions on abortion rights.
A recent row about comments on Roe v Wade by Senator Arlen Specter showed the strength of feeling.
Mr Specter is a pro-choice Republican who is a leading candidate for the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which plays a key role in appointments to the Supreme Court.
He was reported as saying that Supreme Court nominees who wanted to overturn Roe v Wade were unlikely to be approved by the Senate.
Right-wing groups responded with anger, describing Senator Specter as a "problem".
Some accused Senator Specter of softening his position in response by saying that, although he was himself pro-choice, he had in the past supported many anti-abortion nominees.
The composition of the Senate too has become more conservative since the election.
Mr Johnson says it is impossible to say whether Roe v Wade may be overturned in the next four years but he agrees the current Senate leans more to the right on abortion than its predecessor.
That could mean more legislative restrictions related to abortion, including laws requiring parental notification and restricting late-term abortions.
Still in his Bermuda shorts and flip-flops he drove back to New York city.
The radio in his car was broken so he had no idea that two bombs had just destroyed two US embassies in East Africa in an apparently co-ordinated attack.
Within hours he was on his way to the Kenyan capital Nairobi with an FBI unit, assigned to provide personal security for the leader of the team, Pat D'Amuro.
By Sunday they were standing at the site where over 200 people had died and a massive rescue operation was still underway.
Two days later, one of many anonymous phone calls to the makeshift FBI headquarters indicated that a man had booked into a hotel in a suburb of the city and was acting suspiciously.
Pat D'Amuro needed to send someone to check out the story.
Gaudin, armed with just six years service in the FBI and no previous experience in international terrorism, set out on what would turn out to be one of the most extraordinary assignments of his career.
Early the next morning, Gaudin arrived in a suburb called Eastleigh, accompanied by members of the Kenyan police force and two colleagues from the US.
Eastleigh is known locally as Somalitown because so many Somali immigrants live there.
The Kenyan police advised Gaudin that someone looking so obviously North American could be in danger in that part of town, so he travelled out of sight in the back of the van.
Steve Gaudin explains what happened when he first met an al-Qaeda suspect
Back at the police station in Nairobi, Gaudin began questioning him.
Saleh was treated in hospital and had been recovering in a small hotel in Eastleigh for the last few days.
But Gaudin was curious about his appearance.
What had he done with his old clothes? The clothes he had been wearing on the day of the bombing.
Saleh claimed he was wearing the same clothes he had been wearing on the day of the bombing, but Gaudin felt sure he was lying.
As the questioning continued, Gaudin also began to get the sense that Saleh had been trained in counter-interrogation techniques.
When he put this to him, Saleh did not seem surprised.
Describing the moment an al-Qaeda suspect in the Nairobi bombings confessed
Gaudin interviewed Saleh for 10 days.
During that time his colleagues were investigating other leads and producing evidence including incriminating telephone records and forensic evidence of explosives at a house which Saleh had contacted by phone.
Everything pointed to Saleh's involvement and Gaudin finally presented all the evidence to him.
Then, suddenly, Saleh changed tactics.
He told Gaudin the whole story.
What happened after an al-Qaeda suspect confessed to the 1998 Nairobi bombing
But due to some last-minute errors and confusion, he had decided not to die with his fellow bomber.
At the last moment, he had run away.
Three weeks after the bombing, Steve Gaudin accompanied al-Owhali back to the US to face trial.
In May 2001, four months before 9/11, he was found guilty of involvement in the bombing and was later sentenced to life imprisonment.
Steve Gaudin described this extraordinary case as a "life-changing experience" and on his return to the US, did not go back to domestic criminal work.
Experts found animals that fool around are only following the urges of biology.
New studies using genetic testing techniques show that even the most apparently devoted of partners often go in search of the sexual company of strangers.
Females stray to gather the best possible genes for theiroffspring, while males are driven to father as many and as often as possible.
"True monogamy actually is rare," said Stephen T Emlen, an expert on evolutionary behaviour at Cornell University.
According to him, there are two kinds of monogamy - social and genetic.
While social monogamy is relatively common, genetic monogamy is the exception rather than the rule.
Dr Emlen said there are only two monkeys, the marmoset and the tamarin, are truly monogamous.
All other primates, includes humans, often mate outside their partnerships.
"One of the patterns is that females seek males of high status and high quality," said Dr Emlen.
Males are said to be biologically driven to stray by the desire to spread their genes into as many members of the next generation as possible.
But the reasons why people have sex outside a relationship are far more complex.
Researchers generally believe that monogamy originated among species whose young survived best when raised by a bonded pair.
This may have led to the rise of monogamy among people, since human children take so long to mature.
Faithful sex partnership has been thought for years to be widespread among birds.
The eastern bluebird was considered a prime example, with male and female partners working together to build nests, incubate eggs, then feed and raise their young.
But researchers have found that the bluebirds have a sex life that rivals a television soap opera.
Patricia Adair Gowarty, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Georgia, has found that 15% to 20% of chicks cared for by a pair of bluebirds were not fathered by the male.
She found that only 10% of 180 socially monogamous species are sexually faithful.
The research is published in the journal Science.
He said Nato's European members must do more if it was to "come through this test of its resolve and character".
Lessons learned there and in Iraq would lead to a "transformation" of policy by the UK Ministry of Defence.
He also told the BBC troops could leave when Afghan forces could "manage the insurgency at an appropriate level".
Mr Hutton sought to set out the goals of the mission in interviews for BBC One's Politics Show and BBC Radio 4's the World this Weekend ahead of meeting his US counterpart this week.
He said UK troops, whom he paid tribute to, were in Afghanistan "first and foremost to tackle fundamental extremism which is a risk to the security of our citizens and our country".
In the process, he said, this would allow Afghan politicians to "create more of a consensus for people to come together and put down their weapons".
"What we've got to concentrate on is protecting the local population from the extremists and the terrorists and build up these credible Afghan forces.
"Because the one thing that will allow us to come out of Afghanistan at some point is when we can leave behind credible and determined security forces who can manage the level of insurgency at an appropriate level.
Asked if the mission had changed to a counter-insurgency one, Mr Hutton said lessons had to be learned from the "complicated operations" in Iraq and Afghanistan as they were going to "define the characteristics of future conflict for decades" and "much of the politics of the 21st Century".
Mr Hutton said the Ministry of Defence was going to "focus very heavily" over the next year on changes to training and equipment.
He also said that European members of Nato had to do more and not expect the US to do all the "heavy lifting".
The defence secretary's comments come the day after a soldier from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Welsh Regiment was killed in an explosion in Musa Qala in northern Helmand.
He has been named as Lance Corporal Christopher Harkett, 22, from The 2nd Battalion, Royal Welsh Regiment.
His death brings the number of British service personnel killed in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 to 150.
Carlisle United manager John Ward tells BBC Radio Cumbria his side are determined to make amends for last Saturday's 5-0 defeat to Colchester when they face Hartlepool on Tuesday.
And, when the striker first entered the cauldron of Argentine football for Buenos Aires club Independiente at the age of only 15 years and 35 days in 2003, he broke a much-vaunted record previously held by one of the greatest players ever to kick a ball.
Since then El Kun - a nickname given to Aguero because of his likeness to a Japanese cartoon character - has become one of the hottest properties in world football, earning a lucrative move to Spanish giants Atletico Madrid and making his international debut for two-time World Cup winners Argentina.
By way of introduction to the man behind the player, Aguero - now 19 - tells BBC Sport what makes him tick.
It is always a great feeling to get recognition based on your performance, especially when it's against a team like Barcelona.
It was a bit difficult to adapt at first but, little by little, I have learned to adjust to the type of football here in Spain, the city, the players and the club.
At times, especially in the beginning, I think I became a target for malicious tackles and so referees were forced to look after or protect me, or at least pay closer attention to intentional rough hits.
But eventually I learned to avoid these rough tackles and improved so that I was able to anticipate and dodge injuries.
Signing with Atletico was one of the best decisions in my life.
What's more is that Atletico is a well-known club within Argentina and so there are many people who have defended the red and white colours throughout history.
The press has published stories about Chelsea, Juventus, Inter Milan, Villarreal, Bayern, Palermo, Liverpool and Hamburg.
Kun actually represents a Japanese cartoon character from my favourite series that I used to watch as a child.
I coined the nickname Kun because of my resemblance to the character, who was actually named Kum Kum.
He is a great player and even a better person but I think it's important to remember that Fernando had gone through a lot with Atletico and he was always a point of reference, not only for me but for all Atletico supporters worldwide.
He had grown up being an Atletico fan and eventually worked his way up to the first team but I don't think I have that same sort of pressure, especially because I transferred here from Argentina.
His departure to Liverpool was unfortunate but it is important to remember that last summer the club invested a great deal on quality and skill and so I feel as though everyone on the team today demonstrates a vast amount of ability and talent.
I think that we are very close to challenging the likes of Real, especially next season.
This is a risk and a fear that most professional athletes try to avoid but I try not to think about it too much.
I have gained a lot of experience in football since my arrival here competed with and against some of the world's best on the pitch.
Coach Javier Aguirre would always remind me that when I don't have possession of the ball, I should return to the halfway line because it's important to defend more since teams are tougher here in Spain.
I think that the best advice that Aguirre gave me was to strengthen my work and team ethic, which took some time for me to develop.
I had to learn to let go of any other pressure that surrounded me during a game and to focus only on what needed to be done.
I watch Premier League games on television but I'm more fixed on the players than on the teams, especially because in England the footballers are of a larger size.
I do root for certain teams when watching Champions League for instance, like Liverpool since Fernando plays for them, but I am very content here.
The players are out of contract in the summer and the club have already said not all of them will be able to stay.
Wanderers striker Andy Rammell fears he is one of the players who boss Lawrie Sanchez will not be able to keep.
"There's 11 of us up in June and we have to just wait for the gaffer to sort the finances out, " he said.
The 36-year-old admits it could be the end of his playing career if Wycombe let him go.
"There's no money and there's so much insecurity at a lot of clubs," he said.
Sanchez has agreed to tell the players which of them will be forced to leave before next month's transfer deadline.
Wycombe midfielder Steve Brown will not have to worry about his future as he has just signed a one-year extension.
The station said the Iraqi Information Ministry had barred Diyar al-Omari - an Iraqi - from reporting, and ordered correspondent Tayseer Alouni to leave the country.
The channel's editor-in-chief, Ibrahim Helal, told the BBC that the Iraqis had given no reasons for their action, which he called sudden and unjustified
Al-Jazeera says it will continue to transmit images from its offices in Baghdad, Basra and Mosul.
The station interrupted a regular broadcast to make its announcement.
"We faced lots of things like that before from the Iraqi Government and from other governments in the Arab region, because this is a way they think," Mr Helal told the BBC.
The US and UK have accused the station of bias and criticised it for airing pictures of dead Western troops.
Al-Jazeera's new English-language website has suffered a number of denial-of-service attacks since the war began, in which hackers flooded the site with junk messages.
Visitors were also redirected to web pages with pro-US messages or pornography.
Iraq expelled correspondents for the US cable news broadcaster CNN last week.
Based on a US model, the court will deal with family cases where addicted parents are neglecting their children.
It will not hear criminal cases but will fast-track parents to treatment and recovery with support from therapists and social workers.
Mentors, who have themselves been through the courts, also offer support.
Three London councils - Westminster, Islington and Camden - have combined to set up the initiative, which will sit at the Inner London Family Proceedings Court.
Currently two-thirds of children taken into care in inner London have parents with drug or alcohol problems.
The concept of the court is American and relies on swift and co-ordinated action from drug experts, social workers and housing professionals.
The judge could order parents to attend one-to-one counselling or group sessions to avoid having their kids taken into care.
He said the court would not focus solely on detoxifying the parent, but seek at the same time to understand the other problems that could be contributing to their situation.
These could include abusive relationships, debt, mental health problems, learning difficulties, and housing issues.
The court could recommend visits to the housing department, Alcoholics Anonymous sessions, and even advise ending abusive relationships.
"To some extent we might have to be uncomfortably directive," Judge Crichton said.
Parents' progress will be monitored by the same judge every two to four weeks - a point emphasised by Judge Crichton as key to the pilot's success.
In the US, the courts have a high success rate of keeping children with their parents after they have received help.
The project will be evaluated by experts from Brunel University to see if parents on its programme are more successful in tackling their substance abuse.
It will also monitor whether children of addict parents can safely remain at home, or if the scheme helps youngsters in care be returned to their parents.
Judith Harwin, professor of social work at Brunel University, said there were two problems with the existing policy of dealing with addictive parents.
In cases of illegal drug use, such as crack or heroin, authorities had "far too speedy a response" to remove the child before "parents have a chance to show whether they can address their problems".
"This means the child may drift in care for a long time", which could have poor outcomes for their future education, health and employment prospects, Professor Harwin said.
Last season only an inexplicable fall in the final race of the season cost Rossi his title, handing it to American Nicky Hayden, but this season is an entirely different matter.
And the reason for that is the youngest rider in the competition, Australia's Casey Stoner.
At 21, Stoner has long been regarded as a rider of huge potential, but with an unfortunate habit of failing to stay on his bike.
Last season, his first in MotoGP, he managed to finish eighth in the championship, despite his failure to score any points in seven races, largely due to falling off.
But Ducati team chief Livio Suppo had seen enough in the youngster to sign him up to ride their new 800cc bike for 2007.
Four wins in the first seven races of the season have vindicated his decision and taken Stoner to the top of the standings, 14 points clear of Rossi.
"We knew he was very fast and talented, but it's been better than we could possibly expect," Suppo told BBC Sport.
"His speed was the main reason we signed him, but also because of his character.
Some people might have baulked at the idea of hiring someone with only one season's top class experience and a dubious record for staying in his seat, but Suppo's faith has been rewarded in the best possible way.
Stoner could certainly never be accused of having had 'the best' handed to him on a plate - far from it.
Having won every competition he could enter back home, in 2000 the 14-year-old and his parents moved to England so he could start road racing, living in a caravan for a year while he got established on the circuit.
Seven years down the line, Stoner is living in Monaco, married, sitting atop the world rankings and taking nothing for granted.
"When I arrived, I struggled a bit as an Australian," he told BBC Sport.
The presence of wife Adriana, who he married in January, has certainly had a positive impact on Stoner's career.
Stoner looks even younger than his 21 years, but seems to take the pressure of riding for one of the most famous names in motorsport - and consistently riding faster than anyone else - comfortably in his stride.
And nowhere yet has that concentration been tested more than in the most recent race, at Catalunya, where Stoner went toe-to-toe with Rossi - and won.
Their duel in the closing stages of the race, and Stoner's refusal to be out-muscled by the seven-time world champion, made for one of the most thrilling confrontations motorcycling has seen in years.
"It was clear to see Casey had speed, the difficult question was does he have calmness under pressure," said Jenkins.
"But to resist the pressure of Rossi all over him at Barcelona was something special in anyone, whether he's a new arrival or has been around for years.
As Rossi's team-mate, Colin Edwards has seen plenty of people try to challenge the man they call 'The Doctor' and come off worse.
But he is not surprised by Stoner's success.
"When you look at the first half of this season, the work Casey's done in that time is maybe more than Hayden did all of last year when he won the championship," he said.
In years to come, Stoner's refusal to make way for Rossi in Catalunya may come to be seen as the passing of the torch from one proven motorcycling legend to another one in the making.
So far this season, the man from Kurri Kurri in New South Wales has certainly given plenty of evidence to suggest he could end up dominating the next few years in the same way Rossi has dominated the past few.
If you visit Stoner's website and click on the tab marked 'Career', it takes you to a page just saying "coming very soon".
On the strength of what we have seen from Stoner so far this season, "very soon" may well already have started.
Georgia is a small former Soviet republic with a strongly pro-western government with ambitions to join Nato.
The move will make it one of the leading contributors to the US-led forces in the country.
It comes as other countries like Britain, Denmark and Lithuania plan to reduce their troop numbers in Iraq.
Since the current Georgian government came to power after the Rose Revolution in 2003, one of its main goals has been to join Nato.
By sending more troops to serve in Iraq, it hopes to send a message that it can contribute to what it describes as global security.
Georgia has been trying to modernise its army with help from American military advisors.
In a statement, President Mikhail Saakashvili said that Georgia wanted to do everything possible to help the Iraqi people and US-led forces to bring peace and freedom to the country.
Mr Saakashvili also indicated recently that Georgia would be willing to send troops to serve with Nato forces in Afghanistan.
Support for joining Nato is widespread in Georgia - people see it as a guarantee of security in the country's long-running dispute with its powerful neighbour, Russia, and as an indication that it will not give up its pro-Western direction.
But, although Nato has offered encouragement, it is not yet clear whether Georgia will be ready to join by the end of the decade and its plans are strongly opposed by Moscow.
The clothing retailer said in February it would not pursue a roll-out of the concept, instead focusing on turning round its core Gap and Old Navy brands.
Gap has not seen a rise in quarterly same-store sales since 2004 and is currently looking for a new boss.
The retailer, which also owns the Banana Republic brand, is seeking a new chief executive after Paul Pressler stepped down in January by mutual agreement.
Gap's non-executive director Robert Fisher has taken over as temporary head of Gap.
He said finding a leader with suitable experience to help the retailer, which has 3,000 stores worldwide, regain its iconic position in casual fashion, would take some time.
Hockney told the Guardian newspaper that photographs can be so easily altered these days that they can no longer be seen as factual or true.
He also said art photography was "dull" and that it was inferior to painting.
But Russell Roberts of the National Museum of Photography, Film and TV said Hockney's argument was "simplistic".
Hockney also said war photography was cast in doubt due to digital advancement.
He cited the case during the Iraq war when the Los Angeles Times sacked a photographer for superimposing two images to make them more powerful.
"But you can't have a photographer like that again because we know photographs can be made in different ways," he added.
Hockney hopes that painting will gain in standing as more people realise the camera can be made to lie.
The artist said his sister's use of digital photography had brought home the effect manipulation was having.
Hockney told The Guardian that no photograph or video could ever capture the tenderness of a Rembrandt drawing showing a young family teaching a child to walk.
Eamonn McCabe, a former picture editor at The Guardian, admitted the general perception of photography as truth had been lost.
But he said this did not take anything away from good photography.
Archaeologist Muazzez Ilmiye Cig was prosecuted over a book in which she linked the wearing of headscarves with ancient Sumerian sexual rites.
The judge ruled at the first hearing of her trial that her actions did not constitute a crime.
Dr Cig's publisher was also cleared in a trial lasting less than half an hour.
The archaeologist was applauded by supporters as she left the courtroom.
This trial is the latest in a series of prosecutions of Turkish intellectuals, including 2006 Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and novelist Elif Shafak.
Charges were brought against her by a Turkish lawyer who took offence at her 2005 book "My Reactions as a Citizen".
In the book Dr Cig said that headscarves were first worn more than 5,000 years ago by Sumerian priestesses who initiated young men into sex.
Dr Cig is an expert in the ancient Sumerian civilisation which emerged in Mesopotamia in the third millennia BC.
The issue of headscarves has polarised Turkey in recent years.
Although predominantly Muslim, Turkey is a secular state and headscarves are banned in government offices and universities.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, which has roots in political Islam, has unsuccessfully tried to lift the headscarf ban.
It is the first protest of its kind since the latest Palestinian uprising began in September 2000, and it is provoking unprecedented debate in Israel.
Ilan is a 35-year-old reservist and father of two who is disturbed by what it means to be part of an occupying army.
"Last time, just a couple of weeks ago, they were shooting at us and when we shot back there were people who were shooting into taxis they saw, and houses, and people who had nothing to do with the shooting at us.
It is the refusenik reservists, though, that are now being "taken care of".
The army has stripped some of them of their ranks.
But it is wary of the intense media spotlight and is careful not to draw more negative publicity by meting out the ultimate sanction for disobeying orders - prison.
Yesh Gvul, which means There is a Limit, is a small organisation set up by soldiers who didn't want to serve in Lebanon after Israel's 1982 invasion.
The group, which now supports those who refuse to go to the occupied territories, says it knows of several hundred people who have opted out of doing duty in the West Bank and Gaza, since the latest Palestinian uprising began.
About 40 have been jailed for it - all without attracting much attention.
But now that there has been a collective refusal by combat officers it is not easy for either the army or the Israeli public to dismiss.
Most Israelis oppose what they have done, and yet thousands attended a recent demonstration in Tel Aviv, organised by a coalition of left-wing groups whose events over the past year and a half have not drawn more than a handful of people.
It will take a lot more Israelis speaking out to bring change.
Sainsbury's, Barclaycard, Debenhams and BP are hoping that Nectar will be used by 50% of British households, making it the UK's largest loyalty programme.
Nectar points can be collected from more than 1,800 Sainsbury's, Debenhams and BP outlets and with all Barclaycard purchases.
The points will be exchangeable for a wide range of goods and services including shopping, flights, holidays, meals and cinema tickets.
Barclaycard customers can join Nectar immediately and transfer any existing reward card points into the new scheme.
Customers will receive five Nectar points for every one Barclaycard point they currently have.
The existing scheme will continue until the end of the year and customers will have until February 2003 to make a redemption.
In February 2003, if no redemption has been made on the old scheme, old reward points will disappear.
On Sunday BP will no longer issue Premier points and on Monday when you fill up at BP you will earn Nectar points instead.
BP will not transfer Premier points into Nectar points.
Customers will however still be able to redeem BP Premier points until 30 September 2004.
The current Sainsbury reward card will be phased out and over a period of two months people will be encouraged to transfer to Nectar.
After 16 November 2002 the current reward card will no longer work in Sainsbury's.
For every �1 you spend in Sainsbury's you will get two points.
There is currently no time limit on using the old points.
You can redeem Nectar reward points as you could before, against the value of your shopping.
Debenhams do not have an existing loyalty card.
They do however have a store card which is separate and administered by GE Capital.
If you have a store card, you do not collect points on it as it is not connected to Nectar.
You must also join the Nectar scheme to collect points at Debenhams using your storecard.
About 10 families moved to the Civic Centre car park on Station Road in Pershore on Tuesday.
They are protesting about being evicted from their own land in Eckington.
The Rt Rev Dr Peter Selby and the Bishop's Council of Clergy voted on Thursday to urge the council to "recognise the needs of minorities".
The vote, in which lay representatives from across the diocese took part, also asked the council to consider the special needs of the children involved.
The travellers say their eviction from the Eckington site has put 14 children out of school.
The group moved to the car park after spending a short period of time at Abbey Fields in Pershore.
Wychavon District Council has launched legal proceedings to recover possession of the car park.
The authority previously invoked a legal process which saw the Gypsies evicted for developing the site in Eckington without planning permission.
Ian Marshall, head of legal services at the council, has said that "extensive provision" has been made for gypsies over the years.
"The problem we have with these families is that, in the main, they do not have a connection with Worcestershire and have migrated into this area from the south," he said.

The proposed fight has been tentatively scheduled for 4 October at Madison Square Garden.
The 40-year-old Holyfield lost a decision to Chris Byrd for the IBF version of the title last December and injured his shoulder, which resulted in rotator cuff surgery.
Holyfield, speaking from Montgomery, Alabama where he appeared at a fund-raiser for Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, believes a win over Jones Jr would be a formality.
"It's just a matter of time," he said.
The fight became public knowledge after promoter Murad Muhammad bragged that Jones Jr would earn $15m from it.
Muhammad added that Jones Jr would then fight Mike Tyson at the beginning of next year before taking on Lennox Lewis at the end of 2004.
Lewis's next fight will be against Canadian Kirk Johnson on 21 June in Los Angeles.
Jones Jr became the first former middleweight champion in more than a century to win the heavyweight title when he beat John Ruiz in March.
Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey confirmed he had received the offer from Souness to buy the club.
Souness has been out of football since being sacked by the Magpies in February 2006.
He has been linked with a return to management at Crystal Palace but he has instead turned his attentions to a �20m Molineux buy-out - the figure that Hayward recently put on the Championship outfit.
Souness attended Wolves' game against Barnsley at Molineux on New Year's Day as a guest of the club after meeting Moxey on a flight back from Florida.
Earlier this year, Melinda Gates, one of the world's major philanthropists and Today's guest editor this morning, was in London for a conference on family planning at which she shared a platform with the Prime Minister David Cameron.
But neither have accepted that the recession could have a serious effect on their plans, and both claim that they will balance the budget.
Many experts say that both candidates' current policies would lead to a ballooning budget deficit.
The cost of the financial bail-out could double US government borrowing from $455bn (�274bn) this year to nearly $1 trillion next year - a record 7% of GDP.
Nevertheless, both candidates are still promoting their plans for additional spending and further tax cuts.
Mr Obama wants to introduce an emergency stimulus package to help boost the economy, and new investments in energy and infrastructure - as well as tax cuts for everyone earning less than $250,000.
Mr McCain says that he will freeze domestic, non-military spending to balance the budget, but has also proposed large tax cuts.
And both are proposing major changes to improve the healthcare system that could cost hundreds of billions over their first term.
Commentators on both sides of the political spectrum agree that budget constraints are likely to be the biggest difficulty for the next administration.
They add that promises to balance the federal budget are unlikely to be realised as the recession intensifies.
According to the independent Tax Policy Center, both candidates' policies would increase the deficit further.
James Horney of the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, says that the growing size of the federal deficit will make it hard to pass any new spending programmes.
And the conservative Concord Coalition says that both candidates will have to recognise they are not coming into office with a blank slate.
"The next president will confront the reality of real economic and budgetary constraints - not just political ones - on how quickly and vigorously he can push through the agenda he promised while campaigning," says the group, which campaigns on fiscal responsibility.
It is harder to measure spending pledges because both candidates have been non-specific in many areas.
They have both claimed to be able to control Federal spending, Mr Obama by "taking a scalpel" and Mr McCain by eliminating "earmarks" where Congressmen get special projects for their districts.
But it is not clear where the cuts of the scale needed will come from, and the savings would only take effect later, while the tax cuts would come into effect immediately.
The speed of the US economic downturn has outpaced the policy-making process of the campaigns.
In the last few weeks, both Mr McCain and Mr Obama announced additional proposals to help some of the groups hurt by the slowdown, including retired people, homeowners, and the unemployed.
But an analysis of these plans suggest they are unlikely to have a major effect on the recession.
"Most of the proposals are very poorly targeted and would do very little to address the fundamental problems caused by the economic downturn," says Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center.
He suggests that many of the proposals "would do little good and could have unintended and counter-productive side effects".
To deal with the looming recession, Mr Obama has also backed calls from Congressional Democrats for a new economic stimulus package similar to the one-off tax cut plan implemented in July.
In this, he has been backed up by the powerful head of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, who said recently that "consideration of a fiscal package by the Congress at this juncture seems appropriate".
However, neither the rate cuts nor the fiscal stimulus are likely to be enough to avoid a sharp slowdown in the US persisting throughout 2009, according to most economic forecasters.
The US economic crisis has become the focus of worldwide concern.
According to new global polling by Porter Novelli/GlobalNR, citizens of all 15 countries they surveyed, with the exception of China, expect economic conditions to worsen.
And by and large they blame the US for the economic slowdown, with the largest number agreeing in Japan and Germany - and most say that this has tarnished the global image of America.
However, there is a widespread expectation that conditions will improve under a US administration led by Mr Obama.
US private equity house Texas Pacific Group (TPG) has made a last-minute decision to walk away from a deal to provide almost half of the equity.
But leading City institutions have rallied round to provide the capital, says BBC Business editor Robert Peston.
There should be no concerns about B&B's fundamental soundness, bankers say.
TPG had pledged to pay �179m for a 23% stake in the lender.
But it backed away from investing the new money after Moody's, the credit rating agency, announced it was downgrading the debt of B&B.
The rest of the �400m is to come from shareholders in a rights issue.
The city watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, has played a central role in helping to organise what will be seen as an emergency fund-raising, our business editor said.
The institutions behind the rescue are the ones that were behind Clive Cowdery's recent attempt to take control of B&B.
He walked away after he was refused access to B&B's books by the bank's board, led by the chairman, Rod Kent.
"It would have been disastrous for confidence in the bank if new money was not found to replace TPG," said our business editor.
Mr Kent's decision to pin his hopes on TPG now look to have been misplaced, our business editor added.
Observers say that B&B's shares are likely to be hit when trading opens on Friday on the back of the Moody's downgrade.
Under Resolution's plan, the group would have invest �2bn in the banking sector over the next two years, bringing together banks and lenders hit by the credit turmoil to create a "new, larger and stronger bank".
The novel, ostensibly for children but admired by many critics, has been making waves in the past year.
It made the Man Booker Prize longlist in 2003 but, to the surprise of many, failed to make the shortlist.
Booker chairman John Carey protested in exasperation when his fellow judges refused to let him shortlist Haddon's work.
But the novel picked up several other awards, including the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize and the Booktrust Teenage Prize.
Writer Ian McEwan said the book was a "superb achievement" while the Times newspaper said it was one of the most original novels in years.
And writers who named it among their favourite books of the year were Joanne Harris, Peter Carey, Ian Hislop and Nigel Williams.
Haddon, who is best known as a children's author, has said he did not write The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time for children, and saw it as more of a book for adults.
But publishers took the book and released two versions, with one cover aimed at adults and one for teenage readers.
The central character, Christopher Boone, is a 15-year-old with a form of autism, a maths genius who cannot understand the complexities of human behaviour.
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is written in his voice as he sets out on a journey to discover who killed his neighbour's dog.
Despite being warned to keep out of other people's business by his long-suffering father, Christopher will not be distracted from his mission, but by carrying on he opens up dark secrets about his life.
Christopher often sees his own at times bizarre behaviour, such as hating anything yellow or brown and not talking for days, as completely logical, and he rarely focuses on his disability.
It also reveals the difficulties suffered by those around him, who try to remain patient but understandably find the pressure of caring for a special needs child hard to handle.
The book is both painfully funny and moving, as well as convincing and thought-provoking - Christopher's struggles with everyday life are something to be admired.
It is only a short novel, interspersed with illustrations and maths equations, but the reader is able to completely immerse themselves in the eccentric world of Christopher Boone.

Scientists warn that, coupled with the commercial hunting of gorillas, it may be enough to push them to extinction.
One of the most virulent viruses known, Ebola has killed more than 1,000 people since it was first recorded in 1976.
Ebola causes viral haemorrhagic fever - massive internal and external bleeding - which can kill up to 90% of those infected.
Scientists are still working on a vaccine and there is no known cure.
The latest study, carried out by an international team, has confirmed previous concerns about how badly the virus is affecting gorillas.
In 2002 and 2003, several outbreaks of Ebola flared up in human populations in Gabon and Congo.
The researchers found a "massive die-off" in gorillas in Congo's Lossi Sanctuary between 2002 and 2004.
The researchers concluded that the apes were not only infected by other species, such as fruit bats, but were also transmitting the virus among themselves.
Ebola was passing from group to group of the endangered animals, they found, and appeared to be spreading faster than in humans.
Outbreaks of the disease in humans have sometimes been traced to the bushmeat trade.
According to World Health Organization figures, Ebola killed 1,200 people between the first recorded human outbreak in 1976 and 2004.
The unit costs an estimated �12m a year to run, but managed to recover only �8m from absent parents last year.
The Department for Work and Pensions said the �8m figure was only "the tip of the iceberg".
It represented what was collected through initial contact with parents and did not include what they would pay in future, a spokeswoman said.
The figures emerged after a parliamentary question from shadow work and pensions secretary Paul Goodman.
Mr Goodman said the CSA was "in a mess" and demanded an urgent statement on its future from ministers.
The CSA recovers maintenance from absent parents for the upkeep of their children.
It can retrieve unpaid child maintenance from absent parents in a number of ways - by taking court action against debtors, using bailiffs, and on occasion confiscating driving licences.
But it has come under repeated fire since it was set up in 1993, with Tony Blair admitting recently it was "not suited to the job".
Three weeks ago, the prime minister told MPs it was "extremely difficult" to make the CSA - an investigating, adjudicating and enforcement agency all in one - cost-effective.
Suggestions the government was planning to scrap the agency were played down by Downing Street.
BBC political correspondent Norman Smith says officials believe improving the work of the enforcement unit is central to the agency's future.
A review of the agency is being carried out by its chief executive Stephen Geraghty and is due to report at the end of this year or early in 2006.
If he were prime minister, Isaac would ban guns.
The 34-year-old, a footballer renowned for his skills, has been criticised for not being physical enough for the rigours of modern-day Test rugby.
Williams admits open-side deputy Sam Warburton is giving him the greatest competition for the number seven jersey he has had for many years.
Wales' double Grand Slam winner has been hailed by All Black star Richie McCaw, currently world rugby's finest flanker, as the New Zealander held the Welshman up as a standard-bearer for European open-sides.
Williams became Wales' most-capped Test forward when he captained Wales to a 27-12 defeat to Triple Crown-chasing Ireland in Dublin on Saturday.
But critics have called for the British and Irish Lions star to go from skipper to subs bench inside a week for Saturday's final and meaningless Six Nations clash when Italy visit Cardiff.
"Sam is pushing me as hard as anyone has and he is going to be a world-class player," said Williams.
Why Williams should be dropped for Italy clash - Jones
"The flak is always the case especially when you start losing, it is a fine line.
The Cardiff Blues player is a stranger to criticism as he has been one of coach Warren Gatland's most important Wales players since the New Zealander took over in 2008.
One of Gatland's first jobs was to persuade Williams to come out of international retirement and that proved a masterstroke as he helped himself and his country to a second Grand Slam in four years in 2008.
Then Gatland outlined his plans to wrap the veteran forward in cotton wool to ensure he is able to play on until the 2011 World Cup.
The 95-capped forward, who made his Wales debut against the Barbarians way back in 1996, is closing in on becoming just the second Welshman to win 100 Test caps and join an elite club of centurion rugby players.
He is renowned for his silky footballing skills and handling ability, but the physical and confrontational demands of 21st century rugby means his unique and attractive style of open-side play is not as effective as it once was.
Warburton, who has impressed when he stood in for Williams for the Blues this season, is a more physical open-side and former Wales flanker Gwyn Jones has urged Gatland to choose the 21-year-old rookie over Williams for Wales' match with Italy.
"The game is getting more mechanical and the opportunities for Martyn to have an influence on the game seem to be getting less," Jones told BBC Wales' Scrum V show.
"Because the rest of the back row and the pack are struggling in the physical confrontations, his responsibility to be more confrontational and to win the contact areas are greater again.
"Martyn still is a wonderful player but the way the game is being played and the way we are playing at the moment, perhaps we need a more physical seven.
The Briton, seeded fifth, won 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-1 7-6 (7-2) to set up a final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday.
Murray produced an error-strewn performance in the face of Spaniard Ferrer's class and relentless energy.
But he battled back from the brink of a two-set deficit and is now one win away from a first Grand Slam title.
Serve was dominant in a low-key start to the match, with Murray misfiring a little on his groundstrokes, but the first opportunity for either man came when he got to deuce at 3-3 with some attacking returns, and Ferrer faltered with forehand and backhand errors.
Murray had his break without having got out of first gear but immediately found himself under pressure at 15-40 in the following game as Ferrer stepped up the pace, and the seventh seed clinched it by ending a magnificent rally at the net.
The match had now come alive and a beautiful backhand down the line took Murray to 15-30 in the next game before a similar stroke at the end of a hypnotic 40-shot rally earned him another two break points, but a Ferrer ace and a snatched return into the net saw the Spaniard escape.
Murray now carried the pressure and when Ferrer earned himself a set point, the world number five blazed a forehand wide - his 16th unforced error - to lose a set he had earlier controlled.
The subdued Briton needed a lift and he got exactly that at the start of the second, breaking when Ferrer sent a forehand long, but it did not signal a change in the rhythm of the match as the exasperated Murray found himself 0-40 down moments later and netted a backhand on the third break point.
As the second set progressed, it was the Spaniard who increasingly looked in command as a bewildered Murray just could not find a way through his defences and time after time ended lengthy rallies with a mistake of his own.
Clearly rattled by the way the match was going, and in regular dialogue with the umpire, Murray was in deep trouble at 15-40 in game seven of the second set but served his way out of trouble.
I had to switch to plan B - Murray
The errors kept on coming though and Murray was staring at a two-set deficit as Ferrer, 5-4 up and bristling with intent, hammered an attacking return at 30-30 to force error number 32, but Murray saw off the set point with a big serve down the middle and clung on.
Finally, Ferrer showed a crack in his armour after seeing that opportunity slip by and, at break point down in the following game, he surprisingly netted a mid-court backhand after easily chasing down a Murray drop shot.
Murray now had his chance to get right back in the match but he could not capitalise, failing to find a first serve from 30-30 and leaking a backhand wide on break point, and having dropped serve immediately after breaking for the third time in the match, the signs looked very ominous going into the tie-break.
The Scot required a serious step-up in quality and he produced it, opening with a fizzing return and racing to a 6-0 lead before converting his third set point to get back on level terms after two hours of largely desperate stuff.
Ferrer remained the aggressor as the crucial third set began, dominating Murray's second serve, but two break points went begging at 1-1 when he clipped the tape with an attempted pass before Murray sent down an ace on the second.
With his normally trusty backhand malfunctioning, Murray hit through a couple of heavy forehands down the line to grab the momentum in game four and a fierce return saw him break for 3-1, before a magnificent forehand lob sealed the double break in game six.
Murray closed out the set after seeing off five break points, and the momentum shift was well and truly established when a magical backhand winner from out wide helped him break to love at the start of the fourth.
When Ferrer faced a break point at 2-0 down his challenge appeared almost over but he survived, and the value of that hold was immediately obvious as Murray's purple patch came to an end and the Spaniard broke back to love for 2-2.
A tense set ebbed and flowed without offering up any further break points and, looking to avoid the dreaded fifth set, Murray again opened the tie-break impressively by winning the first three points on the Ferrer serve.
An ace from Murray gave him a 5-1 lead at the changeover and, after three hours and 45 minutes, a neat half-volley took him through to a third Grand Slam final.
Murray revealed afterwards that he had not known the score when he saved the vital set point in the second set.
Sculptor Anish Kapoor has described the detention of Ai Weiwei as "barbaric" and is dedicating a new monumental art installation in Paris to the Chinese artist, who is known to be held by Chinese authorities on charges of economic crimes.
Speaking to Today presenter Justin Webb he said the art would should do more to campaign for his release, and described the fact that he had not been able to defend himself against the allegations as "ridiculous".
The court is the world's first permanent institution with responsibility for trying war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Mr Moreno Ocampo, 50, first came to public attention in 1985, when as a young criminal lawyer, he was deputy public prosecutor in the trial for human rights abuses of former members of Argentina's military government.
They were convicted but later released under an amnesty by President Carlos Menem.
Mr Moreno Ocampo has always been willing to take on the rich and powerful in Argentina, prosecuting military officers responsible for the invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982, and campaigning against corruption.
His law firm currently advises businesses on ethical practices.
He has also defended some controversial figures, including the footballer Diego Maradonna, the former economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, and a priest accused of sexually abusing minors.
He is currently a visiting law professor at Harvard University in the United States.
As prosecutor of the ICC, Mr Moreno Ocampo will be the public face of a new institution which has received strong backing from many countries, but which has been shunned by the United States.
More than 200 complaints have already been registered with the court.
It will only be able to take on cases when no national court is willing or able to do so.
Usually he gets a steady stream of drop-in customers all day.
But for the last four days, revenues have halved.
"Not many people want to come into the shop", he says.
What was once one of the noisiest, dirtiest, busiest places in the world, has become strangely sterile - a quiet city, where many people wear masks outdoors, and most don't go out.
This mutation is costing a fortune.
In Mexico City alone, the mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, has put the figure at $88m (£59m) a day.
But how much will swine flu hit the wider Mexican economy?
Tourism, which represents 8% of Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP), is the sector which will inevitably be hardest hit.
In the current environment, most people see little incentive to visit Mexico, and plenty of reason to leave.
The Mexican government has lobbied hard behind the scenes to prevent its borders being closed, or any formal quarantine being imposed.
But other governments and airlines are beginning to apply their own restrictions.
The real cost of swine flu depends on how long this crisis lasts.
The timing could hardly be worse.
Mexico is already in the midst of a complex and disruptive drug war, and is being hit hard by the global recession.
"The hope was that the economy would stabilise in the second quarter and then improve, but it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year'' says Damian Fraser, Latin America equity strategist at UBS.
Another concern is how far the swine flu might hit the US economy.
Mexico sends 80% of its exports to the United States, and in the event the virus has economic repercussions there, matters will only get worse here.
Unemployment could be the most striking consequence.
Mexican economist Rogelio Ramires - from consultancy firm Ecanal - believes that a crisis lasting several weeks, together with a prolonged US recession, could result in one in every eight Mexicans losing their jobs.
"We are looking at a very dramatic fall", he says.
The Solicitor General in the Philippines, Romeo de la Cruz, said a 1993 conviction against Mrs Marcos, the widow of the late President Marcos, had been based on an erroneous application of the law.
The land was said to have been leased to Mrs Marcos' organisation at "improperly low rates", but the solicitor general says there is no evidence to prove this.
The land was then sublet to another company at much higher rates.
The Supreme Court has in the past rarely reversed a recommendation from the soliticitor general.
Mrs Marcos, 68, also faces numerous other criminal and civil cases related to the 20-year rule of her husband.
She and her husband have been accused of stealing billions of dollars during his presidency, which lasted until a popular revolt in 1986.
The former president died three years later in exile in Hawaii, his wife remaining free on bail while an appeal was being considered.
Mrs Marcos originally intended to compete in last month's Presidential elections, but later dropped out and called on her supporters to vote for the candidate who eventually won, Joseph Estrada.
President-elect Estrada has indicated he may pardon Mrs Marcos even if the conviction is upheld.
The service was filmed by a US company and shown on South Korean television after being given the green light by the North Korean government.
There are an estimated 3,000-4,000 Roman Catholics in North Korea.
But many Christian analysts believe that churches in North Korea are merely propaganda fronts aimed primarily at appeasing a foreign audience.
"The churches in the capital were created for foreigners, and in no way indicate any degree of religious freedom for the North Korea population," said Elizabeth Batha, International Advocate for the charity Christian Solidarity Worldwide.
According to the BBC correspondent in Seoul, North Korean citizens are taught from birth to show almost religious devotion to the country's ruling dynasty, and there is no tolerance for independent religious activity.
The state media waited until 5 April before finally announcing the death of the pontiff, three days after he died.
"When I first heard about the Pope passing away I was very surprised, although of course I knew already that he had been sick," said Kim Yong-il, a church official at the Chang Chung Church in Pyongyang.
At the church, established in 1988, regular prayer services are held every Sunday.
North Korea does not have any seminaries to train its own priests, and the memorial for the Pope was reportedly celebrated by an ethnic Korean priest from the US.
The North Korean Catholics' Association sent a message of condolence to the Vatican after learning of his death.
It is not clear how many Catholics live in the country, but North Korean authorities put their number at about 4,000, while a government-approved group based on a traditional religious movement allegedly has at least 10 times as many followers.
The data is being used in a giant tax evasion probe in Germany and several other countries including Britain.
The Liechtenstein police said on their website that they are looking for Heinrich Kieber, a 42-year old former employee of LGT Bank.
Police posted a photo of Mr Kieber, showing a balding man with glasses.
The police statement also referred to media reports that Mr Kieber was issued with a new identity and travel documents by German intelligence.
The UK's tax authority, the HMRC, has confirmed it also paid an informant for data regarding UK citizens who have accounts in tax haven Liechtenstein.
Investigators in the US, Australia, Italy, France, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and the Czech Republic are among other countries hunting for taxpayers hiding their money in Liechtenstein.
Authorities in Liechtenstein have condemned the purchase of what it says is confidential bank data.
LGT Treuhand, part controlled by the principality's royal family, claims the list of 1,400 customer names are contained on DVDs that were copied by Mr Kieber in 2002.
The data concerns about 1,400 clients, with close to half resident in Germany, the bank said.
Liechtenstein's ruler - Crown Prince Alois - has also argued that Germany's investigation is illegal.
But German prosecutors say their investigation has so far netted 163 people and led to the recovery of more than 27m euros in tax revenue.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development lists Liechtenstein as one of only three states remaining on its blacklist of "uncooperative tax havens".
The 10-date tour will visit a string of British universities in May.
It is being organised with the help of the Stop The Violence charity and Raw Talent, a Nottingham-based youth collective.
Duane Watson, the director and founder of Raw Talent said they would be releasing a single for Stop the Violence on 28 April, adding they wanted to release a series of singles with big names.
The event comes after January's double-shooting of teenagers Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17, at a New Year's Eve party in Birmingham.
"It is a 10-date tour with the cream of British urban music, and it's something that is really positive," said a tour spokesman.
"It's really important because after the shootings several ministers, including Kim Howells, were making accusations against urban music and rap music, and how it made a negative impact on youth culture.
The tour starts on 2 May at Hull University and ends on 16 May in Preston.
Also on the road with Ms Dynamite will be urban artists Moss, Tubby T, Fallacy, Ms Scarlet and Kwame Kwatan.
In January, Ms Dynamite played at the memorial concert for Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare.
She called for black people to "start loving instead of killing each other" in a poem she read out to an 8,000-strong audience at the concert.
Lisa Maffia's group So Solid Crew, the pioneers of Britain's garage music scene, have met with stinging attacks for their music, which has been accused of promoting and glorifying violence.
However the group have said they "abhor violence and have made it clear on their record that they want the violence to stop".
The Total Film magazine poll features an eclectic top 10 marrying modern and traditional classics such as The Third Man, Life of Brian and Trainspotting.
A Matter of Life and Death, starring David Niven, came second in the poll.
However, surprising absences includeOscar winners The English Patient, Chariots of Fire and Gandhi.
Danny Boyle's 1996 cult classic Trainspotting, in third place, was the most recently made film in the top 10, in a list which favoured films made in the 1950s and 1960s.
Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) featured in 26th place, but there was no mention of recent comedy hits The Full Monty or Bridget Jones's Diary.
In the film, which underwent a poorly received Hollywood remake in 2000, Caine plays a ruthless gangster seeking revenge for the death of his brother.
Aside from Get Carter, Caine, 71, stars in three further films in the top 50, namely Zulu, The Italian Job and Alfie - recently remade with Jude Law in the title role and due for release in the UK later this month.
"Although the industry is not as strong as it used to be, the poll shows that Britain is still making amazing movies," said Mr Mueller.
The full list will feature in this month's Total Film magazine.
It is reported that more than 800 people have been killed in an escalating conflict which originally spilt over from neighbouring Chechnya six years ago.
Ingushetia is a tiny region with a total population of just 300,000.
"A lot of my human rights colleagues and politicians say it is now a civil war and I agree with that," Magomed Mutsolgov, director of the Ingush Human Rights organisation Mashr, says.
A low-level insurgency involving Muslim fighters escalated dramatically last year with a surge of attacks on the security forces and also on people who have moved into the region from other parts of Russia.
Moscow's response has been heavy-handed, with reports that an extra 2,500 troops from outside Ingushetia were deployed in the republic last year to help crush what Russia sees as a Muslim rebellion.
But this has only added fuel to the fire which is driving ever more young Ingush men into the arms of the rebels.
The military and other security services including the FSB, the successor to the KGB, have long stood accused of committing gross human rights violations against the Ingush population - such as kidnapping and torture.
But last year, according to Human Rights Watch, the security forces were also responsible for a wave of extra-judicial killings.
Human Rights Watch says 40 people were killed without any proof they had anything to do with the insurgency.
On a dirt track on the outskirts of the main town, Nazran, Jamaldin Gardanov showed me the spot where he says his brother Hamzat was shot through the head by a Russian soldier in August.
He told me Hamzat had been driving home with his cousin after buying some paint in town.
"My brother and his cousin were passing a checkpoint set up after a policeman was killed on the main road," he said.
"The car turned down here (into the dirt track) and the security forces opened fire with intent to kill.
Over lunch he showed me photographs of a raid on his house by Russian soldiers at the beginning of this month.
One of the pictures shows a young child standing outside the house in front of an armoured personnel carrier.
"My wife and children were standing outside for three hours as they searched our house," he said.
Video appears to show Russian soldiers pulling bodies from a car
Jamaldin does come from a family of theologians and is deeply religious, but he strongly denies any links to radical Islam.
"The security forces have created the threat of Wahhabism as a cover for what they are doing here," he said.
He then showed us some shocking clips of video stored on his mobile phone.
In the first we could see a close-up of a man's head covered in blood.
The second mobile phone video shows the incident, which happened in the centre of Nazran, in February last year.
It was filmed by someone inside the main administration building, looking down on the square where Adam and a friend had been sitting in a car.
The video shows what looks very much like a soldier pulling the bodies from the vehicle.
Jamaldin says the prosecutor told him off the record that his brother Adam was "absolutely clean", there was no reason for him to have been killed.
The family believes Adam may have been targeted simply because he was a devout Muslim who had studied in Egypt.
Later, in a safe location, we met up with another victim of the security forces' dirty war in Ingushetia.
23-year-old Tamerlan could barely get out of the car when he arrived at our meeting-point.
He had just been released after being detained for six days by the security forces in the northern town of Maglobek.
He had been picked up with three friends following the murder of a policeman in the town.
When we got inside, he pulled up his jumper to reveal a cluster of deep bruises and cuts around his lower back.
He said he was also badly bruised on his upper thighs and he had marks on his wrists.
"They tortured me from six in the morning to six in the evening," he said.
He says the security forces were trying to get him to confess to involvement in the policeman's murder but had to release him because he knew nothing about it.
He told me he had no connection with the rebels.
"Maybe they detained me because I'm a Muslim and pray at the Mosque and my wife wears the Hijab," he said.
According to the mainstream opposition leader Maksharip Aushev, this brutal treatment of the local population is not only swelling the ranks of the rebel fighters.
"People are coming to me all the time, saying let's vote for independence," he says.
"If we had a referendum, 80% of the population would vote to leave Russia," he adds.
In a sign of mounting panic back in Moscow, the Kremlin suddenly announced three weeks ago that the former KGB officer Murat Zyazikov, who had been in charge of Ingushetia since 2002, was being replaced.
The new man is a career soldier, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, who made his name during the wars in Chechnya.
He turned down our request for an interview.
The most senior politician in the region who was prepared to speak to us was the chairman of the local parliament's security committee, Mukhtar Buzurtanov.
He said Yunus-Bek Yevkurov must bring the security forces under control and stop what he called their "illegal activities".
But he also accused the rebels of trying to destabilise Russia, saying they were part of a radical Islamic movement which had moved into Ingushetia after the wars in Chechnya.
He added that more than 50 soldiers had been killed so far this year.
Other senior officials in the local government have been quoted as saying they have to mount security operations to eliminate the rebels because of the threat they pose to Moscow's rule over the region.
The arrival of a new leader of Ingushetia who is a battle-hardened soldier and veteran of the Chechen conflict may sound ominous.
But the top opposition politician Maksharip Aushev holds out some hope that Yunus-Bek Yevkurov could improve the situation.
So far there have not been any signs of change and the violence and abuses have continued.
"We will give [Mr Yevkurov] a maximum of three months," Mr Aushev says.
Fourteen young people from Belarus are coming to the island in the summer on a trip organised by the Chernobyl Children Lifeline Guernsey Link.
During their four-week stay the group will enjoy various events, including a trip to the island's schools, as well as fun days at the beach.
The children are all victims of the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.
The Chernobyl plant was the scene of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident in April 1986, when its number four reactor exploded.
Groups of young victims have been making the tip from Belarus to the Bailiwick since 1993.
The children stay with host families, but one more home is needed from 5 June for a month.
The nice people who run the Middle East section of the BBC News website once told me that the ideal length for a diary, such as this, is 500 words.
I was keen to hear what he had to say about the legal status of settlements.
Aharon Barak disagreed with the idea that the Court had been dilatory.
But the argument of "security rationale" prompted a raised eyebrow, along the platform, from Hans Corell.
The cases that the Israeli Supreme Court now hears on settlements tend to focus on whether they have been built illegally on, for example, privately owned Palestinian land.
Staffordshire Police have been using the CCTV drone for the first time at the V Festival site this weekend.
Officers said the remote controlled plane helped capture offenders at the festival site at Weston Park, on the border of Staffordshire and Shropshire.
By Sunday police had arrested 62 people in total at the festival and had cautioned more than 100.
Officers said 32 of those arrested had been found possessing drugs.
The remote control drone was being used particularly in the festival's car park to catch criminals attempting to break into vehicles.
Police said they expected to use the technology at future big events.
"It will work in addition to the CCTV that we will monitor on site throughout the festival.
People travelling to the festival on Friday faced traffic delays of hours because of motorway congestion.
Highways Agency officials were forced to close a slip road on the M6 to help ease the traffic problems.
Last year a Greenpeace coalition bought an acre of land near Sipson village and gave ownership to 60,000 people.
It has invited architects to submit designs for a "fortress" to resist bulldozers, if the runway goes ahead.
The coalition gave ownership of the land to 60,000 people in a bid to create legal obstacles to delay or stop the runway scheme.
It launched a competition to design the "impenetrable fortress", to be built as soon as possible unless the airport expansion is abandoned.
Greenpeace also asked members of the public for ideas how to protect the land, which it bought with groups including the Woodland Trust, the RSPB and World Development Movement.
The best fortress design will be chosen by a panel including sculptor Rachel Whiteread, engineer Professor Neil Thomas and comedian Alistair McGowan.
The former transport secretary Geoff Hoon said last January a new Heathrow runway would create up to 60,000 jobs and would ensure "Britain remains a place where the world can come to do business".
But environmental groups, councils, residents and the RSPB said the expansion would damage wildlife and increase pollution and congestion.
In November last year actors, politicians and Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy planted an orchard on the Greenpeace coalition site.
The decision to shut the pool and sell off the ground has come despite strong opposition from locals who marched through the town in protest.
The council had originally agreed to not close the pool until a new one was built, but has run out of money.
The date for the closure will be decided on later in the month.
The council claims the pool currently costs the tax payer £700,000 per year.
They are in negotiation with the county council as the pool will be incorporated into a district leisure centre
Dr Charles Saunders acknowledged that some doctors and nurses were not being as thorough as they should be in washing their hands between patients.
Dr Saunders, chairman of the BMA's public health committee in Scotland, said this was because staff were having to treat more patients than they should.
His comments came after two unrelated incidents at the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow.
The latter virus has led to the cancellation of operations and forced the closure of the hospital to new admissions.
Dr Saunders said more investment was needed in infection control teams that would reinforce the training which staff had received.
"It's sad that the Scottish Executive doesn't seem to give the same amount of priority to infection control in hospitals as it does to waiting times and waiting lists," he added.
Earlier, Professor Hugh Pennington, of the bacteriology department at Aberdeen University, told BBC Scotland that not enough was being done to tackle the problem.
Health Minister Malcolm Chisholm promised over the weekend that there would be national action to ensure hospitals tackle hygiene issues.
He said a hygiene inspection would take place at every Scottish hospital in the coming weeks.
Professor Pennington said it was likely to be "just bad luck" that the second infection had struck at the Victoria Infirmary.
However, he said he was more concerned with outbreaks such as salmonella which were passed on through individual contact.
"There is a substantial amount of infection in hospitals which is preventable and we are not doing enough about it," he said.
"The key measure - and it is not rocket science - is hand washing.
Professor Pennington said he was more critical of doctors because they had gone through a long and expensive training.
"They know what they should be doing, but when it comes down to the day-to-day they cut corners," he said.
It is a serious condition which attacks the immune system - which is what stops your body from getting ill.
People with Aids can die after developing different kinds of disease which the body would normally fight off by itself.
Ivory Coast striker Drogba, who appeared as a substitute, was given clearance by Fifa after the cast had been examined by the match referee.
Ronaldo calls for more ref protection
Fifa stated on Tuesday that all parties, including match referee Jorge Larrionda of Uruguay and Portuguese team officials, were satisfied that the cast did not pose a danger to other players.
Drogba began the match from the bench before Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson elected to bring the 32-year-old Chelsea striker on for Salomon Kalou in the 65th minute.
Drogba had sustained his arm injury during a friendly against Japan on 4 June, and consequently required surgery.
Meanwhile, Queiroz believes his opposite number Eriksson had set out plans for Ivory Coast to contain Portugal.
"What Eriksson wanted us to do was to take risks so we had to prevent Ivory Coast taking advantage of any errors that we might make," Queiroz stated after the 0-0 draw.
Portugal's next match is against North Korea in Cape Town on Monday 21 June.
Munster have it all to do to qualify fromthis year's pool stage after going down to Perpignan at the Stade Aime Giralon Saturday.
If last season's defeated Heineken Cup finalists lose to Gloucester at Thomond Park next Saturday, they miss out on topping Pool 2.
However, they should go through to the knock-out stages as one of the two best runners-up because of their 23 tries.
Munster coach Alan Gaffney admitted his side had been out-thought andout-fought.
"We thought we had a shot in the first half, but we were very disappointedwith the second half.
''The boys knew what they had to do - we knew what toexpect.
The French side took full advantage of the wind at their backs in the openinghalf, scoring twice in two minutes to take a valuable five-point lead into thebreak.
Perpignan fly-half Manny Edmonds and opposite number Ronan O'Gara swappedpenalties as the teams sorted themselves out early on before the home side movedup a gear.
With Munster captain Jim Williams in the bloodbin, the French side tapped apenalty and drove into Irish territory.
From the ruck, and a neat kick by full-back Jean-MarcSouverbie Frederic Cermeno beat Munster full-backJeremy Staunton to the ball.
Scrum-half Ludovic Loustau set up the his side's second try when he delivered aclever scissor pass to centre partner Giordani, who ran 20 metres untouched toscore.
Munster hit back and camped on the French line for the remainder of the half and deservedly replied with a line-out drive and touchdown by number 8 Anthony Foley.
A piece of strong scrummaging in the 64th minute ruined Munster's day when fresh legs in the front five proved too much for the Munster flanker Gregory Le Corvec dived over.
Munster pressured the Perpignan line but could not come up with the crucial points tosave the match.
Perpignan had the final say, with lock Rimas Alvarez-Kairalis slotting intothe scrum at number eight and driving over in the final minute in a carbon copyof Le Corvec's effort.
Letters have been sent to at least three agencies, including US charity Mercy Corps, the Irish agency Concern, and a British NGO, Acord.
No reason was given for the move, only that they had not met the requirements for operational permits.
At least one in three Eritreans is seriously short of food, as the country suffers from a drought which has hit the whole of the Horn of Africa.
President Isaias Afewerki has repeatedly called on his people to practise self reliance.
"While thanking your organization for the contribution it has made to relief and rehabilitation programs in Eritrea in the past years, the Ministry kindly officially informs you that the registration certificate is recalled and requests the termination of your activities," one of the letters from the Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare says.
The aid agencies say they are hoping to discuss the issue with the government.
But Eritrea has gradually reduced its relations with the entire world community.
The country turned down a crop assessment mission from the United Nation's agencies last year.
Recently Eritrea has clamped down on UN peacekeepers patrolling its border with Ethiopia and expelled Western UN staff.
The neighbours fought a brutal war between 1997-2000 which ended with a peace agreement committing both sides to abide by the ruling of an international tribunal that decided where the border should run.
However, Ethiopia refused to let it be demarcated without further discussion and Eritrea has been urging the international community to put more pressure on Ethiopia to comply with the ruling.
At talks intended to end the deadlock last weekend, the Boundary Commission told both countries it would resume the demarcation process where it left off some years ago.
Planning permission for the laboratory at Girton on the city outskirts was turned down in February.
Cambridgeshire police said the cost of policing animal rights protests would be too high.
But the government's chief scientist David King has stepped in, lending weight to Cambridge University's appeal against the decision.
South Cambridgeshire District Council rejected the plans amid concerns that testing on animals would attract protests like those staged outside the Huntingdon Life Sciences.
A spokesman said it could not guarantee public safety or afford the cost of policing protests at the laboratory, which would use monkeys for testing.
Last year, Cambridgeshire police spent �2m policing animal rights demonstrations.
Professor King told the BBC that funding would be found for a new laboratory in Cambridge researching neural diseases.
"The university remains convinced that this project is vital, and the best site is Huntingdon road.
In February the council's decision to block the plan was described by the university as "deeply damaging".
A spokeswoman said research into such conditions as Alzheimer's, autism and Parkinson's disease would be set back because of the authority's decision.
Professor David King was Master of Downing College, Cambridge, and head of the university's chemistry department when he was brought in by Tony Blair to advise the government on the big scientific issues of the day.
What's her most memorable news story?
Sixty five years ago this weekend, RAF Bomber Command carried out one of the most devastating air raids of World War Two.
Such was the beauty of Dresden that many had thought it inviolable, but towards the end of the war it had become an important target both as a munitions manufacturer and strategically as a communications hub.
War leaders, including Stalin, had requested the attack but the scale of the destruction caused controversy and led to Churchill to refer to "terror" bombing in a memo he later withdrew.
"It will also give great satisfaction to people like myself who are still alive and it's important that we have it erected and unveiled in March and April next year while some of us are still around because we are losing people at a tremendous rate from the POW Association.
Industry experts say retailers enjoyed their best Christmas since 2001 but that holiday sales fizzled out after a strong start.
Many retailers were forced to offer big discounts to boost business in the run-up to Christmas, with some offering up to 20% off goods.
But chief executive Stuart Rose said that M&S had not offered any discounts over the period.
Although its performance was driven by food, Mr Rose said that other areas of the business were also recovering.
"I am very pleased with this set of results but we have a lot more work to do," he added.
Progress had been made in improving stock buying and management, Mr Rose added, with far fewer goods being included in the holiday sales.
However, he warned that market conditions were still "challenging", with costs from fuel, rent and business rates rising sharply.
Analysts said the retailer's performance was in line with expectations, reflecting the fact that it did not discount on clothing before Christmas.
Richard Ratner, head of research at Seymour Pierce, said that excluding food, many retailers had only boosted sales through heavy discounting.
He also expressed caution about general retail prospects for 2006.
"We think life will now become very difficult," he told the BBC.
ICA artistic director Ekow Eshun said the initiative was "putting art and culture directly in people's hands".
Arts minister David Lammy said the scheme could represent "a pivotal development for culture in the UK".
The next instalment, available in a fortnight's time, will showcase the comic-book film V for Vendetta and profile the animator Rex.
Sarah Weir, executive director of Arts Council England, said the partnership with Sony's PSP format would allow the ICA "to develop a new and lasting relationship with a community of visually aware young opinion formers".
Last year the PSP became Britain's fastest-selling games console, with more than 185,000 units sold in its first four days in UK shops.
The subscription channel FilmFour will screen Romance, which features a range of sexual acts, in a film season called Extreme Cinema.
The channel will also broadcast Ai No Corrida, a controversial Japanese film which has scenes of castration.
John Beyer, of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association has condemned Channel 4 and claims television standards are being threatened.
Romance, directed by Catherine Breillat, is the tale of 20-something Marie's erotic odyssey through Paris after she is spurned by her boyfriend.
The film features real-life Italian porn star Rocco Siffredi and shows a erect penis for the first time in a general cinema release.
"These are not being shown on Channel 4 but FilmFour and viewers must be 18-plus to subscribe.
Channel 4 and FilmFour have courted controversy of late, announcing a series of films which have been refused certificates in the past.
Erotic film The Story of O and horror movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are to be screened on FilmFour and Channel 4 respectively.
A spokeswoman for TV regulator the Independent Television Commission pointed out there was no bar to screening the films as they have been given 18-certificates.
"All the research has shown that the public are more relaxed about sexual portrayal as long as they know when it is going to be appearing," she said.
But that suggestion appeared to be rejected by election commission head JM Lyngdoh during a visit to Indian-administered Kashmir with two colleagues to assess the region's preparedness for the poll.
"As far as we know, we are all set to hold elections as per schedule," he said.
Separatist leaders are calling for a boycott of the poll and militant groups fighting against Indian rule have warned people not to take part.
The chief election commissioner said the local administration and security forces were confident they could provide all the necessary security arrangements for the event.
Delhi has already commissioned additional paramilitary troops for the elections.
The state's chief electoral officer, Pramod Jain, said the election commission was in the process of inducting 5,000 polling staff from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to supplement those already present in the state.
He said the commission was ensuring that at least half the staff at every polling station were not from Kashmir.
He said this would help to ensure that polls were conducted in a free and fair manner.
The commission has issued 600,000 voter identity cards in the state so far.
The state has around six million voters.
There have been some allegations that the security forces have been coercing local people to obtaining voter identity cards.
But the authorities deny the charge
The electoral officers are spending three days meeting senior civil and security officials and politicians to try to make a final assessment as to whether free and fair elections can be held.
Meanwhile, a group of Indian academics and journalists says it is disappointed not to have persuaded a leading Kashmiri separatist alliance, the Hurriyat Conference, to take part in the forthcoming elections.
The announcement came at the end of a three-day tour of the Kashmir Valley by the so-called Kashmir Committee.
Its leader, former Indian Law Minister Ram Jethmalani, said, however, that he was happy the Hurriyat Conference had agreed to keep talking to his group.
The Kashmir Committee was set up last month as a fresh initiative to find a peaceful resolution to a dispute which has seen nuclear rivals India and Pakistan mobilise a million troops.
HTC has been accused of infringing 20 patents owned by Apple that are used in the iPhone.
HTC makes phones for many firms including Google and was behind the Nexus One handset.
In its legal filing, Apple is seeking a lasting injunction which would effectively bar HTC from selling phones that use the disputed technology in the US.
The legal action has been filed with the US International Trade Commission and a district court in Delaware.
In its response to the legal action, HTC said it had only just learned about Apple's legal action and has not had the chance to investigate the filing.
"Until we have had this opportunity, we are unable to comment on the validity of the claims being made against HTC," it said in a statement.
In addition to making the Nexus One, the first handset to be branded by Google, HTC has also made several handsets that use Google's Android operating system.

Groups of these vicunas, relatives of llamas, are now back in South America thanks to lots of work by conservationists.
This wild black-footed ferret of America was once extinct in the wild, but it was bred in captivity and has now been returned to it's natural habitat.
Thanks to other conservation projects, this Przewalski's horse has also made a return to the wild in Mongolia, a country in Asia.
And numbers of humpback whales have increased quickly after people were banned from killing them to make money from their meat.
There's still a way to go for these Kihansi spray toads who are slowly being reintroduced into the wild.
These midwife toads also have a bright future, but despite these success stories, more than 50 species move closer to extinction each year.
Roman mosaics, hidden for centuries at Chedworth Roman Villa, are to be put on permanent display as part of a major �3million project to develop the villa.
The mosaics were unveiled to the public on Tuesday, 27th July, 2010 when local schools and community groups were invited to the villa to join the celebrations and meet the archaeologists involved.
"Our archaeologists have known these mosaics existed on site since they were first seen during the Victorian excavations but later re-buried," said Pippa Wise, Chedworth programme officer.
Adele will be at his side throughout the World championships in Mexico, taking pictures and reporting back.

Pure determination has kept Suraya going for the past 24 hours and she collapses exhausted on the bed.
I go down to the race track and watch the athletes being given their medical assessments.
In the afternoon I take a trip with the 'wags', Arthur's wife Mary, and Angela, the wife of Peter Cusick, another British competitor.
We go to the local supermarket where they both stock up on energy supplies for their husbands.
For Arthur it's ice cream, jam, bread and butter, I buy some much needed, and well missed chocolate.
When we get back to the race site I find out that a couple more of the athletes have dropped out.
One man says he can't complete anymore Ironmans, and most of the others have stomach problems.
Speaking of ducks, most of them were removed yesterday in cages from the Olympic village, however it seems like they've missed a few.
Suraya believes one of them ate her lap timer.
As the sun goes down the athletes carry on their cycles and marathons.
It seems every day they're taking longer and longer to complete the Ironmans as they become more and more tired.
The athletes make their way to the Olympic pool where Arthur starts his swim.
I stick around to take photographs of Arthur in action and then head off to the 11 storey principal building owned by the University of Nuevo Leon, in Monterrey.
It's on the roof of this building where I am broadcasting live on BBC Tees.
Luckily I have made a Mexican friend, Ray, who translates everything for me and helps me up on to the roof.
The views of the city and the mountains are incredible and you can see for hundreds of miles.
I am up and running with the satellite and manage to speak to BBC Tees' Jamie Wilkinson, around midday in Mexico, and nearly 6pm in Middlesbrough.
The highlight of my day was getting asked for my autograph at the side of the race track by an old Mexican man with a moustache.
I thought he wanted to borrow my pen!
Maybe he's got me confused with someone famous!
After a bit of sunbathing and some pasta, cooked by Lucia in the 24 hour restaurant at the Olympic village, I check up on Arthur's progress.
At around 3pm Arthur is steaming ahead, he's actually beating most of the other competitors on the cycle stint.
The statistics board shows he's averaging at around six minutes a lap.
Today two people are out of the event, the Swiss man who broke his collar bone on the first day, and a German man who has stomach problems.
All athletes are up at 6am to be given a medical assessment on the first day of the Ultra Triathlons.
Me? I stay in bed an extra hour and build up the energy to go and have some breakfast.
Everyone sets off on their special bicycles to travel to the Olympic swimming pool but I manage to get a lift in a car (I have a lot of bags).
Mary and Arthur have devised a system - Arthur can be given drinks and snacks without having to slow down his cycling.
The leading competitor, Beat Knechtle from Switzerland, crashes into a duck which has wandered onto the track.
He has a broken collar bone, and is out of the race, which is unfortunate as he was winning.
Arthur finishes the 112 mile cycle stint in around 4 hours 41 minutes, his second best ever time.
After more than 40 hours travelling to Monterrey, I arrived in the blazing sunshine of 27 degrees.
From the airport I went straight to the "pasta party", where the competitors fill up on carbs and calories.
They feasted on profiteroles, pastries, cream cakes, paella, fajitas, vegetables, and salads.
Needless to say, Arthur and I gorged ourselves.
He managed three plates piled high, and I sadly only managed two.
While the athletes stuffed their faces there was authentic Mexican entertainment, trumpets, guitars, and a bit of dancing.
And thought the wine and beer was flowing, alas, for Arthur and I, we were too professional to indulge!
A tour of the facilities followed the pasta party - we were taken to the Olympic swimming pool, and the cycle and running track.
Baby, normally a centre, gets the nod over Francois Trinh-Duc, while Morgan Parra comes in at scrum-half for the benched Sebastien Tillous-Borde.
Trinh-Duc starts on the bench, while Mathieu Bastareaud is handed a debut at centre alongside Yannick Jauzion.
Maxime Medard reverts to full-back and Sebastien Chabal is recalled at lock.
Sale Sharks favourite Chabal returns in place of Romain Millo-Chluski, who drops to the bench.
Elsewhere in the forwards Sylvain Marconnet is drafted into the front row and will make his 72nd appearance for France, equalling the prop record held by Christian Califano.
The Stade Francais veteran was called into the squad last week as a result of injuries suffered by Nicolas Mas and Benoit Lecouls.
Among the backs, Medard's reversion to full-back in place of Toulouse team-mate Clement Poitrenaud sees Julien Malzieu coming in on the wing.
In all there are five personnel changes to the team which started the 22-13 win over Scotland a week and a half ago.
Les Bleus lost their first match of the tournament 30-21 to Ireland in Dublin.
Trinh-Duc was called up on Monday as a replacement for the injured Lionel Beauxis, while Bastareaud also got the call thanks to an injury to Maxime Mermoz.
Defence will be the key - Harinordoquy
Lievremont had been expected to send for Toulouse fly-half David Skrela, but instead went for 22-year-old Trinh-Duc.
But although the Montpellier youngster is on the bench, Lievremont's choice of Baby and Parra as his starting half-backs means Les Bleus will go into the Stade de France encounter without a specialist goalkicker.
Parra will take over kicking duties, something he has done only once before - against England in last year's Six Nations when he was successful with his only attempt.
Lievremont insisted he was left with no choice but to go with Baby after seeing first-choice fly-half Beauxis injure his back while playing for Stade Francais against Toulon in the Top 14 last Friday.
The hulking Bastareaud, 20, has been in superb form for Stade Francais this season, his rampaging and aggressive style of play making him a firm fans' favourite.
"We had to choose [who to call up] between Mathieu Bastareaud and Damien Traille, but Traille is ill and only played an hour [for his club at the weekend] while Florian Fritz is still suspended," said Lievremont.
Bastareaud was called up by Les Bleus in 2007 for the summer tour to New Zealand but had to pull out because of a knee injury.
Centre Fritz remains suspended after picking up a three-week ban after being cited for alleged eye gouging in their opening game against Ireland, which France lost 30-21 in Dublin.
Anonymity could be granted to defendants in rape trials under new government legislation.
Campaigners say the changes are unnecessary and that the government should concentrate on improving the conviction rate in rape cases.
Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, a Labour peer and barrister, examines how the changes will affect rape trials.
Mr Dombrovskis, who is a member of the European Parliament, is from the main centre-right opposition party, New Era.
After being nominated, Mr Dombrovskis warned that Latvia was "on the verge of bankruptcy" and would need to make budget cuts or risk financial collapse.
Ivars Godmanis resigned as PM last week amid protests at the economic crisis.
Latvia's economy is in recession and is expected to contract by up to 12% in 2009, with unemployment rising by 50%.
"I wish Valdis Dombrovskis luck," Mr Zatlers said on Thursday.
Mr Godmanis, a member of the small Latvia's First/Latvia's Way party, resigned on Friday after losing the support of his two main coalition partners - the People's Party and the Union of Greens and Farmers.
His government had come in for strong criticism over its handling of the economic crisis.
As part of the deal it has had to cut public spending and increase taxes - both unpopular policies.
A protest in the capital, Riga, on 13 January ended in more than 100 arrests and more than 40 injuries.
"The previous government hasn't fulfilled its obligations under the agreement with the IMF," he told reporters in Riga.
Takeover speculation had been swirling around BOC since January, when Linde tabled an offer of �15 a share that was rejected by BOC's board as too low.
The deal went ahead after Linde raised its offer to �16 a share, a sum BOC said was good value for shareholders.
Linde was "delighted" at the deal and said the firms were "a perfect match".
While Linde is based in Germany, it employs about 60% of its 41,000 staff outside of the country and has UK sites in places including Basingstoke, West Bromwich, Aldershot and Merthyr Tydfil.
BOC employs 30,000 people and has two million customers in 50 countries.
At the same time, airport group BAA is being stalked by a Spanish suitor.
Drake, who died aged 26 in 1974, is regarded as one of the most influential acoustic songwriters in British music.
"I was introduced to Nick Drake's music about five years ago, and am a huge admirer of his records," said Pitt.
Lost Boy - In Search Of Nick Drake tells the life story of the celebrated singer, who has influenced many musicians including Norah Jones and REM.
The programme includes Norah Jones's cover of Drake's song Day is Done, recorded in 2001, as well as the airing of a previously 'lost' track, Tow the Line, for the first time.
The track was found during work on a new record of Drake's rare or unreleased work.
The Albanian majority wants Kosovo to break away from Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Jessen-Petersen said he was "shocked and appalled" by Saturday's shooting and urged police "to find the perpetrators of this loathsome crime".
Though governed by the UN, the province is formally still under Belgrade's rule and its final status has yet to be resolved.
A 17,000-strong Nato-led peacekeeping force is deployed in Kosovo.
The poll will now be held on 14 December, a week later than planned.
Parliament was dissolved two weeks ago after the collapse of the country's ruling pro-Western coalition.
But the country has also been badly shaken by the global credit crunch, with markets and the Ukrainian currency tumbling and banks needing propping up.
Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko warned on Monday that Ukraine was heading for stagnation, with global demand falling for its key exports - steel and chemicals - and banks unable to extend consumer credit.
Ms Tymoshenko - once an ally of the president but now a bitter rival - has been calling for the snap elections to be postponed and for parliament to be recalled.
The other main parties had previously ignored those calls.
Lord Haskins said that during the Euro 96 football championships, "when they had some discretion about licensing hours in Manchester there was less trouble when people came out onto the streets".
The report follows comments by Home Office minister George Howarth that the legislation surrounding licensed premises needed to undergo a root and branch reform.
Earlier this year he said the time was right to "blow away the cobwebs in British life by modernising the liquor licensing system".
The report says that "any logic" behind the confusing number of different licences and regulations governing the sale of alcohol on and off licensed premises were not understood by customers.
"The most obvious example of customer confusion or disappointment pointed out to us is the reaction of overseas visitors to our present limitation on opening hours.
"The law appears to bear little relationship to present day social reality," the report says.
Police and courts have expressed worries that town centres become "flashpoints" as hordes of drinkers pour onto the streets.
At present the 160,000 licensed premises in England and Wales apply to 350 local licensing magistrates to trade in liquor, but the study proposes that local authorities take charge, allowing greater accountability and transparency.
The report also calls for the current requirement for "fit and proper" licensees to become a nationally standardised.
As for the under age drinking limit the task force, who consulted with industry and consumer groups in their study, says there should be no change.
In July, Culture Secretary Chris Smith ended 15 years of wrangling when he approved the proposal to take traffic away from the site.
The idea is to close the A344 trunk road that runs to the north and bury the A303 trunk road that runs to the south in a shallow, 2km-long 'cut and cover' tunnel.
But opponents claim that English Heritage has caved in to political pressure and is building a 'cut and cover' tunnel costing �120m to save money.
A deep bore tunnel passing well below the Wiltshire site would cost �300m by comparison.
Archaeologists argue that the 'cut and cover' tunnel will damage the wealth of other stone age features that surround Stonehenge, while a deep bore tunnel is the only solution that will not disturb the monuments.
English Heritage, which is responsible for the development of the site, said the tunnel will cause "minimal damage".
The Treasury is only funding two-thirds of the project and Mr Smith has still to find the remaining finance.
Even if he succeeds, he still has to put the tunnel project and a plan for a badly-needed new visitors' centre before a planning inquiry, which could decide to throw them out.
Mr Smith travelled to Wiltshire on Tuesday to consult with local government representatives and interest groups in an attempt to bolster support for the plan.
Stonehenge is a World Heritage site, placing it on a par with the Great Wall of China and the pyramids at Giza, in Egypt.
Opinion is divided, but most authorities date the construction of the final phase of Stonehenge to between 3000 and 1600 BC, possibly predating monuments like the Egyptian Sphinx.
Archaeologists have also failed to agree on how the heavy stones were transported from as far away as the Preseli Mountains in south Wales.
It is a feat of engineering that suggests a highly-organised and sophisticated society.
Stonehenge was the last of a series of circular structures on the same site aligned to the rising sun at the midsummer solstice.
Its purpose is unknown, although it has been suggested the site performed the function of a giant calendar.
Its mysterious origins have made it a gathering place for druids and other groups who celebrate the summer solstice.
Mousie disappeared while owner Ira Bauert was on a caravan holiday in north Devon last September.
The cat turned up six months later and was cared for by Diana Lewis from North Devon Animal Ambulance, who discovered it had been micro-chipped in Germany.
The owner was traced after an appeal to rehome Mousie was spotted by Cats Protection - to which Frau Bauert had reported her cat missing.
"It was just one of those amazing coincidences," Ms Lewis told BBC News.
The long journey home began when the animal collection officer received a call from the Twitchen Holiday Park in March about a very thin stray cat with an injured leg.
"I collected it and took it to the vet for treatment and that's when we discovered it had a very unusual microchip," Ms Lewis said.
After contacting the pet microchip database in London, Ms Lewis was told the cat was registered in Germany.
"I nicknamed it Herman the German and set about trying to track the owner down," Ms Lewis said.
She contacted Trading Standards and the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
"I was told to contain the cat and keep it in isolation while Defra tried to trace it, but they were unable to.
Ms Lewis put an article in the North Devon Journal saying Herman the German desperately needed a new home and within hours was contacted by Cats Protection who had taken a report of a missing cat last September.
The league had the owner's phone number, so Ms Lewis contacted her by text and received a "very emotional" phone call from Frau Bauert, who said she would return to Britain immediately.
"She barely recognised the cat because she's so fat from lying about in a cage for so long, but she's a very happy and very lucky owner," Ms Lewis said.
Danish company Vestas Windsystems announced in April it would close its turbine plant on the island, cutting 600 jobs, despite rising profits.
It said it would close its factory in Newport due to reduced demand for wind turbines in northern Europe.
On Saturday campaigners met in St James' Square in the town.
They gathered support and collected signatures for a petition against the planned closure.
The factory is set to shut at the end of July with the loss of 525 jobs at the blade manufacturing and research plant at Newport and a further 100 in Southampton.
"It's absolutely criminal for the only manufacturer of wind turbines in the country to consider closing in the middle of an economic recession when unemployment is rising and jobs are going everywhere.
"If people are laid off here on the island they're really going to struggle to find any alternative work.
"It is also criminal - given we're facing major climate change catastrophe - to actually have the only wind turbine factory close.
Vestas is one of the largest employers of skilled labour on the island.
The bus on route 436, operated by London Central Company, burst into flames on Park Lane on Saturday evening.
All the passengers and the driver managed to escape unharmed, but the vehicle was gutted.
Three of the double length buses have caught fire since coming into service in December.
Now special fire-suppression equipment is to be fitted to all "bendy-buses" by manufacturer Evo Bus, which is part of the Mercedes group.
And before they leave the depot all the vehicles have to be checked by staff.
Transport for London has also ruled that engineers must do an additional check.
There are about 130 "bendy buses" - officially known as Citaros - in service in London.
They were brought in to ease traffic flows before the congestion charge was introduced.
The rural affairs and environment committee has recommended the Crofting Reform Bill should now begin its passage through parliament.
Proposed new powers to tackle neglected croft land have been welcomed.
However, they have also called for action to improve rural economies in general.

Armed officers raided a house in Brixton early this morning looking for a man in connection with a robbery.
Crowds began to gather outside the district's police station when news broke the police had accidentally shot the man's mother, Cherry Groce, in her bed with apparently no warning.
Local people had already been very critical of police tactics in Brixton and a mood of tension exploded into violence as night fell.
Dozens of officers dressed in riot gear were injured as they were attacked by groups of mainly black youths with bricks and wooden stakes.
The rioters also set alight a barricade of cars across the Brixton Road with petrol bombs and some looted shops in nearby streets.
The suspected armed robber was not home when the police raided his address and Scotland Yard described the shooting of his mother as a "tragic accident".
One of Mrs Groce's daughters told the BBC everything happened very quickly.
"It was a loud noise that made me run down the stairs - by the time I got down there were three police dogs, police rushing everywhere and one of them had a gun," she said.
Mrs Groce is being treated at St Thomas' Hospital in central London and her family say the mother-of-six may never walk again.
"She is just in a state of shock - she cannot recall with any great accuracy because it all happened so fast," said her brother Tony Young.
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said it did all it could to prevent mistakes like this, but it had to recognise the increased use of firearms by criminals made errors more likely.
Mrs Groce was crippled in the incident and was in hospital for two years.
The officer who shot her, Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was cleared of all criminal charges in January 1987 and was reinstated.
But a major review of Metropolitan Police gun policy after the incident led to a ban on CID detectives carrying firearms.
The new guidelines said only centrally controlled specialist squads - like Special Branch - would be armed.
Since he overthrew his bloodthirsty uncle Macias Nguema in a military coup in 1979, President Obiang claims to have survived numerous coup attempts over the years.
Now, oil production is rising fast, but this has not, apparently, helped him preserve stability in this former Spanish colony.
He won the last two presidential elections, in 1998 and 2002, with over 98% of the vote, and if you attend his rallies, you might almost believe he is that popular.
Huge crowds in the capital Malabo wait for hours in the sun to see him, then raise their fists and cheer wildly when the great leader speaks.
But locals will tell you - quietly that it is not so much affection, as fear, that motivates these public shows of support.
Protected for years by Moroccan bodyguards, President Obiang has presided over several waves of repression.
A badly-scarred man told me how the president's soldiers cut his ears off with scissors.
Some brave local opposition officials describe killings and torture in prisons, often after alleged coup plots they say are fabricated, to justify crackdowns.
Despite his brutal reputation, President Obiang is different in person.
In interviews he prefers dark, sober suits and he is calm and measured; sometimes he speaks so quietly you have to lean forwards to hear him.
Faced with a difficult question, he will not get angry but arch his eyebrows quizzically, patiently denying abuses or blaming his enemies for planting misinformation.
What has struck me is President Obiang's apparent lack of concern about his image overseas.
Before the 2002 elections I asked him why so much public oil money had apparently disappeared.
President Obiang has put close family in the key positions of power and local politics has recently been dominated by tensions between his son Teodorin, and other close relatives with powerful positions in the security forces.
Perhaps oil has given him a new source of strength that enables him to rely less on the family than before.
This shift, some say, may have stoked anger in his clan.
The thwarting of the latest apparent coup attempt has preserved his position for now, but the family tensions still simmer.
Some customers who had got their overdraft penalty charges refunded have been told their accounts will be closed in 30 days.
In recent months, the number of people suing their current account providers regarding overdraft fees has increased.
The bank said the customers had clearly not accepted its terms and conditions.
"As it is clear that you do not accept certain aspects of the terms and conditions for the operation of your account, we regret that we are unable to continue to offer you banking facilities," the bank said in its letter to the customers.
Under the UK banking code, Alliance & Leicester has the right to close the accounts.
Consumer group Which? estimates 1 in 4 consumers face unauthorised overdraft fees at an annual cost of �3bn.
The group has encouraged consumers hit with "unfair and excessive" charges to take court actions.
A recent BBC News website investigation revealed that nearly 200 customers of UK banks and building societies have been refunded their unauthorised overdraft fees.
Recently - and unexpectedly - the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) ripped into the banking industry's charging regime.
Charges, the regulator argued, "should only reflect the administrative costs of dealing with the default," as it criticised charges for credit card late payments.
The OFT has said the same principle should apply to default charges on overdrafts.
Dr Pepper made the offer after several release dates for the rock band's long-awaited album passed.
The album, which is the band's first since 1993, is coming out in the US on 23 November and a day later in the UK.
Americans will have to visit the drinks manufacturer's website to register for a coupon to obtain their free can.
Registration will only be possible for 24 hours after the album's US release date next month, and vouchers could take up to six weeks to arrive.
Earlier this year, Dr Pepper challenged Guns N' Roses to finally bring out their CD.
The company said that in an "unprecedented show of solidarity with Axl", all Americans would receive a free can, "except estranged guitarists Slash and Buckethead".
The band's frontman, Axl Rose, said at the time that he was "surprised and very happy" to have the firm's support.
The acts on the list were chosen by 165 UK-based tastemakers, who each named their favourite three new artists, and the 15 acts with the most votes are on the longlist.
The top five and winner will be revealed at the start of January.
The tastemakers are experts in current and new music, whose tastes and decisions are regularly reflected in the media and are capable of setting the musical agenda and influencing audiences.
Most are newspaper and magazine critics and editors, radio DJs or producers, TV presenters or producers, website editors or respected bloggers.
They include DJs such as BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe and Nick Grimshaw, 1Xtra's Tim Westwood and Trevor Nelson, Radio 2's Mark Radcliffe and Dermot O'Leary, 6 Music's Marc Riley, Channel 4's Rick Edwards, Capital Radio's Rich Clarke and Kiss 100's Jez Welham.
The top five will be ranked and revealed in reverse order in the week commencing 4 January 2010, with one act named each day until the winner is unveiled on 8 January.
Each act from the top five will be featured on the BBC News website entertainment section, while BBC 6 Music will feature the top five artists with live sessions and interviews on Lauren Laverne's show and online.
Other artists in the top five in previous years include Florence and the Machine and La Roux (Sound of 2009), Duffy and the Ting Tings (Sound of 2008), Klaxons (Sound of 2007), Bloc Party and Kaiser Chiefs (Sound of 2005) and Franz Ferdinand and Razorlight (Sound of 2004).
The decision by the hardline Islamic government of Afghanistan to destroy all statues in the country has provoked indignation across the world.
Even Pakistan, the Taleban's closest ally, has called on the Taleban to show greater tolerance.
But the destruction of statues for ideological or doctrinal reasons has a long history in the world, right across Europe and Asia, and is by no means restricted to the Muslim world.
Indeed, the word iconoclasm - the breaking of images - derives from the early centuries of the Christian era.
In Tibet, where the Buddhist society placed great emphasis on holy relics, images and statues, this was particularly devastating.
Tsering Shakya, a Tibetan historian working at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said there was a feeling by Maoists that traditional symbols and religious ideology were hampering the construction of the new Tibet.
"Mao used to say if you make a mistake, there's no point in trying to correct it in piecemeal fashion, what you need to do is to wipe it out completely and create a totally new culture.
"So during the Cultural Revolution there was an attempt to literally destroy every single religious item.
"We are not just talking about the destruction of a few important statues, we are talking about the destruction of the entire presence of religious symbols in private houses, in monasteries, temples, village prayer halls.
Going back 400 years to the English reformation, there are examples of the destruction of religious images on grounds remarkably similar to those used by the Taleban - namely to discourage idolatry.
The campaign of destruction went on for a whole century, starting during the reign of Henry VIII as part of the campaign against the monasteries.
The idea behind the destruction, she said, was commandments in the Old Testament that said 'Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image or any likeness', and 'Thou shall not bow down to them'.
"The feeling was that people were attributing to the object, to the images - and this particularly applies to sculpture, which is the most realistic art form - they were attributing to the objects a power that is really only God's," said Dr Aston.
There was such a thorough campaign against religious statues in England that there are very few such works of art left.
They have applied the method to couples undergoing fertility treatment and claim they are up to 90% successful in choosing the sex of the unborn child.
The technique could be good news for couples who can only have children of one sex for medical reasons -some genetic disorders, for instance, are only passed on to children of a particular sex.
The sheep in the fields, to an outsider, look like attractive additions but to the farmers, they are the visible signs of impending ruin.
It's believed the word Skipton is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word for sheep - which gives a good idea of how important the animals have been for the town's prosperity.
They once brought wealth and prestige.
But now, most farmers find it hard to make a living from livestock.
With the restrictions imposed as a result of foot-and-mouth, they say that has now become nigh on impossible.
The outbreak could not have come at a worse time for British livestock farmers.
The next couple of weeks are traditionally some of the busiest of the year, with hill farmers making the bulk of their annual profit at the autumn sales.
They sell on "store lambs" to other buyers who will keep them - as well as breeding ewes - until they themselves sell them on in February or March.
Government vets are doing what they can to make sure that the restrictions do not destroy the very thing they are trying to save.
Britain is now divided into "risk" and "low risk" areas, in terms of foot-and-mouth, as well as a protection zone around previously-infected farms in Surrey.
The foot-and-mouth low risk area includes all of England, Scotland and Wales, apart from south-east England and the Home Counties.
Although quiet, the first day of the sales in Skipton did have a buzz about them if only because they're the first such sales in several weeks.
Farmers, their faces lined from years of hard work outdoors, leant along the rails of the livestock ring, flat caps in hand or on head, making bids in a way so imperceptible they were only obvious to the auctioneer, whose sing-song tally of the price was only understood by those who needed to know.
"Prices are depressed but not as depressed as we feared," said sheep and arable farmer Russell Toothill, the National Farmers' Union chairman for South and West Yorkshire.
For many people, it's good to get out and have a coffee and a pie in the livestock market cafe with other farmers.
The hills can be lonely places.
One farmers told me of someone who came with their animals to market three days after the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the immediate imposition of a total livestock movement ban.
The export ban has meant a glut of lamb in the UK, which has further depressed prices.
But the word on the street is that slaughterhouses say there's so much red tape involved in these new regulations, in terms of inspections and cleaning, that it's not worth their while to slaughter export animals.
"I really hope they will," Environment Secretary Hilary Benn told the BBC.
The allegation concerned an incident which was claimed to have taken place at a party in his home in 1995.
The Metropolitan Police said no further action would be taken following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.
Mr Leslie's law firm released a statement on his behalf, saying he was "delighted" at the decision.
"Yet again, after a complete and thorough investigation, it has been confirmed that there is no truth or substance to the damaging allegations that were made against our client last month.
"The law confers a blanket of anonymity on complainants but the accused enjoys no such protection.
"Instead his reputation, his character, his career and his family are regarded as fair game by the media.
The former host of ITV's This Morning was accused in 2003 of two counts of indecent assault on a 23-year-old actress, said to have taken place in May 1997, but the charges were dropped.
Mr Leslie was told he could leave the court "without a stain on his character".
He attended Teddington police station last month after the fresh allegation surfaced.
We can see that there is damage done to the side of the building, and that the top of the building is tilted, although only just.
And then the second one hits.
Thompson, who won decathlon gold at the 1980 and 1984 Games, will visit athletics clubs and universities before holding training camps in September.
Thompson believes his experience is vital to finding and nurturing the next generation of British stars, who will take centre stage at the 2012 Olympics.
A squad of 58 athletes brought back three gold medals and one bronze from the 2004 Games in Athens but more will be expected on home soil in six years time.
"Everybody realises we're struggling at the moment, and people keep talking about the 2012 Olympics, " said Thompson.
"I've spoken to some of the others (who have starred for Britain in the past) and we know the most under-utilised asset we have is our experience.
UK Athletics performance director Dave Collins has remedied that by holding talks with both Thompson and Linford Christie about coaching roles.
A mentoring scheme to develop up-and-coming athletes is in the pipeline and an official announcement will be made this season.
Fifa had ruled the club could not sign players until 2011 after inducing Gael Kakuta to break his Lens contract.
The decision means Chelsea can sign players in January, though manager Carlo Ancelotti stated he is happy with the players currently at his disposal.
"Now, thanks to this decision we have time to look for new players," said Ancelotti, who will lose Michael Essien, Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou and John Mikel Obi to the African Nations Cup in January.
"I know we will lose four in January but if we maintain the players' fitness we can do a good period also without the African players.
No date has been given for a final decision from Cas but the case is not expected to be concluded until spring of next year.
Fifa had banned the Premier League leaders in September from any activity during the next two transfer windows after they were found guilty of inducing Kakuta, now aged 18, to breach his contract with French club Lens in 2007.
Under the terms of the original Fifa punishment, French teenager Kakuta was ordered to pay compensation of 780,000 euros (£710,000), for which Chelsea were "jointly and severally liable".
Chelsea were also told to pay Lens "training compensation" of 130,000 euros (£118,000).
Scientists in Australia have discovered that the shape of male koalas' larynxes allows them to sound much bigger than they actually are, making them more attractive to females.
Dr Bill Ellis, director of the Koala Ecology Group at the University of Queensland, hails the latest development in koala studies.
Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency says the situation is critical and humanitarian assistance is needed to prevent an emergency.
Recent rebel attacks and army counter insurgency operations, combined with poor rains over the past two years, have disrupted food supplies.
In August, the UN said emergency food aid was needed for 600,000 people.
This latest report, prepared with technical assistance from the aid agency Save the Children, is the first attempt to measure the effects of the current situation on young children in the Ogaden.
It follows reports submitted to the government last month by both Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) and the UN, which also sounded the alarm.
The Ethiopian government had promised to ensure that the food and medical needs of the people in the region were met in collaboration with UN agencies and other partners.
This, the report says, indicates a critical nutritional status situation, which is something short of a humanitarian emergency but could very quickly turn into one without immediate action.
The BBC's Elizabeth Blunt in the capital, Addis Ababa, says the report scrupulously avoids allotting blame but shows how natural and man-made causes have combined to put these children in danger.
The area of Fiq where the assessment teams carried out their work was already impoverished and short of food even before the upsurge in rebel attacks this year and the army operation which followed.
The Ethiopian army has been accused by Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) separatists of operating a food blockade and causing a man-made famine.
The rains in Fiq have been poor for the past two years and there is little pasture for the animals.
Now security operations have disrupted normal commercial food supplies and made men in particular afraid to travel to places where they might be able to buy.
Prices of grain have doubled, while the price of livestock - people's main source of income - has halved.
Even those with money, the report says, have no easy access to food and an urgent response is needed to ensure that the children in these areas survive.
In early September MSF warned that a disaster was looming in the region and complained it had been denied access by the government in Addis Ababa.
Later the same month a UN fact-finding mission found a "pervasive climate of fear" in Ogaden and called for an independent investigation into abuses of civilians.
The ONLF was founded in 1984 and is fighting for independence from Ethiopia, complaining of discrimination by the central government against the region's Somali-speaking nomads.
There was the Mark Foley "October surprise" over his inappropriate e-mails to teenage pages, and the "one week to go" surprise of John Kerry's botched joke about grunts in Iraq.
There was the "eve of election day surprise" of 2004 when, who should pop up on the airwaves but Osama Bin Laden, punctiliously even handed, endorsing neither candidate, calling them both equally evil.
It may have tipped the marginal voters of Ohio into George Bush's camp.
Will Sunday's "pre-election surprise" do the same? I doubt it.
First of all, the death sentence against Saddam Hussein was hardly a surprise, since it became a virtual inevitability once the barricades went up in Baghdad, anticipating a flare-up of already well-flared violence.
Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, curled his lip in Crawford, Texas and called the suggestion absurd.
And every time the violence got worse, the landscape bloodier, the prospects of victory dimmer.
After three-and-a-half years of euphoria degenerating into agony, the vast majority of Americans have made up their minds on Iraq and Sunday's verdict will not change it before Tuesday.
The news may persuade a few leaden-footed Republicans - crying into their beers over budget deficits, sex scandals and a mismanaged war - to shuffle to the polls.
It could even make the difference in marginal Senate seats like Missouri, Virginia or Montana, which are too close to call and could tip either way.
But the verdict also puts Iraq, warts and all, back on the front pages.
It invites uncomfortable comparisons between the rule of law in court and the lawlessness of death squads roaming the streets of Baghdad.
So, even by the administration's own reckoning, it would take a miracle to save the House of Representatives from the earthquake of a Democratic takeover.
That alone would be enough to shift the tectonic plates of American politics.
When the Democrats control House committees, they are sure to summon a raft of investigations into the war, how it was justified, how it was managed and how it was financed.
Don't underestimate the thirst for revenge on Capitol Hill.
Furthermore, Sunday's verdict from Iraq will be followed on Monday by another verdict in the form of a biting editorial in four military publications - The Army Times, The Marines Times, the Navy Times and the Air Force Times - in which they will all call on Donald Rumsfeld to step down on grounds of incompetence.
When military "in-house" magazines, more comfortable with cheerleading, call for the scalps of their bosses in the middle of an unpopular war, you know you have a problem.
Welcome to the season of bitter verdicts!
Starting in Azerbaijan, the 1,600km (1,000 mile) pipeline will pass through Georgia to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
The project has taken more than 10 years to finish and will unlock one of the world's biggest energy reserves.
It has not been without controversy, however, and there have been protests about the impact on the environment.
Some demonstrators were beaten and arrested last Saturday, with Azeri authorities saying that they acted because the protest was too close to the pipeline.
Wednesday's inauguration at the Sangachal oil terminal near Baku was attended by presidents from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Turkey.
US Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman also was present at a ceremony where the taps were turned on.
The pipeline has been an international effort and was built by a consortium led by UK oil giant BP, which has a 30% stake.
Other consortium members include Azerbaijan's state oil company Socar, Amerada Hess, ConocoPhillips, Eni, Inpex, Itochu, Statoil, Total, TPAO and Unocal.
David Woodward, the head of BP's operations in Azerbaijan, said that the opening marked the former Soviet state's "rebirth as an important country for the oil industry, just as it was more than a century ago".
Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliev said that "this pipeline first of all will help solve economic and social problems" but also will play a role in "strengthening peace and security in the region".
The BBC's Emma Simpson said from Baku that for energy-hungry countries such as the US the pipeline was a strategically important non-Russian, non-Middle Eastern source of oil.
The Caspian area produces a high-quality light crude, but has suffered in the past because of the difficulty of getting its oil to consumers in Europe, the US, China and Japan.
Until now, states in the region sent almost all of their oil via Russian pipelines.
The Caspian project is not without risk, however, as the pipeline runs through the volatile Caucasus and will require constant surveillance to prevent it from attack, our correspondent said.
Work on the pipeline was given fresh impetus in the late 1990s after BP made new oil discoveries in Azerbaijan and crude prices began to recover from historic lows.
Up to a million barrels a day will eventually be heading directly west, gushing underneath miles of rugged terrain.
However, it will take several months merely to fill the pipeline, which has a capacity of 10 million barrels.
The oil in the pipeline will initially come entirely from Azerbaijani fields, but Kazakhstan is expected to participate in the project before the end of the decade.
Lord Fowler, chairman of the BBC Charter Review Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was currently a "democratic deficit".
He added there should be more scrutiny of the �3bn of public money was given to the corporation annually.
He said assessment of the BBC's Charter Renewal bid was "totally inadequate".
"It means there's no debate on a whole range of issues and we are talking about �3bn of public money, going up to �4bn, each year.
When the government's charter renewal white paper was published in March, the licence fee was described as the "least worst" way to fund the corporation.
The document also made entertainment a top priority for the BBC without chasing ratings or cloning successful shows on rival channels.
The letter tells Ms Jowell that "the government has too much unchecked power" and demands that "parliament must be given a greater role".
The current arrangements, in which parliament can accept or reject but not amend the licence fee, was "wrong", it claims.
"Parliament should have the opportunity to scrutinise properly and to amend the formula that will dictate how much every household will pay.
The BBC's media correspondent, Torin Douglas, said the committee thought the BBC's current bid for a licence fee increase was excessive and should be scrutinised by the National Audit Office, he added.
A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport defended the current method of scrutiny.
He said this had been "the most open charter review process ever", with "both industry and the public being asked for their views".
In addition, since charter review began, there had been four select committee reports and a number of parliamentary debates, he said.
"Our research and consultation, which we have published, shows the public do not want parliament or government to have any more control over the BBC than they currently do.
"However, the public do want a more accountable BBC and we will deliver that through the new Trust - a body that will act in the interests of the licence fee payer, clearly separated from the management," he added.
The Paris court also gave Pierre Pinoncelli, 77, a three-month suspended sentence for the attack last month which left the urinal slightly cracked.
The attack happened at the Pompidou Centre in Paris.
In a December 2004 poll of art experts, the urinal was named the most influential modern art work of all time.
The Paris court on Tuesday told Mr Pinoncelli to pay an additional 14,352 euros (�9,867) to repair the exhibit.
Mr Pinoncelli, a former salesman, had argued that the attack was a work of performance art and he had made Fountain, one of eight versions of the piece, an original.
The judge disagreed and told him to respect other people's property.
They have discovered that compounds found in black tea may attack harmful bacteria in the mouth that cause gum disease and cavities.
Researchers have previously focused on the possible health benefits of green teas.
They found that compounds in black tea were capable of killing or suppressing growth and acid production of cavity-causing bacteria in dental plaque.
Black tea also affects the bacterial enzyme glucosyltranferase which is responsible for converting sugars into the sticky matrix material that plaque uses to adhere to teeth.
In addition, certain plaque bacteria, upon exposure to black tea, lost their ability to form the clumpy aggregates with other bacteria in plaque, thereby reducing the total mass of the dental plaque.
One experiment showed that when volunteers rinsed with black tea for 30 seconds five times at three-minute intervals, plaque bacteria stopped growing and producing acid, which breaks down the teeth and causes cavities.
Lead researcher Dr Christina Wu said the research indicated that black tea could have a "significant" impact on dental health.
However, she warned that the beneficial effect was dependent on people taking good care of their teeth in other ways.
The British Dental Association said both black and green tea could help to combat the build-up of plaque.
Dental erosion involves demineralisation where teeth are attacked by acids and tooth enamel is consequently worn away.
It can be extremely painful, especially if it is extensive enough to wear through the enamel and expose the dentine and tooth pulp underneath.
The BDA spokesperson said that tea was also a good source of fluoride which can help to protect the teeth.
A spokesperson for the British Dental Health Foundation agreed, but pointed out that only 10-11% of the UK's tap water is currently fluoridated.
He said that as 98% of people take their tea with milk, it also provided a good source of calcium.
"However, it still remains to be demonstrated whether the benefits observed in the research are replicated during normal tea drinking," he added.
The research was presented at the American Society for Microbiology in Orlando, Florida.
Here four of the panel give their reaction to the resignation of David Blunkett as Work and Pensions Secretary.

The university said the cuts were as a result of cost-cutting, or external funding coming to an end.
The University and College Union (UCU)has opposed the measure and said it feared there were plans for further compulsory redundancies.
"It will also continue to create new posts or fill vacant ones where appropriate.
The Tories would recruit 40,000 extra officers, back zero tolerance policing, build more prisons and "stand up for the silent, law-abiding majority".
Officers would not be asked to spend time issuing receipts to every person stopped, as currently planned, he said.
The Tory leader blamed "sociological mumbo-jumbo" for blurring the distinction between right and wrong.
He pledged to scrap the electronic tagging system which has seen 68,000 prisoners released early since 1999 - with Mr Howard saying that 3,500 offences had been committed by tagged offenders.
The recording of ethnic group, name and address of all those stopped by the police was one of the recommendations of the Macpherson Report into Stephen Lawrence's death.
At the moment records are only kept of those who are searched after being stopped.
He also called for more respect to be shown by people in general, urging stronger discipline and respect in schools and at home.
He stressed the need for fathers to play a key role in children's lives, particularly for boys - saying the Tories would bring in a presumption for equal parenting rights.
Mr Howard pledged to return to schools the power to deal with violent and unruly pupils.
"Disruptive pupils do not just ruin their own education; they ruin that of every other child in the class," he said.
Mr Howard attacked the tendency in wider society for rights to outweigh citizens' sense of responsibility.
There was an "ethical quagmire" where "the clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo-jumbo and politically correct nonsense", he added.
Referring to Tony Blair's speech last month calling for an end to the 1960s liberal consensus on law and order, he said he had ended that when he became home secretary in the early 1990s.
Mr Howard made the speech after meeting the town's independent mayor, Ray Mallon.
Mr Mallon earned the nick-name "Robocop" during his police career because of his zero-tolerance approach to crime and unruly behaviour.
Mr Howard took the opportunity to outline what he said were the successes of zero tolerance policing in Middlesbrough and New York.
He said the Conservatives would support the police on stop and search.
A Conservative government would increase prison space, and also increase from 2,000 to 20,000 the number of drug rehabilitation spaces in the UK.
"Addicts will then face a choice - rehab or prison, and if you drop out of rehab you go straight to prison, there will be no second chances," he will say.
The element of the speech which received most comment beforehand was the announcement that the Conservatives would not implement the Macpherson recommendation on issuing receipts to those stopped.
That decision was described as "deeply disappointing" by Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, which encourages ethnic minorities to participate in the democratic process.
He said it was "sanctioning the demonisation of black and Asian youth".
"Over the last 12 months the Conservatives have come a long way to positively engage with Britain's black communities," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
But the system of stop and search was a "draconian, humiliating, sledgehammer to crack a nut approach to crime".
According to one minister, police said they wanted "to learn about the way the honours system normally works".
The probe began after it was revealed all three main parties were given secret loans ahead of the last election.
It now appears many, if not all, of the members of the Cabinet at around the time of the 2005 general election, apart from Tony Blair, have received letters from or been contacted in some other way by detectives.
Chancellor Gordon Brown and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott are among those to have been contacted about the loans, worth �14m, made before the 2005 election, it emerged earlier.
Others known to have been contacted include Jack Straw, John Reid, David Miliband, Alan Johnson, Peter Hain and Ruth Kelly.
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said it appeared that not all ministers had received the same letter.
One Cabinet source said they were simply asked if they were involved in any way in certain peerage nominations.
But another said they were also asked about their knowledge of any loans secured by Labour before the election.
The Scotland Yard officer in charge of the investigation, John Yates, has previously told MPs "you go where the evidence takes you".
Our correspondent said it was for this reason that friends of Mr Blair expect him to be interviewed - possibly under caution - in the weeks to come.
But they insist the prime minister has had no contact with the police as yet.
Police are thought to have spoken to, or contacted, more than 50 people, including some of Mr Blair's closest advisers, and, from the Conservative side, former leader Michael Howard.
A Conservative spokesman said on Wednesday no other shadow ministers had been contacted by police.
Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald - a former colleague of Cherie Blair - and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair, have decided to stand aside from decisions related to the investigation.
Attorney General Lord Goldsmith - who attends Cabinet and who is close to Mr Blair - on Tuesday said he would not stand aside from the process but promised to act "in the interests of justice".

South Korea has been leading protests against the books, which Japan's neighbours say gloss over wartime atrocities.
Japan's ambassador had earlier been summoned to the South Korean foreign ministry, where he was presented with proposed changes to 35 passages in eight of the newly-approved books.
Emotions are running high in South Korea over the issue, where there are still bitter memories of Japan's 35-year occupation.
He said on Tuesday they been approved by the education ministry with modifications.
His senior officials have been stressing that revision would only be possible were there "clear mistakes" in the texts.
"But we need to take sincerely what the Republic of Korea says and study what steps we can take in the future, as there are differences in the perceptions of historians on both sides," Mr Koizumi said.
Tokyo argues that the history textbooks, approved by an independenteducation commission, do not represent its official views.
Most of the disputed passages are contained in one history book written by a group of Japanese nationalist historians.
The book, like several others, omits any reference to the tens of thousands of women - most of them Korean - forced to serve as sex slaves for Japan's military.
Koreans were also barred from speaking theirlanguage and required to adopt Japanese names.
China and other Asian nations occupied by Japan in the first half of the 20th century have also condemned the books.
"Showing no respect for the truth, Japanese right-wingrevisionists are consciously pushing Japan's younggeneration toward a kind of historical amnesia," said aneditorial in Tuesday's state-run China Daily.
The speech is being seen as an attempt to persuade Japanese companies that they should keep investing in the UK.
Mr Cook's speech is one of the strongest pro-euro statements by a government minister yet, and stands in stark contrast to the Labour Party's recent cautious statements over the single currency.
The government suffered a surprise defeat in the European elections in June, during which the Conservative Party had made much of its opposition to Britain abandoning sterling.
In the speech, Mr Cook said that, on present trends, all countries in the euro will enjoy "significant benefits" from monetary union, and international investors had already shown their confidence in the single currency.
"I assure you that if the euro proves a stable, successful currency, (Prime Minister) Tony Blair's government will make sure that Britain is ready to take part subject to the support of the British people in a referendum," he said.
Mr Cook stressed that "If the euro brings benefits to its members, we will not let Britain lose out by staying out".
He suggested that there was evidence that the birth of the euro had provided a "major stimulus to economic restructuring within the euro-zone".
The Shadow Chancellor, Francis Maude, said Mr Cook's remarks would make it clear that Labour had "privately made up their minds to scrap the pound and join the single currency at the earliest opportunity".
The UK government has promised to hold a referendum and let voters decide whether to replace the pound with the euro.
During his three-day visit, Mr Cook is to meet Japan's Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, as well as Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura.
The obvious solution is to structure the funding or ownership with another party in order to make that first home affordable.
The main purpose of the New Build HomeBuy scheme is to make home ownership affordable for key workers and those considered to be in housing need.
It is important that the whole country has a good spread of key workers to service every community.
In any particular region of the country, the Regional Housing Board in conjunction with local organisations decides the eligibility of those applying for shared ownership.
The way shared ownership works is that the home purchaser raises several thousands of pounds to pay for house-buying costs and secures a mortgage for their share of the property.
The purchaser also pays a low rent on the remainder of the property which is owned by the RSL/Housing Association.
For example, the homebuyer raises the cash to buy 50% of the property and then pays rent on the remaining 50%.
New Build HomeBuy has been created for a specific housing purpose and so eligibility is an important factor.
The scheme is primarily intended for key workers such as nurses, teachers, firemen, speech and occupational therapists, armed forces personnel in the south east, and nursery nurses.
The list of key workers evolves with time and it is always worth checking the latest list.
As well as key workers, the scheme is meant to help others in housing need.
When considering shared ownership it's important that you ask all the right questions so you can establish what your rights, responsibilities and any costs might be.
To find out if you qualify for shared ownership in your area, you need to contact your local HomeBuy agent.
They will take your application and review it.
Hopefully you will find you are can be considered.
Some new housebuilders and the government through its (key worker targeted) Open Market HomeBuy scheme offer shared equity.
With shared equity you take out a large mortgage for most of the property value (75% in the case of the Open Market HomeBuy scheme) and a low cost equity loan for the balance.
Shared equity is different from shared ownership in that the homebuyer is not renting a percentage of the property but has taken out a low-cost loan to purchase it.
This means you're basically paying for the property in portions - you will have to repay all the loans when you sell up - which may work out quite expensive in the long run.
This means buying a property with friends or family.
This is becoming a popular way to buy property.
There are even specialised websites that introduce strangers to each other with the aim of buying property jointly.
This can be a good way of expanding buying power and buying a bigger property.
Before making such a leap be 100% sure that you can live with the person you are buying with.
The best arrangement may be to buy with someone who has no intention of sharing the property with you, for example a parent.
In addition, make sure you see a solicitor who can draw up a will so that you can establish what happens to the property if one of the owners dies.
Your parents might indeed be willing and able to help financially - they might review their finances and make a gift to you of a deposit to help you out.
In addition, they may even help you out by acting as a guarantor for your mortgage or even taking out a joint mortgage with you - they need not necessarily be on the deeds to the property, they can just help you pay for it.
Mortgage lenders have risen to the challenge and are now offering some very innovative ways of lending - they essentially come down to lending more or extending the pay-back period.
This need not necessarily be a bad thing - it's not unusual to be paying a mortgage for well over 25 years - and if things change you can always reduce the term.
Pressplay is backed by Sony and Universal and is set to launch its service to subscribers this autumn.
He added that Pressplay aims to continue to sign a wide variety of labels.
Online swapping services like Pressplay are the music industry's attempt to attract people away from the unofficial music download services that have sprung up since Napster's decision to develop a paid-for service.
Napster has also promised its users it will be up and running with a subscription-based website by the new year.
Noel Mamere, mayor of the Bordeaux town of Begles and a leading member of parliament for the Green Party, had said he would conduct the marriage.
But the public prosecutor of Bordeaux has declared his opposition and ordered Mr Mamere to abandon his plans.
The wedding plans have sparked public debate, drawing condemnation from the government and church leaders.
The mayor had said he would perform the marriage of Bertrand Charpentier and Stephane Chapin on 5 June.
Civil unions between same-sex partners have been legal in France since 2000.
However, gay lobby groups say these fall short of legal marriages as they do not come with benefits such as adoption rights or the same fiscal advantages.
French Justice Minister Dominique Perben has expressed his opposition to the marriage and told parliament last month that he intended to ask the Bordeaux prosecutor to block the marriage.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bordeaux, Jean-Pierre Ricard, has condemned the plans not only on religious grounds but also as a means "to support the founding principles of social life itself".
The new Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has said he is in favour of allowing same-sex marriages.
They were among four people seriously wounded when United Nations and local police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse some 3,000 protesters.
The crowd in Pristina was protesting against a UN plan on the future status of Serbia's province.
Many ethnic Albanians are unhappy that the plan falls short of granting full independence for Kosovo.
The proposals, unveiled on 2 February by chief UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari instead recommends a form of self-rule - which is itself strongly opposed by Serbia.
The UN has agreed to delay talks on its proposals until 21 February, at the request of Serbian President Boris Tadic.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday again warned that Moscow would not back any solution for Kosovo that was not also acceptable to Belgrade.
The ethnic Albanian demonstrators gathered near the provincial government building in Pristina.
The UN police fired tear gas after the protesters tried to approach the government building.
About 80 people were injured and more than a dozen demonstrators were arrested.
The protest was organised by the Kosovo Albanian group Self Determination, which advocates immediate independence for the province and the withdrawal of the international community.
Mr Ahtisaari has proposed allowing Kosovo to adopt a constitution, a flag, a national anthem and apply for membership of international organisations.
But many ethnic Albanians - who comprise some 90% of Kosovo's two million people - want an outright independence.
Mr Ahtisaari's plan also envisages that Kosovo's Serb minority would have a high degree of control over its own affairs.
Kosovo has been administered by the UN since 1999, after a Nato bombing campaign drove Serbian troops from the province.
Greece's 15 partners in the eurozone will lend it 80bn euros spread over three years - the IMF 30bn euros.
Later on Friday, Chancellor Merkel will join other eurozone heads of state for an emergency summit in Brussels.
They aim to finalise details of the loan package to Greece, while the G7 finance ministers are also due to discuss the Greek debt crisis and its implications for the global economy.
Concerns about Greece's economic crisis have spread fear of contagion in global markets.
France's Cac 40 index fell by almost 2% and Germany's Dax index down 1%.
The bill was passed by 390 votes to 72, with 139 abstentions in the German lower house, the Bundestag.
Mrs Merkel's critics used the emotional Bundestag debate to criticise her handling of the crisis, saying she had been slow to act, says the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Berlin.
The opposition Social Democrats abstained, saying the burden of the country's contribution fell too heavily on ordinary tax payers rather than on the financial markets.
But the bill was passed as Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, have a comfortable majority in parliament.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had asked the opposition to support the legislation, saying markets would "pay attention to how the help is being backed on a national level".
The German press has labelled the country's contribution as "the fattest cheque in history".
Even if the legislation is approved, one group of Eurosceptic academics will challenge the decision in Germany's highest court, our correspondent says.
On Thursday, Greek MPs approved drastic spending cuts in exchange for an international rescue plan, amid violent protests in Athens.
The austerity measures include pay and pension cuts for public sector workers, and tax rises.
But there is deep anger at the programme in Greece, which has seen days of occasionally violent protests outside parliament.
Germany and France have already called for the single currency's rulebook to be rewritten - with tougher sanctions for those countries that run up big budget deficits, our correspondent adds.
Fears of contagion from Greece's debt crisis have rocked global stock markets, with Europe's benchmark indexes opening sharply lower on Friday after US and Asian stocks incurred major losses.

Engineers worked for 48 hours to clear the road
Transport Scotland said the route would open at 1500 BST after efforts to clear debris and repair the lower embankment.
It said "thorough safety checks" had been concluded and traffic management systems were now in place.
The road was closed on Tuesday after a section of the hillside came away following sustained heavy rain.
Transport Scotland said that 1,070 tonnes of debris had been removed from the A83.
The lower embankment has been repaired with 250 tonnes of rockfill and blocked culverts and ditches have been cleared and are now "running free".
Traffic management systems will remain on the road until more permanent measures are implemented next year.
Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson said the quick response to the landslip had "minimised inconvenience and disruption to the local community".
"The response has been swift and we appreciate the patience shown by the general public while the road was made safe and brought back to normal operations," he said.
Domestic violence goes on in every type of street, in any kind of house and in all sorts of families.
It's often kept secret because people are too frightened or embarrassed to tell anyone else.
In most cases, domestic violence is a carried out by a man against a woman, but it can happen to men too.
Hundreds of thousands of children in the UK hear or see one of their parents beat or threaten the other.
It can be a really frightening experience.
The teenage southpaw boxed his way to the bantamweight title after out-pointing hot favourite Martin Lindsay.
Lindsay, the only Northern Ireland boxer to win a bout at the Commonweath Games, was going for his third title in succession.
But once the Holy Trinity boxer caught the champion with a left hook at the end of the first round, the writing was on the wall.
Lindsay had problem keeping up with the fleeted Gillen, an appretice joiner from Antrim.
Lindsay attempted to land the big hits, but continually walked into crisp shots to head and body.
Gillen grew in stature at the fight went on and his footwork often left Lindsay frustrated.
In the end, Gillen outscored his more experienced opponent 21-11, and was also awarded the Best Boxer award on the evening.
Meanwhile, Shaun McKim destroyed Holy Trinity's Barry Reilly to take the flyweight title.
McKim took control right from the first bell and danced his way to a comfortable 23-9 success to give his Abbey Club a rare success at the Championships.
McKim also walked off with the Most Improved Young Boxer award.
In the super heavyweight category, Immaculata's Martin Rogan, the Irish intermediate champion, banged his way to victory over Tyrone rival Trevor Black.
The heavyweight decider was not as explosive as expected as defending champion Shane Curran from Enniskillen thumped Holy Trinity's Conall Carmichael 22-7.
The new featherweight champion is Raymond Kane who defeated Willie Mitchell 22-12.
Irish national champion Paul McCloskey from Dungirvan had the better of Ballymena's Dermot Hamill in the light welterweight final with a 16-4 victory.
Light flyweight Paul Baker and lightweight Andrew Murray had no sweat in collecting titles after walkovers.
The verdicts in the Lockerbie bomb trial mark the culmination of a long and tortuous story stretching back more than 12 years.
Behind the trial lies decades of hostility between the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the United States.
In April 1986, a bomb exploded in a Berlin nightclub, killing two American soldiers.
According to Washington's theory, the attack that brought down a Pan-American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988 was Libya's revenge.
The bombing claimed the lives of all 259 on board and 11 on the ground.
At first the police investigation focused on the activities of a Syrian-backed extremist Palestinian group - the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command - especially on a cell uncovered in Germany.
Stories have surfaced over the years suggesting that the Islamic Iranian Government was responsible - acting to avenge the loss of one of its airliners which was shot down by the US over the Gulf a few months before Lockerbie.
Backed up by France, which held Libya to blame for a separate bomb attack on a French airliner over the Sahara, the United States and Britain pushed a resolution through the security council calling on Libya to co-operate with Western judicial authorities.
Several years of stalemate followed, while the families of the American and British victims of the Lockerbie attack wondered if they would ever discover the truth or see anyone brought to trial.
In April, the Libyans told representatives of the families that they would hand over the two men for trial in a third country under Scottish law.
In July the British and American governments said they were exploring a similar idea, reversing their position that a trial could take place only in Scotland or the United States.
At last, Libya agreed that if convicted the two accused would serve their life sentences in Scotland, although the trial would be held in the Netherlands.
And it accepted assurances that they would not be interrogated by Western intelligence or spirited away to Washington.
The trial finally got under way at Camp Zeist, in a specially built, ultra-modern court, in May last year.
It has been a unique event - the product of an elaborate compromise reflecting the fact that there is at present no permanent international criminal court to try cases of this kind.
It has been an extremely complex case with a lot at stake.
Despite the verdicts, future relations between Libya and the West, and the peace of mind of the victims' families, are still unresolved.
Photographer Jeff Widener describes how he captured the iconic 'tank man' image
The picture of "tank man" has become the enduring image of the Tiananmen massacre, and one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th Century.
Jeff Widener was one of four photographers who captured the moment as he covered the protests for the US newswire the Associated Press.
"When I look at this picture I think of how close I came to not getting it," said Mr Widener.
Despite suffering from concussion, Mr Widener managed to sneak into the Beijing Hotel, where he had a good view of Tiananmen Square.
He took three shots before realising that his camera was on the wrong shutter speed.
But by the time he solved the problem, the protester had already been dragged off the street.
"I thought I'd lost the picture," said Mr Widener.
He said an American student at the time was instrumental in helping him smuggle the undeveloped roll of film past the huge security presence in the hotel lobby, and back to the Associated Press office to be sent around the world.
Mr Widener believes the American student's name is either Kirk or Kurt - but he does not know for sure.
Mr Widener's photograph got him nominated as a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 1990.
Since then he has covered major stories in more than 100 countries and currently works as a photographer in Honolulu, Hawaii.
No-one knows for sure what happened to "tank man".
Eminent director Peter Brook has returned to the UK for his new play, Eleven and Twelve.
The play, which is set in Africa, has taken several years to create.
Balancing it on the lap increases the temperature of the scrotum which is known to have a negative effect on sperm production, researchers found.
Coupled with the rising popularity of these computers - about 150m people use them worldwide - much more research is needed say the US authors.
The State University of New York findings appear in Human Reproduction.
The researchers asked 29 healthy male volunteers aged between 21 and 35 to take part in an experiment.
They then recorded the temperature changes to the scrotum caused by laptop use and different seating positions over one hour time periods.
"We don't know the exact frequency and time of heat exposure capable of producing reversible or irreversible changes in spermatogenesis.
He said any changes might be reversible, but that repetitive use of a laptop in this way might cause permanent damage.
"Until further studies provide more information on this type of thermal exposure, teenage boys and young men may consider limiting their use of laptop computers on their laps," he said.
"It is worrying that having a laptop on your knees for only an hour can increase the temperature of the scrotum so significantly.
"Men who use laptops regularly should be very careful.
Two broadband virtual-learning packages have been designed by Medcom to help newly-qualified doctors learn basic skills and surgical procedures.
Doctors can watch the procedures in 3D and look up notes to help them prepare for exams or for a real-life operation.
The Royal College of Surgeons, England, said it hoped the programme would be a "useful adjunct" to training.
Changes to the hours trainee doctors are allowed to work mean there can be less time to practice techniques so hospitals and tutors are looking at supplementary ways of passing on information.
The package outlining foundation skills, which is being recommended by the RCS, demonstrates procedures such as lumbar punctures.
The RCS has approved it as part of the foundation training programme undertaken by trainee doctors in the first two years following medical school.
NHS trusts, including Southampton University Hospitals, have already adopted the package as part of their training programme.
A second package showing surgical skills demonstrates techniques ranging from removing a toenail to drilling into a skull.
A trial of the package by Medcom with surgical trainees in Liverpool found knowledge amongst trainee surgeons increased by over 50% after using the package.
"Changes in patterns of disease and work practices have resulted in a significant reduction in the practical surgical exposure for trainee surgeons.
It hopes its work will help to improve the level of soil nutrients and increase farmers' harvests.
The team's work is possible only because of the development of new technology.
It is being funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) and the Global Environment Facility (Gef).
The scientists will work in India, Indonesia, Kenya, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Mexico and Brazil.
Unep says the key to the scheme, the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Below-ground Biodiversity project, is the role of soil organisms as suppliers of nutrients.
In tea plantations in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu the reintroduction of earthworms has boosted harvests by almost 300%, while in Brazil it is bacteria that have achieved a turn-round.
Besides termites, worms and bacteria, the scientists will be examining the role of fungi, protozoa, nematodes, mites and ants.
The project is being coordinated by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.
Professor Swift said there was evidence that the planting of single crops led to a sharp decline in the level of sub-surface species, adversely affecting yields, moisture content, pest control and fertility.
And there are hopes of finding new species which could be a potent genetic resource, the raw material of industrial products and drugs, including antibiotics.
"But why can't we have some more funding for soil biology in temperate soils, especially in Europe and the UK?
The delay will give engineers an opportunity to investigate the incident - and time for poor weather at the Florida landing strip to pass.
"The mission management team has decided to keep Atlantis 24 more hours in orbit," a Nasa spokesman said.
Atlantis is returning from the space station where it attached solar wings.
The first opportunity for a touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center is now 0615 EDT (1015 GMT) on Thursday.
It was noticed as astronauts were testing the vehicle's jets in preparation for the return to Earth.
Mission Control has told the astronauts on Atlantis to hold off packing away the shuttle's robot arm and television antenna in case further inspections are required.
Even before the unexplained object came to the attention of engineers, Nasa was considering a change to the scheduled landing time because of unfavourable weather forecasts at Kennedy.
The US businesswoman is expected at the station with the new commander Michael Lopez-Alegria and flight engineer Mikhail Tyurinat at 0524 GMT on Wednesday.
They said to forget the needs of the poor would be to "compound regrettable past failures with needless future injustices".
The religious figures published their joint statement in advance of this Thursday's G20 meeting in London.
The 32 signatories include Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, and Muslim leader Dr Mohammed Abdul Bari.
While acknowledging the "sheer complexity" of the challenge facing politicians, the statement called on them to restore "that lost sense of balance between the requirements of market mechanisms that help deliver increased prosperity, and the moral requirement to safeguard human dignity, regardless of economic or social category".
Dr Williams said people had high expectations of the meeting.
The UK government, which is hosting the G20 meeting, wants world leaders to focus on "co-ordinated macro-economic actions to revive the global economy, stimulate growth and employment".
It also says the international community needs to act to "support vulnerable emerging and developing markets".
Other religious leaders who have signed the appeal include Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks and the the chairman of the Christian-Muslim Forum, Dr Musharraf Hussain Azhari.
The General Secretary of the Hindu Council UK, Anil Bhanot, and the Primate of the Armenian Orthodox Church of Great Britain, Bishop Nathan Hovhannisian, are also signatories.
Cherie Blair is seen as the archetypal modern mother - juggling the demands of four children, a top flight career as barrister and life alongside a globe-trotting prime minister.
Betsy, 42-years-old and a distant cousin of Diana, Princess ofWales, takes on her unofficial 'shadow' role with even less public recognition than her husband Iain.
Mr Duncan Smith apparently uses her as a sounding board, insisting she would have had the last word as he mulled over launching a leadership bid.
"If she had said 'No', it wouldn't happen," he said.
Yet her mother, Lady Cottesloe, says she is "certainly not political".
Betsy puts housework at their Fulham home and caring for the children - Edward, 14, Alicia, 12, Harry, 11, and Rosanna, 8 - top of the list of priorities.
"She's totally absorbed in her husband and the family," Lady Cottesloe says.
But according to family, friends and her husband she is no mute and passive politician's wife
"She makes sure he always has a home to come back to that's warm and welcoming, but she also takes him down a peg or two," said one friend earlier in the leadership campaign.
And Betsy has even made sure taking his turn on the school run has not been above Mr Duncan Smith when he was shadow defence secretary.
She is the daughter of life peer Lord Cottesloe, a former commander in the Royal Navy and ex-Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire.
Schooled at St Mary's, Wantage, she moved on to Stowe school for her A-levels but left at 17 to work in Harrods and then as a secretary.
Through life in the same military circles, she met her husband at a London party and in 1982 they married, when she was 23, and their first child was born five years later.
That background stands in contrast the prime minister's wife who, born in 1954, was brought up in a working class, Roman Catholic family in the north west of England.
Cherie earned a first in her law degree at the London School of Economics and came top of her year in the bar exams.
She met Tony while they were both training to be barristers.
An active supporter of the Labour Party, it has been said Tony stepped up his involvement with the party to impress her.
Mrs Blair fought and lost the no-hope seat of Thanet North in Kent at the 1983 general election.
And now in her job as a barrister specialising in employment law, she works under her maiden name, Cherie Booth.
Commission chief executive Peter Wardle said he was "disappointed" 37 parties had reported a donation late.
The Lib Dems declared �112,000 late, the Conservatives reported �74,000 late and Labour �52,000 late.
"We have already written to the parties and they've given us assurances that they are taking steps to ensure more timely reporting in line with the requirements of the legislation.
"We continue to monitor the parties closely and expect to see significant improvements in future reporting.
"We have repeatedly made clear the need for the commission to have a more flexible and proportionate range of penalties which would help us to deal with this issue.
HLC previously wanted to build a waste recovery centre which would house an incinerator on the town's industrial estate.
It shelved the proposal last year amid local health concerns.
The company said that its new proposal for a recycling centre will no longer include an incinerator.
The new scheme is for a heat treatment process for waste using pyrolysis and gasification.
HLC chairman Horacio Luis Carvalho has previously said the new plans would reduce harmful emissions.
Under the scheme the new centre will be able to handle 160,000 tonnes of waste annually, including all Wrexham's rubbish and its annual growth of three per cent for the next 25 years.
However, local campaign group TCC has said it still has concerns.
"It's a different from of combustion and we need to see," said TCC spokeswoman Chris Pilsbury.
Currently, 88% of the county's waste goes to landfill and the Welsh assembly has set tough new measures to reduce this figure.
The new centre would aim to recycle waste and what it could not recycle would be put through a heat treatment process.
HLC is keen to stress that this system is not the same as incineration.
Last November Wrexham councillors voted against the original planning application.
In May a public inquiry into the waste incinerator was cancelled.
The assembly made the decision after HLC changed its application.
A spokesman for the company said Tuesday's briefing is the beginning of a major public consultation on their plans.
The new recycling centre would have been built on the former BICC site on the town's industrial estate however the land has now been sold.
HLC now plan to build the plant on the former site of Owens Corning, a fibre glass factory which announced its closure in December 2002.
If the plans get the go-ahead, construction work would begin next year and the site could be fully operational by 2007.

The US is responsible for nearly a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, but President Bush refuses to budge on his opposition to mandatory restrictions.
However, this is not the end of the story.
In Congress, Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman are about to reintroduce their Climate Stewardship Bill which narrowly failed to pass in the Senate two years ago.
Senator McCain expects to fail again this time round, but is optimistic of succeeding before long.
At a news conference last week he and Senator Lieberman shared the podium with a bipartisan group from both houses, and stressed that concern over global warming was growing and that it crossed party lines and geographic regions.
One convert is a senior Republican senator from Nebraska, Chuck Hagel, who fought to keep the US from joining the Kyoto protocol but is now planning to introduce himself what he describes as "comprehensive climate change legislation".
Nigel Purvis, an environment scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that on the issue of climate change, "the heart of the Republican party is moving".
On the other side, are some of the party's most popular figures, such as Senator McCain and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, stars of the Republican convention in 2004.
In California, Mr Schwarzenegger has promised to defend legislation signed by his Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis, that would require carmakers to cut harmful emissions from cars and trucks sold in the state by about 30%, from 2016.
A number of states are already involved in regional initiatives on climate change.
Mr Schwarzenegger and the governors of Washington and Oregon have jointly backed a series of recommendations to reduce global warming pollution.
Judi Greenwald, Director of Innovative Solutions from the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, says there are various ways these initiatives could evolve.
"It could be that this just continues and we wind up with policy from the bottom up as opposed to from the top down," she says.
At the same time, many states in the Midwest and south, have not made any moves to tackle climate change.
Professor Stephen Schneider of Stanford University predicts it will actually be the business community that will push this administration or, more likely, the next one into international action.
A number of multinationals, particularly those with operations that will come under the Kyoto protocol are in favour of action, he says.
Some companies are already setting voluntary limits.
A number, including DuPont, American Electric Power, Ford and Motorola have formed the Chicago Climate Exchange, which allows member companies to buy and sell emission "credits" to help them meet self-imposed cuts.
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair says he will press the administration to re-engage with other countries on climate change, during the UK's G8 presidency.
But some commentators say that Mr Blair would be better off looking to the next generation of US political leaders.
Peter Frumhoff of the Union of Concerned Scientists foresees public pressure for action on climate change steadily building on the White House - but he does not envisage an early change of heart by the Bush administration.
Mr Uribe said he would then also be willing to release rebel prisoners.
He made the offer after meeting a man who walked across Colombia in protest at the plight of the hostages, among them his own son held since 1997.
The Farc has not responded officially but a website which carries rebel statements rejected the proposal.
"There will definitively be no humanitarian exchange with Uribe," a statement on the Anncol website began.
The president met Mr Moncayo, who was still wearing the chains he wore on his journey, at the protest camp he has set up in Bogota's historic Plaza Bolivar.
After speaking to Mr Moncayo, Mr Uribe addressed a noisy crowd of several thousand people who had gathered in the square.
He repeated his rejection of a Farc demand for a demilitarised zone in south-west Colombia to allow peace negotiations to take place.
"The only reason for a demilitarised zone is for the criminals to hide from the security forces," he said.
Mr Uribe did say, however, that he would be willing to create a special zone in order to begin peace talks and release Farc prisoners - once the rebels released their hostages.
"If the Farc frees kidnap victims with the help of the international community, the government will accept a zone for talks for 90 days on reaching peace," Mr Uribe said.
Scores of politicians, police and soldiers have been kidnapped and are held in secret jungle lairs by the rebels.
Analysts say Mr Uribe's proposal is unlikely to persuade the Farc to free key hostages they can use for political leverage.
Mr Moncayo has vowed to camp out in the square until the government and the rebels agree to swap prisoners, calling on both sides to end what the termed their "political game".
"Sadly our children, our loved ones are still in the jungle, Despite all the things that have been done, they remain kidnapped and we are here caught in the middle of this game," he said.
Some prices have now begun to fall - such as meat and fish and fruit and vegetables.
However the research group Verdict, which carried out the survey for the BBC, said the prices of some household foods were still rising strongly.
Neil Saunders of Verdict said the fact that price rises were not as sharp as they had been was down to several factors.
"There has been a good global harvest this year which has brought down the price of wheat," he said.
Many food retailers have been reacting to the trend of consumers switching to cheaper products, by introducing their own discounted brands.
However overall there are not likely to be major price falls, because there are still problems with global food supplies, the study said.
A survey carried out by the Electoral Research group puts the SPD up by two percentage points to 38%, and the conservatives down two percentage points to 39%.
A separate poll for ZDF television even gives the SPD - with 40% - a narrow lead over the conservative CDU/CSU coalition for the first time in nine months.
The poll boost is seen as a reaction to Mr Schroeder's widely applauded response to catastrophic flooding which has wrought extensive damage, particularly in the already struggling east of the country.
The SPD's poor performance in the polls over the last year has been prompted by its failure to make good on several key pledges - in particular a promise to cut unemployment.
But the speed at which Mr Schroeder donned his Wellington boots and formulated a flood action plan appears to have revived his party's chances.
His conservative rival, Edmund Stoiber, was on holiday when the floods began, and his own flood strategy has been less well received.
Mr Stoiber has also been wrong-footed this week by Schroeder's proposals to delay tax cuts in order to fund relief efforts, a plan generally accepted as correct by both economic experts and voters.
Mr Stoiber suggested the cleanup should be funded instead from central bank profits, but the bank itself rejected the suggestion, saying it would put Germany at risk of breaching European Union limits on budget deficits.
Most importantly, Mr Schroeder's plan and his activity in the past week is believed to have improved his standing among voters in the formerly communist east, whose support is crucial to electoral success.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is sending his top legal adviser to the country next week.
Mr Hariri and 22 others were killed in a massive bomb explosion in Beirut on 14 February 2005.
Lebanon's current prime minister, Fouad Siniora, backs plans for an international tribunal.
The mainly pro-Syrian opposition has reservations about the tribunal and is accused by the government of trying to undermine it.
Nicholas Michel, the UN's top legal adviser, will visit Lebanon on Tuesday to try to help the rival parties find common ground over proposals to set up an international tribunal.
"We simply want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to share his or her proposals, and make sure that at the end we have a broad support in the country for the establishment of the tribunal," he said.
The UN says Mr Hariri's killing was "probably" politically motivated and has implicated Syria but Damascus has denied any involvement in his death.
The UN has signed an accord that would create an international tribunal but the move has been opposed by Syria and Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said any Syrian suspects would be tried in Syria and he would not release them to a tribunal.
If Lebanon fails to ratify the proposal, the Security Council may consider independently authorising a tribunal as it did in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
Saad Hariri, Rafik Hariri's son, has urged the UN Security Council to bypass the political parties and establish a tribunal, if the Lebanese parties cannot agree.
It comes in the form of small plant fossils preserved as charcoal, which were unearthed by researchers near the town of Ludlow on the Welsh borders.
The plant remains date to the Silurian Period, about 443 to 417 million years ago, say a Cardiff University team.
Previously, charcoal was known only from the later Devonian Period, which saw an explosion in plant diversity.
But in the Silurian, plants were generally quite small, which would have restricted the fuel source for wildfires.
"It's amazing that there should be an accumulation of vegetation, either as litter or as living vegetation drying out - to provide fuel for a fire," co-author Professor Dianne Edwards of Cardiff University told BBC News Online.
The team used a technique known as reflected-light microscopy on a collection of well-preserved plants recovered from a dig at Ludford Lane.
The researchers also found other evidence that the fossils were charred such as shrinkage of the layer of cells, or epidermis, which covers the surface of the plant.
In Geology, the University of Cardiff team proposes that the exceptional three-dimensional preservation of the plants is due to their charring in a wildfire.
However, comparisons with the reflectance values of experimentally charred plants show most of the Ludford Lane specimens were only partially turned to charcoal.
This indicates that they were burnt by either a short-lived low-temperature fire or a smouldering fire that was only intense enough to partially char them.
This agrees well with proposed compositions for the Silurian atmosphere.
Oxygen levels are supposed to have been lower in Silurian times; about 18% compared with present-day levels of roughly 21%.
Professor Edwards said that the fire might have been similar to a modern heathland fire.
The researchers also found a charred coprolite - fossilised faeces - amongst the Ludford Lane specimens which probably came from a millipede.
The decision means Mr McKinnon will face trial in America for what the US has called "the biggest military hack of all time".
Although he has admitted hacking US military networks, Mr McKinnon said he was motivated by curiosity not malice.
The final decision on whether he should be sent to the US for trial rests with the home secretary.
The decision was given at Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London and ends three years of uncertainty for Mr McKinnon.
Mr McKinnon was first arrested in 2002 by the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit for hacking into a series of computer networks used by the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and Department of Defense.
The US in its case for extradition said Mr McKinnon caused more than $700,000 (�375,235) of damage while exploring the computer networks at various US military institutions.
Mr McKinnon has admitted that he spent almost two years exploring these networks but has said he was motivated by a search for what he called "suppressed technology".
In a recent BBC interview, Mr McKinnon said he had got close to getting pictorial evidence of technologies that could be of huge benefit to everyone but the US government was not releasing.
Ms Todner said she was worried that any sentence Mr McKinnon received in the US would be "disproportionate" to the scale of the offences he committed.
If tried and found guilty in the US, Mr McKinnon could face decades in jail and fines totalling millions of dollars.
Following three months of public consultation, Guildford and Waverley PCT's board is considering the future of Milford Hospital, near Godalming.
Campaigners are also fighting to prevent the removal of all 14 beds from Cranleigh Village Hospital.
Jeremy Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, said the PCT plans were "madness".
An extraordinary board meeting is being held in public at Guildford Baptist Church on Thursday afternoon.
It follows the PCT's consultation on its "Modernising your local healthcare" strategy.
Mr Hunt, the local Conservative MP, said it was "devastating news for Milford".
Haslemere Community Hospital's League of Friends group produced almost 2,000 protest postcards during the consultation period.
If the changes go ahead, the PCT wants them implemented by March 2008.
At home the TV is switched off - never on standby - the light bulbs are all low-energy and the loft is newly insulated.
This not only means improving technology but educating staff.
In the office pictured above, Mr Tibble recommends upgrading to a low-energy lamp fitted with a low-energy bulb, which would use a third less energy.
Fine in theory, but what about the factors employees cannot control, such as the air conditioning?
But what about those who work in factories, where employees have less control over the settings of their equipment.
At Marshalls, a concrete and landscaping products firm in Nottinghamshire, moves are afoot to save �40,000 a year on the �250,000 energy bill by educating the workforce, insulating machines, plugging the leaks in the compressed air system and putting a timer on the heater.
All of which saved 10% from the company's �32,000-a -month energy budget and 78,000 tonnes of carbon.
But like all environmental initiatives, saving energy at work will stand or fall on individual employee's willingness to take part.

The landlord of the Black Cuillins - John MacLeod of MacLeod - agreed on Monday to allow limited access to the mountains, reversing his earlier decision.
However, limited access does not go far enough according to protesters.
Local hotelier Steve Bailey will be taking part in the protest.
He says that they are expected to be grateful for MacLeod's compromise, but he is only opening a small part of the estate.
Mr Bailey, who owns a bed and breakfast hotel in Talisker and also owns sheep, also says the access that has been granted is illogical - it is forcing more walkers on to the roads where they do tend to encounter more sheep wandering about.
He and around 30 others will still be going ahead with their protest.
McLeod Estates on the island of Skye, faced with a threatened demonstration by members of the tourist trade, said the island's Black Cuillin mountains will be partially reopened.
In a statement, clan chief John MacLeod of MacLeod says he will allow limited access to the mountains.
Despite the compromise, the planned protest is still going ahead on Tuesday.
The statement said Mr MacLeod is on "the horns of a dilemma".
He said he had to balance the possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth against the major economic difficulties currently being suffered by tourist businesses.
But he said he was concerned there is a tenant farm in Glen Brittle, one of the major access points to the mountains and site of a climber's campsite.
He feared that a case of foot and mouth there would mean all the livestock on the island would have to be culled, destroying traditional farming and crofting there.
But he says he has considered his position with reference to various tourist enterprises dependent on being able to access the mountains - and he will partially reopen the Cuillins.
The mountains will remain closed between Sligachan at the heart of the island and Glen Brittle, while the camp site will stay closed.
The John Muir Trust have now officially re-opened the neighbouring Red Cuillins.
The partial opening of the Black Cuillins will see access through Coruisk, or through ground owned by the John Muir Trust.
There will be no access between Sligachan and Glen Brittle.
Edward Hutcheson, 39, was seen leaning forward to look in his rear view mirror as he used an electric shaver.
He was banned for six months and fined �300 after being found guilty of careless driving on the A9 near Auchterarder, Perthshire, last March.
He told police he was late for a first aid course, Perth Sheriff Court heard.
Hutcheson, who had previously worked on accident investigations with the police, also claimed he had been leaning across the car at an awkward angle so he could see past a dozen mannequins he had stored in the back of his car.
The court heard how police officers saw him drive past their patrol vehicle as he used an electric shaver on his face and crane his head to look in the rear view mirror.
They turned round and chased Hutcheson from the entrance to Upper Cairnie Farm, near Auchterarder, before catching up with him a mile further on.
He had one hand on the wheel and police said he appeared to be checking if he was "getting a good shave".
Hutcheson, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, said he was a health and safety inspector and was running late to deliver a first aid training course in Dundee.
Sheriff Michael Fletcher heard that Hutcheson stood to lose his job without a licence.
The sheriff found him guilty of careless driving.
"It is near the top end of careless driving, considering the conditions you were driving in and what was going on," the sheriff said.
Australian scientists have found that whale mating songs are picked up and copied by other males - sometimes thousands of miles away.
But if a song is judged a miss, it's dropped to make way for a new tune!
The scientists spent 11 years looking for patterns in songs recorded from six whale populations in the Pacific Ocean.
This happens during breeding season, when males sing songs to attract females.
But it's not clear why males across the ocean would want to be humming the same song.
Eric Manasse was instructed by Rangers' director of football Martin Bain on Wednesday morning to conclude the deal to bring the player to Glasgow.
But with those negotiations taking place, Manasse says Bain reneged on the deal, withdrawing the offer without explanation.
Bain told the BBC Sport website that this was a case of "a disappointed agent counting his fee before the deal was concluded".
Ironically, the owner of one of the companies that holds a financial interest in the player insists that Rangers' decision to involve Manasse in the deal was partly why the Scottish champions' offer had not been accepted.
"The player is heart-broken," Manasse told the BBC Sport website.
"After the game at the weekend, he had a glass of champagne with Alex McLeish and Martin Bain and was welcomed to the Rangers squad.
McLeish and Bain had travelled with Manasse to Argentina to see the player score five goals against Boca Juniors.
Ricardo Schlieper, whose company Investors Group own a 60% interest in Figueroa, told the BBC Sport website that the Osasuna offer was more attractive to them than the Rangers one.
The player's father, Jorge Figueroa, who is also his son's agent, admitted that they were disappointed that the Rangers offer had been withdrawn.
Figueroa was the leading scorer in the Argentine league in the season just ended with 17 goals.
He is currently with the national squad preparing for next Wednesday's game against Uruguay.
Priests in lavish robes, elderly warriors with lions' manes on their heads and dread-locked Rastafarians joined the funeral procession for the man some believe to be a living god.
The government had refused to allow the occasion the status of a state burial, having recently accused the former emperor of oppression and brutality during his 45-year rule.
The funeral cortege left Ba'ata Mariam Geda Church at dawn and followed a 10km (six mile) route to the Trinity Cathedral, via the main Meskal Square in Addis Ababa.
Haile Selassie's remains had been kept at the church since they were discovered under a palace toilet in 1992.
Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia for 45 years before he was overthrown by the Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1974.
When Haile Selassie was enthroned in 1930, he became not only emperor of Ethiopia, but also god to the fledgling Rastafarian movement in Jamaica.
Ras Lumumba, a Sudanese Rastafarian who came to settle in Ethiopia three years ago, says the Emperor is their Messiah or Jah.
The court ruled that a 1990 will that appeared to have been hand-written by her husband Teddy, and which left everything to Nina, was falsified.
One month after the will was written, Teddy was kidnapped and has never been seen since.
In 1999 he was declared legally dead and his father, Wang Din-shin, began legal action to recover his son's estate.
Mr Wang, now 91, stands to receive about $128m under the ruling.
Ms Wang will hardly be left penniless.
Since Teddy's disappearance she has built up his property company, Chinachem, into one of Hong Kong's largest privately-owned companies.
It was not clear how the ruling would affect her position within the company.
The case revolved around three wills.
The first was written in 1960 and would have split Teddy Wang's estate equally between his father and Nina.
In 1968, following allegations that Nina had had an affair, Teddy changed his will and left everything to his father.
This will is now seen as legally valid.
The 1990 will claimed to carry the signatures of Teddy and a witness, Tse Ping-yim.
Lawyers for Ms Wang said she was surprised by the outcome and would appeal.
The judge said the will provided by Ms Wang was suspicious.
"Why should Teddy make a home-made will instead of making aproper will by solicitors as he had done before in 1960 and1968?" Justice Yam asked.
The judge also questioned a phrase in one part of the will which read "One life one love".
"Why should Teddy make Document D with the words 'One lifeone love' when the evidence before the court suggested thatTeddy was not a romantic person at all?" the judge asked.
King Sihamoni, a former ballet dancer and ambassador to Unesco, said he would try to follow the example of his father, former king Sihanouk.
He also vowed to stay out of Cambodia's often troubled politics.
King Sihamoni was chosen as Cambodia's new monarch on Thursday, after Sihanouk abdicated due to ill health last week.
He is currently in Beijing looking after his ailing father, but both men are due in Cambodia next week and a coronation ceremony has been planned for later this month.
King Sihamoni, who has lived most of his life outside Cambodia, said he was "extremely touched" when Cambodia's Throne Council decided to elect him to the throne.
He said he accepted "this supreme mission" in the interest of the country's stability and to help ensure the monarchy's survival.
"My parents said they will show me how best to respect, love and serve our religion and people," he added.
He also promised to remain politically neutral, and not side with any particular parties or politicians.
"I will not interfere with the work of the legislature, executive and judiciary," King Sihamoni added.
Leaders from around the world have congratulated King Sihamoni on his appointment.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan offered his "sincere congratulations", and Chinese President Hu Jintao said that under the new king's leadership "the Cambodian people will surely make new achievements in national construction".
A statement from France - former colonial power in Cambodia - assured King Sihamoni of support in his efforts to "reinforce national unity and the economic and socialdevelopment of the country".
When Sihanouk announced his abdication last Wednesday, Cambodia was plunged into a constitutional crisis.
There was no legal provision in the event of a monarch's abdication, and laws had to be rushed through parliament to enable a throne council to convene and choose a successor.
While the reigning monarch used to have great authority in Cambodia, the position is now largely symbolic and wields no real power.
But it remains an important position because of the reverence Cambodian people give to the royal family.
He added that independent forecasters were moving to agreement with the Treasury forecast, and said that growth in the major industrial countries - especially in the United States - would be stronger than previously thought.
Mr Brown would not be drawn on whether or not the government wanted to lower the value of the pound, which many manufacturers believe to be hurting their exports.
"We want a stable and competitive pound," he said, adding that the weak euro was the main cause of the problem.
Mr Brown also denied that the increase in employers' National Insurance would hurt jobs - as claimed by business organisations.
He admitted that he had made no estimates of the employment effects of his measures, but said that he expected the economy to keep adding jobs in the future as growth accelerated.
Mr Brown confirmed that the big savings to the public finances - due to falls in unemployment and the huge cut in public debt - have largely been played out.
During the next Parliament, "there is not enormous scope for huge additional sums of money" from these areas, Mr Brown told the committee.
Debt repayments had already fallen by �7bn yearly, and lower unemployment saved �4bn compared with the year Labour came to power.
And he said that his figures would meet Europe's stability and growth pact -"on a prudent interpretation of the Growth and Stability Pact not taken by the European Commission but by the European Council of finance ministers".
Earlier in the day, the European Commission had criticised the UK for its growing Budget deficit and urged it to keep the Budget in surplus or balance.
Countries in the eurozone are required to keep their budget deficits below 3% of gross domestic product, but Mr Brown said the target should take account of the overall size of the government's debt, whether the economy was in recession, and the need for public investment.
Mr Brown was pressed on whether his commitment to the private finance initiative was building up "contingent liabilities" which might eventually have to be funded by the Treasury - but refused to give a figure.
For the Conservatives, David Ruffley, a former adviser to Kenneth Clarke, pressed the Chancellor to admit that taxes were now rising - and what proportion of the rise in taxation was due to policy changes.
But Mr Brown said it was impossible to calculate in detail how much was due to changes in the economy.
And he denied there was a �7bn "black hole" in public spending after 2005-06, which might be needed to fund further increases in spending in the National Health Service.
And he said he had kept to his promises made during the General Election - when he specifically refused to rule out increases in National Insurance.
"I have kept all the promises I have made and my party haskept all the promises it has made on tax at the time of theelection," he told the committee.
The rap star was set to play seven dates in Europe over the next 10 days, including the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and two dates in London.
An official statement said the musician had been forced to cancel the concerts due to "doctor-mandated rest".
"Lil Wayne extends an apology to his fans for the short notice of this postponement," a statement said.
"But [he] looks forward to returning for the performances and visitation with his fans," the statement continued.
Fans have been advised to hold on to their tickets and wait for details of revised dates.
The shows were due to take place in Paris, Roskilde, London, Amsterdam, Liege and Thurgau in Switzerland.
The 26-year-old rapper - real name Dwayne Carter - was the top-selling artist in the US last year.
His sixth album, Tha Carter III, was the first to sell more than a million copies in a week in the US, for more than three years.
Earlier this year, the musician won four Grammy awards, including best rap album.
He is due in court next month over charges of possessing drugs and a handgun on his tour bus in Arizona in January 2008.
The star denies the charges.
The resignation was announced as the cabinet approved the removal of a first group of Jewish settlers from the area.
Mr Netanyahu, a former prime minister, has been a fierce critic of the pullout plan championed by his Likud party rival, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been appointed to succeed him.
Mr Netanyahu had threatened to resign last year unless the Gaza plan was put to a referendum but later lifted the ultimatum.
He submitted his resignation letter on Sunday, shortly before the cabinet voted by 17 to five to approve the initial phase of withdrawals.
The three most isolated Gaza settlements - Kfar Darom, Netzarim and Morag - are first in line to be dismantled in 10 days' time.
Mr Netanyahu was quoted on Israeli radio as saying Israel should strive for security - but that withdrawing under fire would only make Gaza a base for terror.
The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem says Mr Netanyahu's resignation will give strength to the opposition faced by Mr Sharon but will not in itself stop the pullout from going ahead.
The issue has caused friction between the prime minister and his hardline rival for months, she says.
Mr Netanyahu, 55, is expected to challenge Mr Sharon, 77, for the leadership of the ruling Likud party ahead of the next election.
The Israeli prime minister said the country's economic policy would not be affected by Mr Netanyahu's departure.
Earlier on Sunday, two Israelis were injured in the West Bank when their car came under fire from gunmen north of Ramallah.
One of them, a 10-year-old boy, was reported to be in a critical but stable condition.
A Palestinian militant group, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, said it had carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing last Thursday of four Israeli Arabs by an Israeli soldier.
The army said the 19-year-old soldier had deserted in protest at the Gaza withdrawal.
The Israeli government plans to pull more than 8,000 settlers and the soldiers that protect them out of the Gaza Strip.
Israel is also planning to withdraw from four small settlements in the West Bank.
Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza since 1967.
But if you look back to the latest definitive check on the planet's environmental health - the Global Environment Outlook (Geo-4), published by the UN two years ago - what emerges is a picture of decline that goes way, way beyond climate change.
Species are going extinct at perhaps 1,000 times the normal rate, as key habitats such as forests, wetlands and coral reefs are plundered for human infrastructure.
So why, you might ask, are the world's political leaders not lamenting this big picture as loudly and as often as the climate component of it?
Has climate change hijacked the wider environmental agenda? If so, why? And does it matter?
These are questions I've been able to put to a number of leading environmental thinkers for a BBC Radio Four documentary, Climate Hijack.
Mike Hulme, who led the influential UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research until recently, believes the climate issue is rather enticing for the modern leader.
"The characteristics of climate change are quite convenient for politicians to use and to deploy both at a popular level but also at a political level," he says.
He argues that climate change is seductive to politicians because it is a long-term issue - so decisive action is always posited for some time in the future, at a time that can always be made yet more distant - and someone else can always be blamed.
So Europeans used to blame the US, the US would blame China and India, and developing countries would blame the entire developed West.
According to this analysis - and in contradiction to Al Gore's famous phrase - climate change has acquired its huge profile largely because it is a far more convenient truth than poor air quality or biodiversity loss or fisheries decline, where the actions needed are more likely to be national or local - and certainly more convenient than tackling the issues that underpin everything else, the size of the human population and our unsustainable consumption of the Earth's resources.
"I don't think it's a competition, actually," says UK Environment Secretary Hilary Benn.
In an ideal world, he would surely be right - all of these issues would receive the appropriate amount of political time and action.
But as far as the UK is concerned, there is a widespread feeling among environment groups - hard to quantify, and not always something they are willing to say on the record - that the government is only really interested in climate change.
And some say the balance has been tipped further by the creation of the new Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) under Ed Miliband, which removed most climate responsibilities from Defra.
This is a picture that Hilary Benn rejects; he says his department's doors are very much open to people bringing concerns about biodiversity, or about any other issue within his remit.
 which means this is where groups such as the RSPB are likely to focus most of their lobbying.
Former UK Environment Secretary John Gummer is clear that concern about climate impacts on the natural world is not the only reason why conservation groups are increasingly taking up the climate banner.
"I think we've got to be very blunt about it; campaigning groups for the environment or anything else are in the marketplace.
"So if you want to raise money to do something about the marine world (for example), you do it by campaigning on dolphins.
To a large extent, environment groups set the concerns of the environmentally aware citizen; so if they prioritise climate change, perhaps that means a loss of awareness of all the other things that people might be - or used to be - concerned about.
On the global stage, loss of biodiversity - in plain speech, loss of nature - is one of the issues you will rarely hear leading politicians lamenting - despite the fact that governments pledged to do something about it as far back as the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, at exactly the same time that they were pledging to do something about climate change.
Deutsche Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev leads a UN-sponsored project aiming to quantify the economic costs of losing the "goods and service" that nature provides - something, he says, on which the evidence has been ignored for far too long.
Preliminary calculations indicate the cost of forest loss alone dwarfs the cost of the current banking crisis - a conclusion that has been met with resounding silence at the political level.
A much more comprehensive analysis is due for publication next year; but he is not holding out too much hope that it will sway minds.
Even more difficult than putting something like biodiversity loss on the agenda, says former government adviser Jonathon Porritt, is getting politicians and the wider environmental community to accept that underpinning everything are the unsustainable size of the Earth's human population and our unsustainable (and rising) hunger for the Earth's natural resources.
Recently he raised the population issue in his blog - only to be excoriated by columnist Melanie Phillips for having a "sinister and de-humanised mindset" - which is perhaps an indicator of why other contemporary environmental thinkers are so reluctant to raise it publically, despite admitting its importance in private.
Nevertheless, he argues, the logic is undeniable.
Speaking recently at Mr Porritt's Forum for the Future, a Chinese government official described the one child per family policy as having led to "400 million births averted" - which she then converted into the greenhouse gases those extra human inhabitants would have produced, and noted that no other country had done as much to curb climate change.
"You can look to all kinds of alternative ways of reducing human numbers which aren't done as coercively as the one child per family policy was done in the past.
In contrast to the 1970s, the decade of the first global attempts to look at environmental decline, population is not now on the political radar.
Neither is the question of whether stopping that decline is possible without deep reform of the world's economic system.
Biodiversity loss, desertification, unsustainable fishing where are the spaces at the top table for these?
By singing the climate tune so loudly, have environmental groups unwittingly helped to create a situation where climate change is all that politicians and the public hear?
Has the media contributed? A couple of years ago I added up the number of articles we had written on the BBC News website within the preceding nine months about various issues.
The scores were four for deforestation, four for desertification, 17 for biodiversity - and on climate change I stopped counting when I reached 1,000.
In large part, what journalists report reflects what is going on in the big world; but have we, too, forgotten the larger messages of the UN Geo-4 report, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and other audits of a society whose environmental problems run much wider and deeper than climate change?
None of the people I interviewed for the programme argue that man-made climate change is not real or not important; there is no suggestion of a swindle here.
Some believe a narrow focus on climate is justified - either because they feel it is so much more serious than every other issue, or because they feel there is real political momentum to solve it now and time enough to deal with everything else once that is done.
But others argue there is no time; that society needs, urgently, to see the wider picture of global decline in all its complexity - and that climate concerns have hijacked the broader agenda, to the detriment of us all.
The disgraced tycoon Owen Oyston has lost an appeal against his convictions for rape and indecent assault.
At the Court of Appeal in London, Lord Justice Phillips, Mr Justice Jowitt and Mr Justice Moses also dismissed his appeal against his six-year jail sentence.
Oyston, 64, dressed in a dark blue suit with an orange handkerchief in hisbreast pocket, sank low in the dock as the decision was announced.
The former chairman of Blackpool Football Club was convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court in May last year at the end of an 18-day trial.
He had denied raping and indecently assaulting a former model in the early1990s when she was 16.
The trial judge, who said he had committed "horrendous" crimes against the girl, jailed him for six years.
He said the government had been faced with an unprecedented situation, with no warning.
Devon was one of the counties worst affected by foot-and-mouth with 173 cases confirmed and 390,000 animals slaughtered.
Monday's preliminary report from a public inquiry in Devon said there should be a national contingency plan for any future outbreak.
Lord Whitty has now admitted such a plan existed - but said it was only known to ministry staff.
The contribution arrived 11 days after a week of public hearings ended this month at County Hall in Exeter.
The report by Professor Ian Mercer, who chaired the hearings for Devon County Council, made 31 suggestions for future handling of foot-and-mouth disease.
He said the government should be "sitting round a table and sorting it out", without waiting for the results of the three national inquiries into the crisis.
"It does raise issues of organisation and communication that the government has to take seriously.
But he said in some respects, the criticisms were too simplistic.
He said there had been a contingency plan in place but that it was "not sufficiently shared".
The report criticised the decision not to vaccinate livestock.
But Lord Whitty said it could not have worked in the face of opposition from farmers - including those in Devon.
Vaccination in the Netherlands did not prevent large-scale culling, he said.
Professor Mercer's report said huge pyres of burning dead animals in the open should never be used again.
A vet had told the inquiry that burning infected carcasses had spread the disease, and another said methods used were "medieval".
The RSPCA said animals suffered in a way that would normally lead to prosecution, and evidence was heard of bungled culls and insensitive and belligerent Defra staff.
The report says a national contingency plan should be reviewed and rehearsed at least every five years.
David Hill, of the National Farmers' Union, said the slaughter had "frightened" farmers.
Fifty witnesses gave evidence during the hearings and there were 360 written submissions.
Professor Mercer's report has been presented early to meet a deadline for submissions to Sir Don Curry's national inquiry into the future of farming and food.

If you're new to wicketkeeping then an ordinary pair of batting pads will do.
If you're regularly standing behind the stumps then you'll probably find it easier to get hold of a pair of wicketkeeping pads.
They're similar to batting pads, but they are shorter and lighter in weight, making them easier to move and dive around in.
The northern Chinese province of Hebei, the country's largest exporter of frog meat, says it has banned the trade in order to combat the effects on the environment.
Officials say that widespread killing of wild frogs has dramatically increased the number of locusts and other pests.
Frogs - or field chickens, when they appear on Chinese restaurant menus - are a popular dish in many parts of the country.
Europe and the United States also import significant numbers.
In fact, official figures say the province's exports of frogs' legs have reached 2,000 tons per year - and there has been no shortage of demand, as "mad cow disease" has sent Europeans off in search of non-beef sources of protein.
And the rampant killing of wild frogs has fuelled a dramatic increase in the numbers of locusts and other pests ravaging the farmlands.
In recent years, Hebei has banned the sale of frogs in local markets, to try to clamp down on the trade.
There are similar restrictions in a number of other areas, such as Shanghai.
But local residents say that, despite the ban, frog-sellers still appear in the markets.
They sell their bags full of the amphibians to eager frog consumers, and then vanish before they can be caught by local officials.
The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe was never published before and contains characters similar to Holmes and his sidekick Dr Watson.
"The story shows that the idea of a Holmes and Watson story came to him earlier than we had thought," said Owen Dudley Edwards, of the Conan Doyle Society.
His first story published was The Mystery of Sasassa Valley in Chambers's Journal in 1879 but he sent The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine sometime earlier.
The story was filed and forgotten, remaining in the Blackwood files until 1942, when they were presented to the National Library of Scotland.
It was not published before as Sir Arthur's family felt it was not up to his usual standard, but following the death of Dame Jean Conan Doyle, the author's only surviving daughter, his family have relented.
It was among correspondence of contributors to Blackwoods Magazine including Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, Henry James and Joseph Conrad.
"The story is written with childhood composition in much of its style, and hurls down its ghost with the promptitude of an over-zealous dog showing its prey to an owner on first emergence from a pond," said McGowan.
But he conceded that it was a valuable contribution to studying Holmes, as it "possessed many of the marks of the mature Conan Doyle".
As such, despite the story's lack of literary merit, it will be of great interest to fans of Sherlock Holmes and the many academics who study the life and work of Sir Arthur.
Though Holmes is undoubtedly his most famous character, some argue that the writer's other work is neglected.
Sir Arthur - who died in 1930 - is considered by some to be the greatest writer of short stories in the last century.
"Most people think of Sherlock Holmes but he wrote many more successful novels," said Dudley Edwards.
"It is exciting to find this and interesting to see how Conan Doyle developed afterwards.
The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe tells the story of a ghost who appears to a landowner in a Scottish mansion.
"He paints a picture of the house dripping blood," said Dudley Edwards.
The book reveals that the ghost haunting the house is actually terrified by the ghost of the wife he murdered.
David Beckham, arguably the most talented English footballer of his era, would no doubt have been famous whoever he married.
But the choice of Victoria Adams, a member of The Spice Girls, the most famous pop group of the late 1990s, was manna from heaven for the British tabloids.
David was brought up in Leytonstone, east London, by parents, Ted, a kitchen-fitter, and Sandra, a hairdresser, while Victoria lived in affluent Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire.
It reached number one in 31 countries in 1996 and topped the UK chart for seven weeks.
Weeks after Wannabe went to number one, David seared himself on the public consciousness with a spectacular 50-yard goal against Wimbledon on the opening day of the 1996/7 season.
Within a month, he was in the England side.
The Beckhams say it was love at first sight, and David knew Victoria was the woman he would marry.
After dating for six months, David proposed, and their engagement made front page news in all the tabloids.
David's profile reached a new level during the 1998 World Cup, when he was sent off for a petulant kick at Argentina's Diego Simeone.
Victoria was on tour in the US with The Spice Girls at the time and he flew to New York to be with her and escape the English press, which was castigating him for spoiling the team's chances.
It was in New York that their son, Brooklyn Joseph, was conceived.
On 4 March 1999, Victoria gave birth in London, and the couple married in a castle near Dublin, Republic of Ireland, four months later.
The guest list included Sir Elton John, David's Manchester United teammates and Victoria's fellow Spice Girls.
Photographs from the "wedding of the year" were sold to OK! magazine while critics said two thrones, the centrepieces of the event, were garish and symbolic of their giant egos.
At the other end of the spectrum, David cast aside his villain status to rise to the position of hero following his free kick against Greece which secured England's entry into the 2002 World Cup in Japan.
Victoria could not travel to Japan to be with her husband during his triumph because she was already heavily pregnant.
Romeo James Beckham was born on 1 September 2002 at the exclusive Portland Hospital in London.
David and Victoria have always worn their "happy family" credentials on their sleeves.
His other works of body art include a guardian angel overlooking his first two sons' names.
And David's devotion to his family might have cost him the �10m a year he was reportedly earning at Old Trafford.
Brooklyn later showed he may have inherited his dad's footballing skills when he passed a three-day course at the Bobby Charlton Soccer School at the age of four.
In July 2003, David signed a �25m deal with Real Madrid, ending his time playing at the beloved team of his childhood heroes, Manchester United.
But in 2004, the downside of such fame reared its head when David was accused of having an affair and there were reports that their marriage was on the rocks.
With the completion of a potential three-part boy band, or maybe a future midfield trio, they seem to have put those troubles behind them.
Mr Bratton was responding to proposals by local officials who claim press photographers are out of control.
He called efforts by councilman Dennis Zine "a total waste of time".
Mr Bratton said that with key figures like Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears out of the headlines there was no need for extra security.
On Thursday Mr Zine, a Los Angeles City councilman, called a meeting with officials from popular celebrity areas like Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and Malibu.
He likened the paparazzi to "a pack of wolves, stalking their prey".
The three-hour meeting saw officials propose an emergency phoneline for celebrities and plans to licence the paparazzi.
"You are in danger," said singer John Meyer, who attended Thursday's meeting.
But, speaking at a news conference after the meeting, Mr Bratton rejected calls to create a personal safety zone around celebrities.
"What is this protected space that they are entitled to that the rest of us are not entitled to?" he said.
The police chief added that he thought the paparazzi had recently cooled their ways.
Earlier this week, actress Halle Berry accused a photographer of trespassing on her property to get shots of her with her four-month-old daughter.
In June, a group of surfers in Malibu fought with photographers who were trying to take shots of Matthew McConaughey on the waves.
French newspaper Liberation says Gerhard Schroeder and Vladimir Putin laughed and joined in the banter.
"One cannot trust people whose cuisine is so bad," it quotes Mr Chirac saying.
A spokesman for Mr Chirac said the report did not reflect "the tone or the content" of the meeting, but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial.
The three leaders met on Sunday for celebrations to mark the 750th anniversary of the founding of Kaliningrad, formerly known as Koenigsberg, an exclave of Russia surrounded by Poland and Lithuania.
"The only thing they have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease," Mr Chirac said, according to the newspaper's report.
Mr Chirac is also reported to have reminisced about an occasion when former Nato secretary general Lord George Robertson - who is Scottish - had made him try a local dish.
"That is where our difficulties with Nato come from," he said, apparently speaking before the meeting was properly underway.
The comments come as France and the UK compete to hold the Olympic games in 2012, and are at loggerheads over the EU budget.
"A man full of bile is not fit to pronounce on food," Mr Ronay added.
A spokesman for Mr Chirac dismissed Liberation's report as misrepresenting the focus of the meeting.
"The quotes attributed to the president of the republic in no way correspond to the tone or content of the discussions at the Kalingrad meeting," he said.
On Wednesday Mr Chirac will be flying to Gleneagles for a dinner hosted by Queen Elizabeth II to open the G8 summit.
The menu has not been published, but most of the food, provided by the Gleneagles hotel, will be locally sourced.
The monastery is a popular site for Coptic Christian pilgrims.
The restoration comes soon after Egypt's worst incident of sectarian violence in a decade, when six Copts were shot dead on Christmas Eve.
BBC's Cairo correspondent Yolande Knell says it is hoped the newly-restored monastery in Suez City will be held up as a sign of co-existence between Egypt's Muslim majority and Christian minority.
Speaking at the site, Egypt's chief archaeologist Zahi Hawass stressed that restoration work at the monastery was carried out by Muslims.
"The announcement we are making today shows to the world how we are keen to restore the monuments of our past, whether Coptic, Jewish or Muslim," said Mr Hawass.
The project has restored an ancient wall, a tower, two main churches and the monks' quarters.
Many of the websites, known as blogs or weblogs, have also posted news items from the banned publications on their websites.
The protest was started by blogger Hossein Derakhshan, a student at Toronto university in Canada.
He told the BBC that although he felt the action was symbolic, he wanted to show Iranian authorities "that they would not be able to censor the internet in the same way as they have managed to control other media".
He said he was delighted with the response.
The hardline Iranian press has published a personal attack on him, he said, "which is proof that the authorities must be worried by the bloggers' protest".
Earlier this month, three reformist websites - Emrooz, Rooydad and Baamdad - re-appeared in a stripped-down form after having been blocked by the authorities.
One of them moved the content of its site onto a blog as a means of getting around the block.
It is thought that the number of Iranians keeping blogs is now between 10,000 and 15,000.
However, some recent reports have now suggested that Iranian authorities are considering the creation of a national intranet - an internet service just for Iran - which would be separate from the world wide web.
This would potentially mean that users would not be able to access anything the authorities do not want them to see.
But Mr Derakhshan said he and his fellow bloggers are working on a strategy to get around the intranet, using email subscription services.
There were 2,538 people killed on Britain's roads in 2008, which is the lowest annual total since records began in 1926.
The drop came despite half of Britain's A-roads failing to be rated as safe in a European survey.
European road assessment programme (Euro-RAP) experts found 58% of A-roads it assessed were either neutral for safety or poor.
Department for Transport statistics, based on casualties in accidents reported to police, showed that 28,567 people were killed or seriously injured last year.
This was 7% fewer than in 2007.
It means the government has hit its target of reducing by 40% the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads by 2010, compared with the mid-1990s average.
He added that much needed to be done to cut casualties among groups such as youngsters and drink or drug drivers.
Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers welcomed the figures.
However, she said government plans to reduce speed limits from 30mph to 20mph in urban areas with high accident rates, and from 60mph to 50mph on problem rural roads, were not the way forward.
"The government must be careful not to turn back this progress with one-size-fits-all measures that hit all motorists indiscriminately, like a blanket reduction of the speed limit," she said.
Instead, she called for campaigns to target motorists without tax or insurance and novice drivers who are more likely to be involved in accidents.
Last month, the RAC Foundation said the UK's road safety record could be improved further through the establishment of a road accident investigation body.
Tom Symonds reports from one of the UK's most dangerous roads
The Campaign for Safe Road Design also claims 10,000 deaths or serious injuries could be prevented over 10 years by using better signs, lines and kerbs.
Statistics show the total number of casualties, which includes deaths and both serious and slight injuries, stood at just under 231,000 in 2008 - also 7% down on the previous year.
The number of casualties among cyclists also rose 1%, although there were 15% fewer deaths at 115.
Some 572 pedestrians died, down 11%, while 493 motorcyclists were killed, down 16%.
Peter Rodger, from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said improvements in both car safety technology and road design had helped drive casualty figures down.
"There's also been a lot of talk about the need for driver improvement which makes people more conscious about the way they drive," he said.
The Department for Transport is currently consulting road users, emergency services, local authorities and interest groups on a new strategy aimed at making UK roads the world's safest.

American and Russian spacecrafts successfully dock in orbit for the first time in 20 years.
A penalty 10 minutes from time from substitute Gaetano D'Agostino gave Italy a narrow win over Wales.
Jamie Tolley smashed a cracking volley to put Wales ahead, and they held that until almost the hour when Guiseppe Sculli equalised.
Wales have not won in five years and 25 games at this level while Italy's record is just four defeats in their last 30 matches, but given that record the home side produced a performance to be proud of.
The Italians have now won all three of their opening group matches, but the manner of their victory and gamesmanship left a bad taste in the mouth.
Wales stunned Italy with a marvellous goal on four minutes.
Adam Birchall pulled back into the path of Tolley, who lashed a rising drive into the roof of the net from 18 yards.
Italy's goal on 52 minutes came from a sloppy error when Matthew Williams missed completely as he tried to hook a corner clear, and Sculli lashed the loose ball home from the edge of the box.
Italy's pressure paid off when Michael Price pulled down Sculli and substitute Gaetano D`Agostino scored from the spot.

But the home side had to come back from 17-10 down at half-time after two Richard Fussell converted tries.
Despite a 29-17 lead, the hosts were made to sweat when Shaun Connor went over to grab a losing bonus point.
Two tries from Regan King and Phil John were enough to help lift the Scarlets into third place in the table.
Jones, Matthew Rees and captain Simon Easterby all returned to the side after being rested for the 20-6 reversal at the Ospreys, while the Dragons gave a debut to prop Nigel Hall.
The Scarlets cruised into a 10-0 lead inside nine minutes as there looked like there was only one side in the game early on.
But just as the Scarlets looked like they were going to build a commanding early lead back came the Dragons to score the two converted Fussell tries in the space of 11 minutes to take a 17-10 lead into the break.
First Fussell slid in at the left corner after Shaun Connor had set his backline going with a long pass, and he was over in the same corner again after good work by Jamie Ringer.
Colin Charvis and Rhys Thomas both went close to scoring tries before f Connor made it 17 unanswered points for the Dragons with a penalty in the final minute of the half.
But he missed a relatively easy penalty in the second minute after the break which would have given the dragons a 10-point cushion.
After Connor dropped a ball just outside his 22 the Scarlets earned a Stephen Jones penalty goal to cut the deficit to four points.
Just before the hour mark breaks by Stephen Jones and Jonathan Davies set up a converted try for Phil John to give the Scarlets back the lead.
That 20-17 advantage became 26-17 with two more penalties from Jones on 60, 64 and 68 minutes.
But if the Scarlets thought they were home and dry they were made to think again as a Shaun Connor converted a try cut the score to 29-24.
"It was very frustrating because we could have gone on to score maybe four tries in that game because we showed glimpses of what we could do.
"As soon as they scored a try our confidence drained out and we lost our way - it was another key half-time team-talk as there were some basics we had to put back into our game.
"In the first half some of our kicking was appalling and we put a lot of pressure on ourselves then we couldn't contest on our kicks.
"It seems as if we don't like being in front for too long and there were two or three instances where we kicked so poorly that we allowed the Scarlets back into the game where they were just about to disappear out of it.
Melzer, the 22nd seed, came through 3-6 2-6 6-2 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 after four hours and 15 minutes on a pulsating Court Suzanne Lenglen, and he will face Rafael Nadal in the last four.
"And I wasn't playing so bad, I just missed a lot of easy shots when I had the chance and the opportunity to finish the point.
Djokovic, who has been struggling with an allergy in recent weeks, ran out of steam alarmingly having sailed through the opening two sets.
When he broke serve early in the third a comfortable win appeared minutes away but, over two hours later, the 23-year-old Serb found himself facing two break points at the start of a deciding set.
Melzer, 29, had begun to take his serve apart but struggled to make his dominance count, converting only three of an amazing 19 break points in the first four sets.
Another four would go begging in the decider and it appeared that Djokovic might escape with his seventh win in eight matches over five sets.
Melzer's 24th break point of the day proved the clincher as Djokovic played a desperately poor volley when the ball appeared to be going long.
But the Austrian, playing in his first Grand Slam quarter-final, still had to serve out the match and there was more drama to come.
A stinging Djokovic forehand looked to have taken him to 0-30 only for the umpire to check the mark and overrule, prompting a furious outburst from the Serb.
Moments later, Melzer played a woeful volley into the net on his first match point with the empty court gaping as Djokovic, and the crowd, sensed yet another twist in this extraordinary match.
It was not to be, however, and Melzer became the first Austrian since Thomas Muster in 1995 to reach the French Open semi-finals when Djokovic fired a forehand over the baseline on the second match point.
"I made him come back into the match with my unforced errors and then he caught the momentum and he was playing really well, especially on his service games.
And despite being unhappy with the line call in the final game, the Serb admitted the umpire was not the reason for his defeat.
A secret Nato report obtained by the BBC says there is widespread collaboration between the Taliban and the military and police in Afghanistan.
The document is based on information from thousands of interviews with prisoners.
It claims that members of the Afghan government are joining the Taliban and the insurgents are receiving direct help from Pakistan.
Sami Sadat, former adviser to Afghanistan's interior minister, gives his analysis of the leaked report.
Social housing tenants could be offered discounts of up to £75,000 under plans to increase the numbers exercising the "right to buy" their home in England.
It means that for someone who has occupied a house for five years they will get 35 percent off and for those in flats, they will get 50 percent off.
Campbell Robb, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said that this is "not the kind of grand schemes to get the market moving".
He said that these assets are going to be sold off and the government will use it for so-called "affordable rent" which is more expensive than what people would currently pay.
Campbell Robb said that people are "a third more likely to get into debt if they have right to buy".
A sponsor has been secured for the first stage of the project, which would see a concrete slab put down in the walled garden at Beau Sejour.
It is hoped that will take place before the spring, and then work can begin on building ramps for skateboarders.
Guernsey's X-treme Sports Association hopes that when it is finished it could bring tourists to the island.
The scene in the court
The charges included rioting, vandalism, "acting against national security", and conspiring against the ruling system, state media reported.
Those on trial included members of the opposition reform movement, including a former vice-president.
Pro-government media reported what they say were confessions by some of the leading reformists.
But the leading reformist party Mosharekat described the proceedings as a laughable show trial and said the confessions had been forced.
The first court session has now ended and it is not clear when the next will be held.
Some of the accused, who had allegedly accepted the charge of treason, told the court their earlier claims of fraud during the 12 June poll were baseless, official media said.
Allegations of vote-rigging were made by defeated candidates and their supporters as soon as it became clear the president had been re-elected by a large margin.
Another of the accused, Mohammad Atrianfar, was quoted as saying that they should all submit to the law.
"We mistook certain irregularities [in the vote] as fraud," Fars quoted him as saying.
At the trial, pictures from the packed courtroom showed seated defendants wearing prison uniforms and with guards next to them.
Foreign media, including the BBC, have been restricted in their coverage of Iran since the election protests turned violent.
The BBC's Kasra Naji, in London, says the timing and scale of the trial came as a surprise and suggests Iran's leadership wanted to send a message to stop any more protests.
But judging from messages on micro-blogging site twitter and the internet, our correspondent says, the move may have the opposite effect, with several people talking about the need for new demonstrations and calling those on trial "national heroes".
Some of those on trial had been photographed "committing the crimes", and their accomplices were "on the run", Irna reported, without specifying the number of people on trial.
The defendants included supporters of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - both defeated in the election - and aides of former reformist president Mohammad Khatami.
Fars news agency reported that former deputy foreign minister Mohsen Aminzadeh, former government spokesman Abdollah Ramazanzadeh, former senior lawmaker Mohsen Mirdamadi and former Industry Minister Behzad Nabavi were among the defendants.
The protests were the largest mass demonstrations seen in Iran since the 1979 revolution which brought the current Islamic regime to power.
In the days of violence following the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad at least 30 people were killed.
Authorities also arrested hundreds during the protests.
About 140 people arrested at the time were released from prison on Tuesday, with a further 200 accused of more serious crimes remaining in prison.
Opposition groups believe the number of prisoners and those killed in the violence to be higher.
Mr Ahmadinejad is due to be officially sworn in on 5 August.
Clashes have continued since his election, most recently during mourning to mark 40 days since the death of Neda Agha Soltan who was shot as she watched protests on 20 June.
State TV said police used teargas to disperse crowds from around her grave on Thursday.
Could the pensioner vote prove the key to the successors in the forthcoming Anniesland by-election?
BBC News Online Scotland's Deirdre Kelly visited the Knightswood Community Centre where dozens of senior citizens gather each day.
The community of Knightswood has its origins in the mid-1930s when Glasgow's growing population was shipped out of tenement flats elsewhere into new and bigger properties.
Many of its older residents speak fondly of being moved from their old homes in Maryhill and Govan and into the "fresh air of the countryside".
"It was a good community, strange at first, but I'm pleased my family settled here," said Marion Hanlan.
The 69-year-old tells a typical tale.
Their children went to the newly-built schools, they shopped locally and received medical care at the thriving Knightswood and Blawarthill hospitals.
The other faces a constant threat of closure.
Knightswood's residents have aged to such an extent that it has one of the biggest concentrations of pensioners in Europe.
Many who are not natural Labour Party backers voted for Donald Dewar.
Jean Glen, now 80, would consider herself a Conservative supporter, but when it came to last year's Scottish Parliament elections she voted for the late first minister.
She met Mr Dewar when he campaigned to win his by-election seat, then called Glasgow Garscadden.
She hopes and expects Labour to win, but she believes the party has to promise Knightswood that it will not fail them on issues such as health and transport.
"The closure of Knightswood hospital did not go down well here and people are fed up with the inadequate bus services in the area," said 75-year-old Mrs Broadley.
Winifred Monaghan, 73, has lived in Knightswood for more than three decades and believes the candidates should say what they plan to do for the young people of the area.
"Youngsters have nothing to do around here, they are our future and the politicians should be doing more," she insisted.
The monkeys displayed their ability to understand the concept of quantity
In a basic numeracy test, long-tailed macaques were able to work out which of two plates contained more raisins.
Strangely, they only excelled in this test if they were not allowed to eat the raisins they were shown.
The scientists report in the journal Nature Communications that the animals have the ability to understand the concept of relative quantities.
But in this test, the monkeys often got it wrong - choosing the smaller amount.
Lead researcher Vanessa Schmitt said that this was because, rather than thinking about quantities, the animals were thinking about how much they wanted to eat the raisins.
"This impulsiveness impaired their judgement," Ms Schmitt told BBC News.
To find out if the monkeys really could judge quantities, the researchers tried another experiment.
"We wanted to know if they could simultaneously maintain two mental representations of the food items, first as choice, and second as food reward," said Ms Schmitt.
In this third slightly more confusing experiment, the monkeys were shown plates of raisins, but their reward for pointing to a plate was to be fed other raisins that were hidden underneath.
"They perform as well in this task as they do when choosing the pebbles," said Ms Schmitt.
Ms Schmitt's co-researcher, Professor Julia Fischer, explained that very young children had the same difficulty in suppressing their impulses.
"There's a well-known experiment called the reverse reward paradigm," said Professor Fischer.
Ms Schmitt says that previous studies of other primates, that have used food items to test their numeracy, may have been troubled by this effect, and therefore underestimated the animals' abilities.
Before the tie, Liverpool fans presented a banner of "friendship" bearing the names of the dead.
The gesture was applauded by many Juve fans but a significant number chose to turn their backs to it.
At the European Cup final on 29 May 1985, rioting Liverpool fans led to a wall collapsing at Heysel, killing 39.
The programme for Tuesday evening's match featured a two-page apology by Liverpool fan Terry Wilson, who was jailed for his part in the rioting.
All of the 2,600 Juventus fans at Anfield were given a wristband in black, white and red - the three colours of the two clubs - and many joined in an emotional rendition of the Liverpool anthem "You'll Never Walk Alone".
Some Juventus fans wore scarves with the emblems and colours of both Juve and Liverpool.
A minute's silence, to remember the Heysel victims and Pope John Paul II, was observed before kick-off, during which the Liverpool fans in the Kop held up placards to form the word 'Amicizia' (friendship).
Again, there was a mixed response from the Juventus fans, with some applauding the gesture and others turning their backs.
The Gazzetta dello Sport reported the efforts of Liverpool fans to "embrace" the visiting Italians.
"It was an embrace that died against a wall of indifference, which was unfortunately coloured black and white," it said.
Juve fan Alberto Schibona, who was in the Heysel Stadium 20 years ago, made his first trip to Anfield for the tie.
"We came here for reconciliation," Schibone said.
The two teams meet for the second leg in Turin next Wednesday.
Former Liverpool midfielder Ronnie Whelan, who played in the 1985 final, said he expected a night of even greater tension.
"I'd be more concerned about the away leg," he said.
Najibullah Zazi told a federal court in the city that he had been planning what he called a "martyrdom operation".
Zazi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder and providing material support to al-Qaeda.
US Attorney General Eric Holder said the plot was one of the most serious threats to the US since 9/11.
Zazi said he had agreed to carry out the attack as a protest against American military operations in his homeland, Afghanistan.
The US intelligence community has been under pressure ever since it failed to prevent an attack on an airliner bound for Detroit on Christmas Day, says the BBC's Matthew Price in New York.
Mr Holder said the US intelligence community had foiled what could have been a "devastating" attack.
"This was one of the most serious terrorist threats to the nation since September 2001," he said, adding that there was no doubt American lives had been saved.
The plotters spent months planning to attack the subway.
The US Department of Justice said Zazi flew to Pakistan in 2008 with a view to fighting for the Taliban.
But he was recruited and trained by al-Qaeda on the Afghan-Pakistani border, and then dispatched back to the US armed with the knowledge to attempt an attack on the New York subway system.
Last September he rented a car in Denver, Colorado, and made the long drive to New York.
With him, he brought homemade explosives, planning to assemble the bombs over the weekend, and hit the subway just after the anniversary of the 11 September attacks.
Mr Holder said Zazi was under surveillance throughout his trip, and the investigation was ongoing.
"We will not rest until everyone responsible is captured," he said.
Another two suspects - Adis Medunjanin and Zasrein Ahmedzay - said to be associates of Mr Zazi - were arrested over the plot last month.
Perhaps the most peculiar car launch at the Paris Motor Show was Jaguar's new XJ model, the seventh generation of the executive car.
First, the company's managing director, Mike Beasley, declared his pride in launching the model, 34 years to the day after the arrival of the first Jaguar XJ.
And then the marque's chief operating officer, Bob Dover, came driving straight through a hole in the wall in a Jag that looked like a stainless steel kitchen that had been bashed and hammered into a streamlined shape and given wheels.
But, of course, there was method to the madness.
The car had not been sprayed because Jaguar wanted to show that its body was largely made up of aluminium and magnesium in an effort to make it both stiffer and lighter than its predecessors.
"Now, that's some diet," he said, goingon to praise its various attributes in the way only automotive industry executives can.
But while he described the new XJ as "the most advanced Jaguar ever", Mr Dover must have been aware of the calls of the market place.
With looks that are by and large identical to previous models, it seems clear that the XJ would need something extra to make it stand out.
And although the weight loss offers improved performance, fuel economy and emission performance, even though the car is taller, wider and longer than its predecessors, it is unlikely that weight alone will do it for the marque.
Instead, Jaguar is thinking the unthinkable.
Apparently, there are plans to quietly slip a diesel engine under the XJ's lanky bonnet.
To purists, this would be an outrage of course.
"Jaguar is not about diesel," one Jaguar official told BBC News Online, while another insisted that "there is no diesel engine in this model or in any other Jaguar".
But commercially it may well make sense.
"They really have to come up with one soon," an official at one of its competitors said.
Jaguar's response is that as yet none of their cars will be equipped with diesel engines.
Though by 2004, at the earliest, an S-class diesel will hit the market, and the XJ may well follow suit, a French official revealed to BBC News Online.
"France and Italy have been calling for a diesel for years," he said.
Jaguar's competitors Audi, BMW, Mercedes have enjoyed great success with their executive diesel models for years.
"When you look to the German car manufacturers now, they are fighting against each other with the biggest statement, with more horse power, and these days a diesel engine car is as powerful as a petrol car," Saab Europe's Claude Makowski told BBC News Online.
Saab cottoned on to this just in time, if not even slightly too late, to ride the wave when it launched its first executive diesel 9-5 in 2001, four years after introducing a smaller 9-3 diesel.
In France, Italy and Spain, up to 70% of all executive cars sold have diesel engines, Mr Makowski said.
Lately, the phenomenon has spread to the UK where changes to company car taxation have fuelled demand for executive diesels.
Low carbon dioxide emissions are all that matters in the UK at the moment, one British official said.
The Germans have been convinced too by technological advances which show that the quality of diesel engines has improved dramatically.
Across Europe, diesel engines have become incredibly popular, not only in executive models but in small cars as well.
So at the moment, diesel cars outsell petrol cars.
This is good news, according to Claude Satinet, chief executive of Citroen.
"They are completely good, they don't make any more noise than petrol cars, and the reaction for the driver is exactly the same," he told BBC News Online.
The greater mileage per litre achieved with a diesel car has often made its advocates hail the engines as an environmentally friendly alternative to petrol engines.
But while petrol is a major CO2 polluter, diesel is instead releasing a wide range of particles which have been blamed for causing asthma, cancer or worse.
"We say that if you don't pay attention to petrol engines, you will be poisoned, while if you don't pay attention to diesel engines you will not be able to breathe," said Saab's Mr Makowski.
A solution to diesel's problems may soon be found, however.
PSA Peugeot Citroen's chief executive, Jean-Martin Folz, on Thursday announced that it has developed a new filter which will soak up virtually all the particles normally released by diesel engines.
"It means our diesel cars are as clean as petrol cars," Mr Folz's sergeant at Citroen, Mr Satinet, said.
In a meeting on Friday, executives from all the major car makers agreed to throw their weight behind the development of clean diesel technology.
"Current diesel engines are dramatically more efficient than conventional gasoline engines in terms of both fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions.
"Diesel engines also have the potential to meet stringent requirements regarding local emissions," the automotive executives said in a joint statement.
The son of a grocer, he began his career by selling trainers from the back of a van.
This led him to build up a chain of sports shops which he sold to JJB Sports in 1998, making over �250m.
By 2006, the Sunday Times Rich List ranked the Ayrshire-born tycoon as the richest man in Scotland.
He has given away millions of pounds to charities including Live 8 and the Make Poverty History campaign.
His promise on Tuesday, to give away �1bn to charity, is the largest single sum he has pledged and is thought to be the single most generous philanthropic commitment made by any Briton.
His pledge is only the latest in a long list of charitable donations.
He and his wife Marion set up the Hunter foundation in 1998 to support educational and entrepreneurial projects.
His largesse has also extended to Bob Geldof's Band Aid 20 single, which received �7m of his fortune.
And he pledged �1m in aid to help rebuild schools destroyed in the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.
The entrepreneur said he wanted his money to go towards the creation of an early warning system in the region.
He was one of the prime supporters of the Make Poverty History campaign and urged world leaders at the G8 summit in Gleneagles in Scotland in 2005 to use their power and influence to eradicate poverty.
Sir Tom also joined forces with former US president Bill Clinton and pledged an initial $100m (�60m) to the Clinton-Hunter Development Initiative to support developing communities.

She has also branched out into magazines and made-for-television movies.
Wish the games on that small screen were easier to see and play?
How about playing a game of Pong on a display as tall as an eight-storey building?
You can do just that on the huge interactive screen currently to be found on the front of one of Berlin's more famous office blocks.
A group of German ethical hackers called the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) have turned the famous Haus des Lehrers in Berlin's Alexanderplatz into a vast interactive display dubbed Blinkenlights by CCC members.
The group created it to celebrate their 20th anniversary.
The lights can be turned on and off independently to create a monochrome display eight pixels high by 18 across.
By dialling the Blinkenlights computer with a mobile phone, passers-by can play the classic computer game Pong on the giant screen.
Typically, players are pitted against the computer, but, if someone else dials in, they get to take over the paddle usually controlled by the computer.
When not being used to play pong, the display either shows love letter movies sent in by members of the public or movies created just for Blinkenlights.
The group has created a simple editing program that can be used to create and edit movies for the display.
Even if you cannot get to Berlin to see the movies played on the Blinkenlights screen, the website for the building is hosting most of them.
Current titles include a rotating 3D cube, Tetris and a recreation of the entire nativity story including angels and the baby Jesus.
The huge display caught the interest of antipodean pop star Kylie Minogue who featured it in the video for her song Can't Get You Out Of My Head.
Currently, the CCC is running a competition to find both the best Blinkenlights movies as well as the most useful software tools that help budding directors create films for the building.
The competition closes after Christmas, and winners will be chosen by CCC members attending the winter conference held by the group from 27-29 December.
The CCC said the Blinkenlights display would remain until February 2002 when it will be upgraded.
More than 50 species of amphibians of just about every variety of shape, size and colour that you can imagine thrive within the 112 acres (45 hectares) of pristine rainforest.
The herpetologist has spent years turning his patch of land into an amphibian haven - and the site now has the highest concentration of amphibians anywhere in Costa Rica.
A team from Manchester University and Chester Zoo, who are being followed by the BBC, visited the rainforest during daylight and after nightfall.
Here are some of the incredible amphibians that live in this mist-shrouded forest.
Andrew Gray from Manchester Museum handles some of the poison frogs
Poison dart frogs are one of the few amphibian species that come out during the day.
As their name suggests, these little frogs are highly toxic - and any predators who are not put off by their bright warning colours will either become extremely sick or die.
Brian Kubicki explains how glass frogs got their name
One of the Brian Kubicki's key species is the glass frog - a beautiful specimen that is found by streams in rainforests.
His research has focussed on the ecology, biology and taxonomy of these creatures.
He has been working on modifying and conserving the habitat around his research centre to make it an area where the frogs are able to thrive.
Andrew Gray finds a rare splendid leaf frog
These frogs are extremely rare.
They live high up in tree tops, and only breed in pools that have formed in the logs of fallen trees.
At the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center, Brian has created special tubs that mimic water-holding logs where the frogs can lay their eggs.
The high-pitched scream of the smoky jungle frog
Smoky jungle frogs are huge, and can be found lurking around the ponds at the research centre.
They feed on a number of different animals, including small mammals and even other frogs.
If anything disturbs them, they let out a high-pitched scream to scare off potential predators.
This is the lemur's last stronghold
The research centre is now the last stronghold for the critically endangered lemur leaf frog.
Several years ago, it was relocated here from its last known breeding site just before its habitat was destroyed.
Scientists on this conservation expedition are now investigating the genetics of this tiny frog to find out more about the species.
A jumpy encounter with the red-eyed leaf frog
The spectacular colouring of the red-eyed leaf frog has made it the poster-child of the frog world.

Official documents reveal a major 1970s' attempt to provide caravan sites unravelled amid major resistance.
Within a decade Whitehall conceded defeat as battles between travellers and councils continued.
A recent government report says Whitehall has still not given a much-needed lead.
In 1968, MPs won government backing to compel local authorities to provide caravan sites, a huge victory for Gypsy campaigners.
Experts had said land once used by Gypsies was disappearing, increasing the likelihood of conflict with residents and local councils.
According to the documents, placed in the National Archives, Gypsy campaign groups urged officials to force councils to provide sufficient "pitches" or to support willing private landlords as soon as the legislation became law in 1970.
Quick action meant hugely expensive disputes "could swiftly end", said the Gypsy Council.
But unbeknown to the campaigners, some local councils were also pressing Whitehall to do the opposite.
Authorities demanded exemptions, saying they had no Gypsies in their area - although campaigners claimed some councils were unlawfully evicting families as the deadline to provide sites came closer.
By 1971 officials diplomatically conceded to campaigners they were "under some pressure" from local councils.
"The time surely has come to end this unnatural harassment - this insidious yet pervasive action by the authorities which is undermining a whole way of life," he told officials.
Top officials privately concluded the act had become unworkable as Gypsy traditions were seemingly "incompatible" with modern life.
John Downie, a senior official at the Department for the Environment, told ministers to invest in education for Gypsy children in the hope they would be more likely to give up a nomadic lifestyle.
"Unauthorised encampments continue to grow and continue to cause worry and distress on as wide a scale as ever," said Mr Downie.
In 1980 the new government introduced more funding which led to a growth in sites.
But a report last year for Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott estimated the UK still needs up to 2,000 more pitches - and a further network of 2,000 places to facilitate nomadic movement.
It said ministers needed to provide "a strong lead" because there was "no clear, widely understood national policy".
"We are still pushing for a new duty on local authorities," said Andrew Ryder of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, the body lobbying MPs.
"That's not just having a negative impact on their health and life chances.
The replica of the Turing Bombe machines, which are credited with saving thousands of lives, is housed at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes.
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers is honouring those who made it with an Engineering Heritage Award.
All 210 original machines were destroyed after the war.
They were built by specialists at the British Tabulator Machine Company at Letchworth.
The replica Bombe was built after blueprints were found at Bletchley Park in the 1970s.
It was built with the help of funding from a host of groups, including the British Computer Society.
The devices were deployed across a handful of secret army bases in Britain where mostly young women would work on cracking and deciphering messages sent over the air by the Germans.

Commonwealth 100m champion Powell is unbeaten over the distance at Crystal Palace having run under 10 seconds in his previous three races at the venue.
However, Bolt, who broke the 100m and 200m world records at the Beijing Olympics, will start as favourite.
American Tyson Gay will only run in the 200m at the London event.
But Gay is expected to line up against Bolt and Powell in the 100m at the World Championships in Berlin, which start on 15 August.
Bolt, who was last beaten on the track by Powell in Stockholm last July, will run in the 100m and 4x100m relay at Crystal Palace.
The 100m relay was one of three golds for the all-conquering Bolt at the 2008 Beijing Games.
Coach Glenn Mills has assembled a formidable relay squad, comprised of athletes from the Racers Track Club, all of whom have recorded sub 10-second times.
Bolt takes Top Gear challenge
Away from the men's 100m event, world record holder and Olympic champion Dayron Robles will compete in the 110m hurdles.
Elsewhere, Jamaica will be represented by Olympic 400m hurdles champion Melaine Walker and 400m Jamaican champion Novlene Williams-Mills.
Williams-Mills will face Britain's gold and silver medallists from the World Championships two years ago, Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders.
"I'm looking forward to that race because it's where a lot of my competitors will be ahead of Berlin," said Williams-Mills.
In the Dinamo team, the 23-year-old will fill the gap left by Florentin Petre who joined Bulgaria's CSKA Sofia earlier this year.
No financial details of the deal were released by the Romanian club.
Kalanga started all three of Angola's group games at the World Cup in Germany and was named man of the match after their 1-1 draw against Iran.
Kalanga will be the only player in the Romanian league to have taken part in this year's World Cup tournament.
"Dinamo is proud to be the only Romanian club with a World Cup finalist in its squad," a Dinamo spokesman told reporters.
James Collins' goal cancelled out Roger Johnson's opener for Blues to earn Villa a point in an entertaining end-to-end encounter on Sunday.
"In football, will is as important as skill and the players really want to get back up the table," said Houllier.
It was engrossing encounter at St Andrew's, during which both sides created enough chances to win the match.
Villa struck the woodwork four times and Houllier feels the number of opportunities created by his side should have seen them emerge victorious.
McLeish rues sluggish Birmingham start
Houllier admitted Villa (who moved up to 17th in the table after Sunday's draw) are still in a perilous position in the Premier League, but is hopeful of remedying this after seeing his side score a last-minute equaliser to earn a 3-3 draw at Chelsea on 2 January and now come from behind again against Birmingham.
"We're not in a very strong position in the league so we have to fight for everything and we were extremely resilient to the end," he said.
Birmingham boss Alex McLeish also felt his side had enough clear-cut opportunities when in front to wrap up the game, in addition to having a penalty claim rejected by referee Mark Clattenburg.
"Craig Gardner had a wonderful chance with a volley which he put wide and he is a guy you would normally want and trust in that situation.
"Brad Friedel also made a great save at that point from Matt Derbyshire and we had the chance to turn the screw.
"But we allowed Villa to come back into it, and gave away a few unnecessary free-kicks and I was disappointed with the build-up to their equaliser.
Before the game, McLeish voiced his concern at City's failure to win any penalties this season and felt his side again had a strong case when Marc Albrighton caught the legs of Birmingham full-back David Murphy.
Jordan admitted Palace's 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Leeds Unitedcould cost his club millions of pounds in lost revenue.

Jordan demanded the football authorities drag the game into the 21st century.
"People seem to think it's a quaint thing when human error comes into playbut I don't.
"The monetary loss for clubs is so huge that you've got to startdoing things properly.
"Unless we start to move the game into the 21st century and stop allowingdecisions like this to be made, how can you say football is evolving?
The former Manchester City and Everton manager has enjoyed a distinguished career as a player and manager.
In a career which saw the Merseysider start out as a player with Everton, he went on to play for City and Norwich before being forced to retire.
In the process of notching more than 270 appearances for Everton, he helped the club to the 1970 League title.
A �170,000 move to Maine Road followed in 1974 and he helped City claim the League Cup in his first season.
With six England caps to his credit, Royle's playing career came to a premature climax during his time at Norwich as he was forced to quit because of a knee injury.
Royle's managerial football education began shortly afterwards when he was placed in charge at Oldham in July 1982.
Oldham were beaten in the 1990 League Cup final and in the same season, reached the last four of the FA Cup losing to Manchester United.
Royle guided the Latics to the Division Two championship crown in 1990/1991.
In November 1994 he joined Everton for his most successful stint as a manager.
Under Royle Everton reached the final of the 1995 FA Cup where they beat Manchester United - the last time an English manager won the prestigious trophy.
The following season, Everton finished sixth in the Premiership.
He joined another former club - Manchester City - in February 1998.
During his time there the club were relegated and promoted back to the Premiership a season later.
But his forthright style eventually cost him his job at Maine Road.
Royle will join the extensive BBC Sport team in Korea and Japan as a summariser.
His assassination is believed to be the catalyst that provoked the genocide which resulted the killing of about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
It has generally been thought that Hutu hard-liners organised his assassination in opposition to his attempts to broker a power-sharing settlement with the then Tutsi-led rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front of Mr Kagame.
The Rwandan government has rejected the accounts.
Exiled Hutu groups have frequently accused the RPF of the rocket attack on the plane.
They suggested the RPF leadership wanted to use the ensuing mayhem to seize power directly, abandoning the power-sharing agreement it had forged with the Habyarimana government.
The UN says the document was written by an Australian investigator, Michael Hourigan, who's no longer with the organisation, and was not himself sure of the veracity of his information.
"One individual committed to paper his thoughts as well as information conveyed to him and that went into a file," he added.
The UN has sent the document to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, where leading Hutu genocide suspects want to use it for their defence.
The Rwandan Government has strongly denied the accounts saying the reports are propaganda by Hutu exiles seeking to revise history.
Efrain Rios Montt, 77, briefly held power after a coup in 1982, at the height of the bloody civil war.
He registered his bid on Thursday, a day after the constitutional court overturned a supreme court ban on his candidacy.
Demonstrators had taken to the streets of the capital, Guatemala City, in support of the retired general whose campaign portrays him as an anti-establishment figure.
The supreme court had denied him a presidential bid on the basis of a constitutional ban on former coup leaders returning to power.
But General Rios Montt argued that the 1985 ban did not apply to him because it came into effect after he was ejected from office in 1983.
The general has never been formally charged with crimes but his 18 months in office saw some of the most ferocious fighting of the war against leftist rebels.
He was widely criticised abroad at the time for conducting a "scorched earth" policy, which wiped out entire towns suspected of harbouring rebels.
Last week, thousands of hooded supporters of the general violently demonstrated in the capital's financial district, demanding he be allowed to stand.
The general was prevented from running in elections in 1990 and 1995 under the coup leader clause.
Opinion polls show him running a close third behind business-friendly presidential candidate Oscar Berger and leftist Alvaro Colom.
Diplomats, however, believe the polls do not take into account feeling in rural areas.
The general's campaign is directed against the Guatemalan establishment and designed to appeal to the country's indigenous communities, especially the Mayan Indians.
It advocates "regularising and legalising all the ancestral land that belongs to them".
However, the Mayans were among those who suffered most under his rule when thousands of villagers are believed to have been killed.
The US state department has said it will be difficult for Washington to have a normal relationship with Guatemala if General Rios Montt is elected.
The bank's decision had been widely expected after it returned to a zero interest rate policy last month.
Correspondents say the bank is perceived as having done all it can to try to turn around the ailing Japanese economy.
The bank pledged to provide further ample liquidity if there were risks of instability in the financial market.
Economics Minister Taro Aso said a slide back into recession was a real possibility.
"If the economy worsens rapidly due to US economic conditions, and there are signs it could contract, we should not hesitate to carry out an extra budget," said Mr Aso, quoted by Reuters news agency.
He is one of four MPs running for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is a frontrunner in the race to succeed the unpopular incumbent, Yoshiro Mori.
The government used the word "weakening" on Friday for the first time since September 1995 to describe Japan's ailing economy.
The monthly report downgraded the assessment of several key sectors,including jobs, housing, profits and business sentiment.
"The economy is weakening, reflecting the slowdown of theUS economy," it said.
It determines that a visit to Jerusalem's Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon on 28 September 2000 - well before he became prime minister - "did not cause" the current violence.
But, it concludes, the visit was poorly timed and its provocative effect should have been foreseen.
The Palestinians have said that the unannounced visit to the site - which is holy to both Muslims and Jews - triggered the violence; Israel accuses the Palestinians of using the visit as an excuse to riot.
Palestinian leaders have embraced the commission's findings, despite disappointments that it did not back their demands for an international observer force in Gaza and on the West Bank.
The Palestinians, and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, have called on the Bush administration to embrace the report as a basis for resuming peace negotiations.
Israel has said it accepts the report, but says it will not halt construction in settlements in the West Bank and Gaza - areas the Palestinians hope will become part of their future state.
Moscow's annual festival of snow and ice sculptures, known as "Vyugovey-2002" (Russian for "snow storm") opened on Sunday.
The festival, which has been held for more than fifteen years, attracts artists from around the world anxious to show their versatility with this unusual medium.
The tribunal, set up 17 years ago to decide on a century-old dispute over sharing water from the Cauvery river, announced its ruling on Monday.
Karnataka says it will appeal against the order.
Karnataka Primary Education Minister Basavraj Horatti said schools and colleges have been ordered shut in the sensitive districts of Bangalore, Mysore and Mandya as a precautionary measure.
"The situation will be reviewed by the evening," he said.
The tribunal order on Monday brought parts of Bangalore to a halt with schools and colleges closing down fearing violence.
Security forces have been put on high alert in the city to prevent a repetition of anti-Tamil rioting after a 1991 panel verdict left 18 dead.
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have both argued that they need the water for millions of farmers in the region.
The backlash against the Tamils - a linguistic minority community in Karnataka - has already begun with theatre owners stopping screening of Tamil films and Tamil television channels being blocked by cable operators.
A state-wide strike has been called on Thursday and although its organisers say it is not aimed at any group or community, tension is palpable in the city.
Bangalore city is a major technology hub where about 1,500 Indian and foreign multinationals are based.
Most of the software companies, which had asked employees to leave early on Monday, have now resumed functioning.
The Indian constitution defines the Cauvery as an "interstate" river.
It originates in Karnataka, flows through Tamil Nadu, as well as parts of Kerala and Pondicherry.
The dispute over its waters originated in the 19th Century during the British rule between the then Madras presidency (modern day Tamil Nadu) and the province of Mysore (now Karnataka).
Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumarswamy has called an all-party meeting later Tuesday where a decision will be taken on contesting the tribunal award.
The Cauvery river water tribunal was set up in 1990 after the failure of several rounds of talks between the two states.
Dozens of meetings have been held to find a settlement of the century-old dispute.
More than a third of this was spent on the main Orange parade in Glasgow.
The reports said a "disproportionate number of officers" were being deployed with "no means of cost recovery".
Two reports on marches and parades - one covering police resources and another on violence and disorder - will go before Strathclyde Police Authority on Thursday.
The paper on resources shows that from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009 there were 1,061 marches and parades in the Strathclyde force area.
These required a total of 49,859 police hours at a cost of £1,714,374.
More than a third of this cost - £596,398 - was incurred by policing the main Orange parade through Glasgow on 5 July 2008.
The report also states that between April and August 2009 there were 610 marches and parades in the force area.
These required a total of 26,175 police hours at a total cost of £853,467.
The report "highlights the increasing demand placed on finite resources in terms of resource deployment, cost recovery and community engagement".
It concludes that "as the number of events continues to rise, Strathclyde Police is required to deploy a disproportionate number of officers on a regular basis with no means of cost recovery".
A separate report on violence, disorder and antisocial behaviour focuses on Orange parades in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire in the first two weeks of July this year.
It notes an increased number of common, serious and racially motivated assaults, including assaults on police officers as well as rises in weapons possessions, vandalism, breach of the peace and street drinking.
Adwy Eryri Cyf - Snowdonia Gateway Ltd is taking a "step back" and claimed lack of support from Gwynedd Council.
The company said it needed to update its business plan and would possibly consider another site in the county.
Gwynedd Council said plans put forward had shown "shortcomings" but it hoped for a public consultation on plans for the site early in 2008.
In December last year Gwynedd Council dismissed plans presented by two companies to redevelop Glyn Rhonwy quarry as a mountain bike centre or a ski complex, because of "weaknesses" in both plans.
The ski centre project, which it was hoped would create 600 jobs, included a 500m covered ski and snowboarding run, along with holiday accommodation and leisure facilities.
Gwyn Roberts, one of seven people behind Adwy Eryri, said it had now appointed a company to update their business plan.
"This should take about three months and afterwards we will look to the future," he added.
Mr Pritchard said he did not want to criticise Gwynedd council but said that his company had been put through "all sorts of hoops".
"We've had a knock with the (planning) process in Gwynedd so we've decided to take a step back.
"We do not want to throw everything away because we've so much under our belts.
Mr Roberts said this would cover an analysis of visitors to the area, including how and on what they spend their money.
The company did not need public money, and those involved with the company had put forward their own money, he added.
Mr Roberts said he would not be discounting the possibility of finding another site to develop in Gwynedd, despite the rather "negative" experience the company had with the council this time.
"We won't give up," he added.
A Gwynedd Council spokesman said the council had decided last year not to offer exclusivity on the site due to "significant shortcomings" in the submitted plans.
"The current suggestion that Adwy Eryri are considering the development of a new business plan to test the viability of such a project in north Wales seems to be a sensible one.
"The council is currently preparing a development plan for the site, and we anticipate that a public consultation on the proposed plans will be held early in the new year," he added.

People won't be able fly in it until 2006, but when they do it will carry more of them than a Boeing 747.
At the moment that's the biggest passenger plane in the skies, but the A380 - which cost around �6bn to develop and build - will overtake it.
Only the Russian Antonov An-225 transport plane is bigger than the A380 but that does not carry passengers.
The engines on the plane have to be very powerful to get it off the ground.
The amount of power they generate is same as 3,500 car engines.
To make back the money the plane cost to build airbus would need to sell 250 of the giant aircraft - so far they've got orders for 129.

After Fitz Hall hit the bar with a header early on, David Prutton fed Ormerod to fire past Paul Robinson.
Phillips then took advantage of a Zoumana Camara mistake to double the Saints' lead before half-time.
Defender Matthew Kilgallon headed his first senior goal from Ian Harte's cross to give Leeds hope - but they were unable to find an equaliser.
The game kicked off with Leeds already propping up the table after Wolves' win over Manchester United - while Saints left top scorer James Beattie on the substitutes' bench.
Home keeper Antti Niemi was called into action early on when he came out well to dive at the feet of Eirik Bakke.
Danny Higginbotham then headed wide from close range when Robinson hesitated to claim a corner, while Zoumana Camara earned himself a booking after bringing down the lively Anders Svensson.
But while Robinson had done well to palm away a 30-yard Svensson effort, he was eventually beaten just under 10 minutes before the interval when Ormerod ran onto a clever pass from David Prutton to drive the ball past Robinson.
Camara's afternoon got worse when he miscontrolled the ball and was robbed by Phillips, who sped through to claim his first goal since August.
Leeds had little to offer in return, although Alan Smith tested Niemi from the edge of the area soon after the interval, and the Finn made hard work of smothering Smith's low shot.
The home side, searching for their first victory in six games, enjoyed plenty of possession but with 15 minutes remaining, Kilgallon reduced the deficit when he met Harte's left-wing centre with a glancing header.
Phillips then wasted a chance to make it 3-1, shooting himself as Ormerod was left waiting for a pass that never came.
Robinson even joined the attack for a late free-kick, but it was to no avail as Eddie Gray's side faced up to their fifth successive defeat.
Their latest modelling studies indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years.
Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that previous projections had underestimated the processes now driving ice loss.
Remarkably, this stunning low point was not even incorporated into the model runs of Professor Maslowski and his team, which used data sets from 1979 to 2004 to constrain their future projections.
Using supercomputers to crunch through possible future outcomes has become a standard part of climate science in recent years.
Professor Maslowski's group, which includes co-workers at Nasa and the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), is well known for producing modelled dates that are in advance of other teams.
These other teams have variously produced dates for an open summer ocean that, broadly speaking, go out from about 2040 to 2100.
"The reason is that their low spatial resolution actually limits them from seeing important detailed factors.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN-led body which assesses the state of the Earth's climate system, uses an averaged group of models to forecast ice loss in the Arctic.
But it is has become apparent in recent years that the real, observed rate of summer ice melting is now starting to run well ahead of the models.
"Some models have not been taking proper account of the physical processes that go on," he commented.
"The ice is thinning faster than it is shrinking; and some modellers have been assuming the ice was a rather thick slab.
Professor Wadhams said the Arctic was now being set up for further ice loss in the coming years.
"There will be even more opening up, even more absorption and even more melting.
Former US Vice President Al Gore cited Professor Maslowski's analysis on Monday in his acceptance speech at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
They found that melanoma cells rapidly alternate between a round shape and a more stretchy "elongated" shape to help them move in different environments.
Two proteins - called Rac and Rho - are responsible for the shape switch, Institute of Cancer researchers said in the journal Cell.
Knowledge of how a cancer spreads could improve treatments, experts said.
The spread of cancer cells from the initial tumour to other sites of the body, a process known as metastasis, is one of the biggest problems in treatment.
Melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, is particularly aggressive.
Study leader, Professor Chris Marshall, said his team had been able to view cells in live tumours rapidly undergoing these changes in shape.
They discovered that when Rac is switched on it encourages the cell to become elongated and simultaneously suppresses the activity of the competing Rho protein.
Conversely, when cells adopt the round form, a protein activated by Rho switches off Rac activation.
It is thought these alternate shapes may enable tumour cells to deal with different situations during cancer spread.
Tests suggest that a round-shaped tumour cell may be better equipped to survive in the bloodstream than elongated cells.
The shape changes will likely be found in cancers other than melanoma, the researchers reported.
"This exciting study has shed light on some of the key molecules involved in the signalling pathways that encourage cells to move around the body.
In a report in the journal Nature, US researchers say they have worked out how black holes emit jet streams of particles at close to light speed.
The Boston University team say the streams originate in the magnetic field near the edge of the black hole.
They say it is within this region that the jets are accelerated and focused.
Despite the fact that it is probable that a black hole lurks at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy, astronomers still know very little about these celestial monsters which vacuum up almost everything in their path, even light.
Professor Alan Marscher of Boston University and colleagues claim they have delved deeper than ever into their heart.
Using almost every type of telescope known to humankind, Prof Marscher believes he has worked out where and how the jets - or blazars - are formed.
Using an array of 10 powerful radio telescopes, aimed at the galaxy BL Lacertae, the researchers studied a black hole just as it was sending forth a blazar jet.
The astronomers had suspected that the supermassive black hole was spewing out plasma jets in a winding corkscrew, and they say that their observations have now confirmed just that.
"We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet, where the particles actually are accelerated," Prof Marscher said in a statement.
University of Michigan astronomy professor Hugh Aller, who worked on the project, told Reuters news agency that the process of accelerating the material to nearly the speed of light was similar to what happened in a jet engine.
"We think it is focused by a nozzle of sorts and it comes out at us," he was quoted by Reuters as saying.
However, the BBC's science correspondent Neil Bowdler says despite this breakthrough, scientists are no closer to finding what lies within the black hole - beyond what is called the event horizon
In fact, if the theoretical physicists are right, our correspondent says, then we will never be able to see inside these strange phenomena.
The decision was announced in Geneva, where the UN Human Rights Commission is holding its annual session.
Nepal was facing condemnation over its human rights record, but a tough resolution looks likely to be dropped after the new agreement.
King Gyanendra imposed a state of emergency in February, in an effort he says to tackle a Maoist insurgency.
Nepal was set to be one of the key issues at the Human Rights Commission.
Human rights groups say the country's already poor record has become even worse since King Gyanendra dismissed the government and assumed direct power in February.
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says condemnation by the commission looked certain - but analysts say Nepal's agreement to allow in human rights monitors, made just hours before a condemnatory resolution was due to be submitted, means that has probably been avoided.
The UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour, and Nepal's Foreign Minister, Ramesh Nath Pandey, signed an agreement allowing the operation to begin immediately.
An office will be set up in Nepal to monitor the upholding of international human rights norms.
It will report regularly to the commission and it will advise the government of Nepal on how to promote human rights.
It will also seek the co-operation of both government forces and Maoist rebels to ensure that human rights violations are reported and investigated.
Louise Arbour, who herself called on the commission to take action over Nepal's human rights record, said she hoped the monitoring operation would help to break what she described as the "cycle of serious and systematic abuses".
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu says the new bureau is a major step in a country whose human rights situation has been declining disastrously.
The spacecraft, named Chandrayaan-1, will orbit the Moon, surveying its surface with high-resolution equipment.
The launch had been scheduled for April, but was pushed back due to technical problems.
The project will cost $83m and has the direct involvement of six other countries, including the US and Europe.
Over the next two years, it will survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and its three-dimensional topography.
The European Space Agency (Esa) is supporting the mission, supplying three instruments.
These will investigate the Moon's surface and near-surface composition, and the way the lunar body interacts with the fast-moving particles streaming away from the Sun.
Chandrayaan-1 will also drop a small impact probe on to the lunar surface to test its properties.
India announced its Moon mission in 2003.
It has also announced plans to send a man to the Moon in the next few years.
The government's lunar activities have not been welcomed by all, however.
Critics say it is "over ambitious" and a "waste of resources" in a country where millions still lack basic services.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was founded in 1969, and launched its first satellite in 1975.
Since then, it has developed a number of launch vehicles as well as satellites for Earth observation, telecommunications and weather forecasting.
Together with China and Japan, it is part of a fast-developing Asian space sector.
There are not many political riddles in Hungary any more, but one that has survived goes like this - how many years until we join the European Union? The answer, every year, is 'seven'.
The next level of debate starts from an awareness that the European Union must decide on its own shape before new members can be admitted, and there is precious little prospective members can do to influence that process, but sit patiently in the waiting room, adjusting their make-up.
A new study shows that the number of women being injured has more than doubled since the policy of making all recruits undergo the same physical training was introduced in 1998.
Lt Col Ian Gemmell, who carried out the study, is calling for a review of selection tests and training methods in the light of his findings.
Wales and south-west England bore the brunt of the snow on Tuesday, which is expected to move north.
South-east England saw further delays on roads and cancelled trains and flights, while gritters have struggled to reach some areas in the Pennines.
Forecasters warned more heavy snow could fall later in the week.
Council leaders have admitted stocks of grit have been massively depleted, but say they are unlikely to run out as supplies are being continuously restocked.
Although Monday night's snowfall in northern England was not as heavy as had been forecast, many minor roads have witnessed tailbacks and heavy disruption.
Meanwhile, a 16-year-old girl has died in hospital after being injured in a sledging accident in South Yorkshire.
Francesca Anobile, of Mosborough, Sheffield, was one of four girls hurt at Rother Valley Country Park, Rotherham, on Tuesday afternoon.
They had been using an improvised sledge which is understood to have gone through a barbed wire fence before striking another fence.
Snow was forecast to fall in eastern Scotland and the Borders on Tuesday evening, with further falls predicted for northern Scotland on Wednesday.
BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said the entire UK was likely to witness heavy frosts on Tuesday night, and there was a possibility of more significant, heavy snow showers in England and Wales at the end of the week.
"There is a risk of round two," he said.
More than 6,000 UK schools were shut on Tuesday, including 578 in Wales, 450 in Hampshire, 428 in Birmingham, 400 in Essex and 350 in Leicester and Rutland.
Authorities including East Sussex, West Sussex, Somerset, East Staffordshire, Dudley, and Kent also closed schools.
Authorities have already announced that nearly 40 schools in Wales will remain closed on Wednesday.
Margaret Morrissey, of the Parents Outloud campaign group, said the decision to keep thousands of schools shut for a second day sent the wrong signals to children.
"Many parents, wanting to plan their arrangements for today, will be pleased to have certainty yesterday of what was going to happen," he said.
• Two military rescue helicopters assisted ambulance services in parts of Devon and Cornwall as roads became impassable following 10cm of snow in some areas.
Meanwhile, trains on the East Coast Main Line were disrupted, with at least nine rail services between London and Leeds cancelled.
Services were badly affected on Southeastern and South West Trains into and out of London, with suspensions or reduced timetables on most routes.
Southern has now resumed operation of some services from Kent and the south coast, although suspensions are still in place on the London to Brighton route and others around Greater London.
The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said all operators should be running a normal, full-time service by Wednesday.
Eurostar services from St Pancras International are still suffering disruption and all train passengers are advised to check with National Rail Enquiries before setting out.
Transport for London said most bus routes were operating but three remained suspended, while all London Underground lines were now running, although experiencing delays.
Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and London City airports are all open but have suffered a second day of "significant delays and cancellations".
Flights at Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Southampton and Aberdeen have also suffered disruption.
British Airways said diversions on Monday meant many planes had not been in the right places for their departures on Tuesday.
The Highways Agency is continuing to warn drivers in the worst-affected areas to travel only if their journey is essential.
Those who do venture out should be well prepared, it said.
An agency spokeswoman said 500 gritting lorries were being used to keep main routes open.
All the main roads remain open in Scotland, which avoided the severe weather seen in England and Wales and saw temperatures mostly stay above freezing overnight.
The extent of the disruption to the transport network has prompted some criticism of the UK's preparations for the snow.
BBC transport correspondent Tom Symonds said it was clear that local authorities did not have the resources to cope - but he said many experts believed it would not be worth the extra investment given the infrequency of such conditions.
The Commons Transport Committee said Parliament's agreement to the 1987 Channel Tunnel Act had depended on the promise of regional services.
Preparations were made to run the services but they have never operated, they said, although the taxpayer has already invested �320m in trains and clearing routes.
The solution, he said, was either to take Virgin or another commercial operator up onits offer to run regional Eurostar services or subsidise them.
The MPs also said they found "no significant technical obstacles" to operating regional Eurostar services on the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines by early 2000.
But the business consortium that manages Eurostar said last December it was "gloomy" about the future of regional services.
Inter-Capital and Regional Rail also said in a feasibility study that destinations north of London would not be commercially viable until at least 2007 - when both phases of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link will be complete.
In December, Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Secretary John Prescott announced he would commission consultants to review the feasibility study.
The Virgin Group, which bid unsuccessfully for the Eurostar business, says it is prepared to operate regional services at its own risk.
The company said its service could start within six months and would include a daily service from Glasgow, two servicesa day from Manchester and one from Birmingham, with four trains a day leaving from Watford.
The MPs' report recommends that the government examine Virgin Group's business plan, and conduct its own research into the potential market, costs and revenues of regional Eurostar services.
The MPs said appointing Inter-Capital and Regional Rail Ltd to conduct a feasibility study "lacks credibility" as the consortium had already decided to promote a Heathrow to Paris service.
This was because, they said, British Airways, one of the consortiums members, has interest in the Heathrow service - and because the study took no account of Virgin Group's proposals.
Other recommendations in the report suggest that the government should look at the potential for Eurostar stops at Kensington Olympia in London and in Watford.

The young animal, nicknamed Happy Feet, is on his feet again and eating fish.
It's thought the bird took a wrong turn when it was at sea hunting for food - and ended up getting lost.
The sand caused problems for the penguin's digestion system and vets operated, removing sand and other debris which he'd swallowed.
To make him feel at home Happy Feet is being kept in a specially chilled room with a bed of ice to sleep on.
He is estimated to be about 10 months old and is 80cm tall.
A spokeswoman for Willington Zoo, where he's being treated, said he would have an X-ray on Wednesday to check his progress but would need more medical treatment over the next three months.
Hundreds of people have died from the effects of toxic gases which leaked from a chemical factory near the central Indian city of Bhopal.
Mr Y P Gokhale, managing director of Union Carbide in India, said that methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) had escaped when a valve in the plant's underground storage tank broke under pressure.
This caused a deadly cloud of lethal gas to float from the factory over Bhopal, which is home to more than 900,000 people - many of whom live in slums.
Chaos and panic broke out in the city and surrounding areas as tens of thousands of people attempted to escape.
More than 20,000 people have required hospital treatment for symptoms including swollen eyes, frothing at the mouth and breathing difficulties.
Thousands of dead cats, dogs, cows and birds litter the streets and the city's mortuaries are filling up fast.
The Union Carbide factory was closed immediately after the accident and three senior members of staff arrested.
Medical and scientific experts have been dispatched to the scene and the Indian government has ordered a judicial inquiry.
It is understood the Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, will be flying to the area within the next few days.
The union, which rejected a last minute pay and productivity offer by British Rail (BR) on Saturday, began its work to rule and ban on overtime at midnight last night.
Frustrated passengers were left stranded at train stations overnight as services, not due to arrive at their destination until after midnight, were cancelled from 2200BST yesterday.
The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (Aslef) is expected to join the dispute today, which will inevitably cause further cancellations and delays.
The chaos is expected to become worse as the week progresses as more than 20 per cent of railway work is carried out on overtime.
Barbara Castle, Secretary for Employment and Productivity, has made it clear the government will not intervene in this latest dispute.
But the government has said that contingency plans have been drawn up to ensure all essential supplies and services are maintained.
In major cities around the country emergency car parks are being opened and in London parking meter charges and time limits are being suspended.
The AA is operating an emergency control centre in Hyde Park.
On Saturday BR put forward a last minute deal which would have seen all but a handful of workers receiving a three per cent pay increase.
The NUR rejected the offer by 20 votes to three and is maintaining its demand of a nine per cent pay increase for all 300,000 of its members.
On Friday 5 July 1968 the work-to-rule was called off after the NUR accepted a peace offer from British Rail.
The deal provided pay increases for all the union's members - 10s a week extra for the lowest paid and three per cent extra for all the others.
Cristiano Ronaldo headed United in front after 26 minutes but Frank Lampard equalised before the interval.
Lampard and Didier Drogba hit the woodwork before the striker saw red in extra time for slapping Nemanja Vidic.
Ronaldo missed his penalty, but John Terry hit the post with a kick that would have won it for Chelsea and Edwin van der Sar saved from Nicolas Anelka.
It sparked wild celebrations for Sir Alex Ferguson and his players in the Moscow rain as United won Europe's elite trophy for the third time, a triumph made more poignant as it came 50 years on from the Munich air crash.
Ferguson had made it his mission to take the trophy back to Manchester this year in memory of those who died, and those who survived, in the tragedy in Munich in February 1958.
And it gave the 66-year-old Scot his second Champions League triumph, repeating the success against Bayern Munich in Barcelona in 1999.
Chelsea captain Terry had to be consoled by boss Avram Grant as he broke down in tears after missing the penalty that would have given his side the trophy.
He slipped in his run-up on turf made treacherous by a torrential downpour and sent his kick against the upright.
The penalty shoot-out capped a thrilling game with passages of play of the highest calibre, with United dominating the first half but Chelsea showing huge reserves of character, resilience and ability to dominate after the break.
United may have been fuelled by the fates, however, and they rode their luck before Sir Bobby Charlton - a survivor of the Munich disaster - joined the players in the ceremony as they went up to collect their medals.
The opening exchanges amounted to little more than sparring, but the game burst into life after 20 minutes following an aerial collision between Paul Scholes and Claude Makelele that left both players with a yellow card and the Manchester United veteran with a bloody nose.
Ferguson suffered penalty heartache before
Ronaldo had been giving Michael Essien a torrid time, and his threat was transformed into tangible results after 26 minutes when he soared above the Chelsea defender to meet Wes Brown's cross and head his 42nd goal of the season.
Chelsea were almost gifted an equaliser in bizarre circumstances seven minutes later when Van der Sar was forced to claw away a header from his own defender, Rio Ferdinand, after Drogba forced Lampard's cross into the six-yard box.
Petr Cech somehow denied Manchester United a second in the 34th minute after a stunning move that swept from one end of the field to the other in an instant and left Chelsea exposed.
Wayne Rooney found Ronaldo with a raking pass, and his cross was delivered to perfection for Tevez, whose header was blocked by Cech - who then recovered to make a magnificent one-handed save from Michael Carrick's follow-up effort.
Tevez was denied again four minutes before the interval when he escaped the attentions of Makelele but could not slide in Rooney's low cross.
United were left to regret their missed chances when Chelsea took advantage of several slices of good fortune to equalise on the stroke of half-time.
Essien's shot was speculative at best, but two crucial deflections off Vidic and Ferdinand saw the ball fall kindly for Lampard, who slotted in a neat finish - and his celebration demonstrated that the goal was dedicated to the memory of his late mother Pat, who died in April.
Chelsea were transformed by the equaliser, passing with purpose and looking the more likely side.
And the much-debated Luzhniki Stadium pitch was suddenly starting to exert an influence, with both Ferdinand and Lampard suffering from cramp.
Drogba had been a peripheral figure for much of the game, but he produced a moment of brilliance with 13 minutes left when he curled a right-foot shot against the post from 25 yards.
There was a moment of history three minutes from the end of normal time when Ryan Giggs replaced Scholes to make his 759th appearance for United, beating the previous club record held by United legend Charlton, who was watching from the stands.
Chelsea boss Grant bizarrely left it until two minutes into extra-time to make his first change, sending on Salomon Kalou for the disappointing Florent Malouda.
The woodwork denied Chelsea again seconds later when a superbly disguised pass from Michael Ballack set up Lampard, but his shot rebounded to safety off the bar with Van der Sar beaten.
United were left cursing 10 minutes into extra time when Chelsea captain Terry headed off the line miraculously from Giggs after Patrice Evra had shown pace and strength to fashion the opening.
Rooney had suffered a frustrating evening, and he looked less than satisfied when he was hauled off as United introduced the pace and unpredictability of Nani.
Drogba was sent off four minutes from the end of extra time by Slovakian referee Lubos Michel for slapping Vidic after an ugly melee developed when Chelsea felt Tevez had been unsporting in returning the ball after a break for players to be treated for cramp.
Tevez and Carrick were on target for United as the shoot-out started, with Ballack and Juliano Belletti following suit for Chelsea.
Ronaldo then made a hash of his effort, stopping in his run-up before seeing his kick saved by Cech.
Scenes in Manchester as United win
Lampard was successful from the spot and Owen Hargreaves scored under pressure before Ashley Cole's penalty took Chelsea to the brink of victory.
Nani scored to prolong the tension, but with defeat staring United in the face, Terry threw them a lifeline with his miss.
Substitutes Anderson and Kalou traded successful kicks before Giggs threw all the responsibility on Anelka as the shoot-out reached sudden death - and it proved too much for the striker, who saw his penalty palmed away by Van der Sar to crown United as kings of European football once again.
Live commentary from BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.
Although founded on the banks of the Mooi River in 1837, the city is robbed of much of its charm by the highway that cuts straight through the middle of it.
If rain stops play at the cricket, then the four museums in the town, as well as the Nederduitsch Hervormde Church and the City Hall, offer visitors a glimpse into Potchefstroom's history.
Just 30km from "Potch", as the locals call it, is the site of the world's largest and oldest ever recorded meteorite impact and it's well worth spending a day visiting the 90km wide and 2,000 million-year-old crater.
To date, the North West Cricket Stadium has held just three one-day internationals with it's first fixture being as recently as October 2000 when South Africa hosted New Zealand in a rain-affected day-night encounter.
He has been accused by police of murder, kidnapping, bank robbery, gun-running and putting the state at risk by planning to secede the oil-rich delta region from Nigeria.
Now his brother has told the BBC about the early life of the man who helped turn a gang of unruly thugs into a well-publicised movement.
Charles Okah says they grew up in a privileged family who had no contact with the Delta until their late teens.
While Charles qualified as an engineer and went to work in the oil industry, Henry went deeper into "activism", fighting the oil companies.
Henry's first real steps toward the rebels came in the 1990s when Henry got a job selling licensed guns to Lagos home-owners.
He got the licences from the police, Charles says, and claims it was a legitimate business.
He denies any knowledge of where the guns came from, but at the time Henry had been working for the Nigerian merchant navy for some years.
"Like any business in Nigeria, he saw an opportunity and had a connection," Charles said.
Henry was a successful salesman because he'd paint a graphic picture of what happened during an armed robbery and customers would hand over the cash.
Now his brother has been extradited from Angola on gun-running charges.
Mr Okah, 42, has not been seen since arriving back in Nigeria last week.
Mend said they heard he was killed by security forces, prompting a denial by the government.
His lawyers filed papers in an Abuja court Thursday in an attempt to have him charged or released.
Observers say that with Okah's media-savvy guidance, Mend transformed itself from a band of poorly organised thugs into a operation that had well organised propaganda and appeared to have a political mission.
They notified journalists of attacks moments after they occurred, and emailed pictures of hostages to newsdesks around the world.
Its a far cry from when Henry and Charles were growing up in privileged Lagos society.
The children of a successful Navy officer, they lived among the wealthy elite of early post-independence Nigeria.
Charles remembers a very "British" upbringing.
They went to private schools, and had never visited their family village in Bayelsa state, where the oil industry was then developing.
Henry, The fourth of nine children, enjoyed adventure comics and read Commando magazine, according to older brother Charles.
But when it came down to it neither of the brothers followed his father into the military.
Good at literature as well as working with his hands, Henry had many offers from universities but chose to go to nautical engineering college and into the merchant navy.
"I was always the quieter brother, Henry was the adventurous one," Charles said.
Charles himself went from engineering college to work for a company making floating docks for the oil industry.
It may seem ironic that the brothers would end up on different sides of the divide, but in Nigeria the oil industry is one of the only areas of employment for educated middle-class graduates.
It was not until Henry was 19 and their mother died that they visited their family home in the creeks of Bayelsa.
Henry told his brother how shocked he was at the living conditions they saw when they arrived in the family home of Ammasoma.
The execution of Delta activist Ken Saro Wiwa by Nigeria's military government in 1995 affected Henry very badly, his brother said.
But government sources balk at the comparison with Saro Wiwa, who has become a byword for the struggle of the little man against powerful interests.
They say Mr Okah is an international arms dealer who has used guns to get control of a group of criminals, and exploited the situation for his own means.
The Police on Thursday said he was being interrogated about murders, kidnappings, bank robberies, in addition to the accusations of gun-running.
But Charles Okah says he is surprised at some of the things he reads in the papers about his brother.
Charles spoke to his brother just before he was arrested in Angola in September.
Interpol says Okah and a friend, Edward Atatah -a captain in the merchant navy- were buying explosives in Angola when they were stopped.
But Charles says they were there to buy a second hand trawler for Okah's marine engineering consultancy.
He added Henry was "travelling on his real passport" because he had been visited by top-ranking members of the government in August and believed there was nothing to fear.
But then he denied Henry ever had a false passport.
The way Charles talks, it is clear he knows his brother was deeply involved with militancy.
He knew Henry was being hunted by the security services over a year ago, when Henry turned up unannounced at their father's funeral.
"He comes and goes, I don't know how," he says.
Even if he is still alive, it is unlikely he will be released on any kind of bail.
The effect on the Delta of taking Okah out of circulation is unclear.
His arrest and the mystery around his current whereabouts has heightened tension there.
But security analysts say the future is bleak anyway.
Mr Goh said the hunt-down which led to the arrests last month may have missed "quite a few" members of the group.
The tape was found in the rubble of a house in Afghanistan belonging to a leader of al-Qaeda - the terror network blamed for the attacks on the United States.
A government statement said the suspects had worked out two plans which were "ready for activation".
One plan was to blow up a shuttle bus carrying US personnel between a naval base and a local underground station.
Another was to bomb US naval vessels off Singapore.
The prime minister said more could be at large.
The 13 men are being held under the country's controversial internal security act, which allows for detention without trial for up to two years.
The government has said the suspected militants belonged to a group called Jemaah Islamiah, which it said was part of a larger network with cells in Malaysia and Indonesia.
The tape which led to the arrests features a man describing how easy it was to carry explosives on a bicycle without arousing suspicion.
He is filmed in Singapore with the camera zooming in on alleged targets, including a commuter train station.
Then it focuses on a bicycle bay at the station, where bicycles are shown with boxes mounted in the back.
"These are the same type of boxes which we intend to use," Bin Abas says, apparently referring to where explosives would be hidden.
He also mentions making use of a drainage hole in the curb of a street adjacent to a nearby temple and across from the train station.
One of the lawyers said the men were taking this action because they had not been properly informed of the rejection of their earlier appeal.
But a Bali court official said the legal limit of one appeal had already been exceeded.
Officials have previously said the three men would be shot dead in early November; no date has been announced.
The men - Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron (Mukhlas) - were sentenced to death five years ago for their role in bomb attacks in the tourist bars of Bali which killed 202 people.
They have often said they welcomed death, while filing numerous appeals.
"We have lodged an appeal because we haven't received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal," lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi said.
The Supreme Court will decide whether to proceed with the appeal.
The Attorney General's office said on Saturday that the execution of the men, who have been on death row since 2003, was "very close".
The three convicted men have expressed the hope that their execution will provoke revenge attacks.
Although sympathy for the bombers is low across Indonesia, officials are concerned that the executions of men claiming an Islamic mandate for their deeds could spark protests.
Sidney Jones of the International Crisis Group, an expert on Indonesia and terrorism, said it was unlikely that the executions would spark another bomb attack as the regional militant group Jemaah Islamiah had been severely weakened.

The draft details which materials Iran would be banned from acquiring under possible Security Council sanctions.
It also threatens Iran with unspecified actions if it does not suspend its enrichment of uranium, but is narrower in scope than previous drafts.
Russia and China both said early drafts were too restrictive on Tehran.
Earlier this week talks in Paris between diplomats from the five permanent UN Security Council members and Germany ended with no agreement.
But diplomats, including US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, have suggested that negotiations are making progress.
The new draft still would ban the supply of materials and technology that could contribute to Iran's nuclear and missile programs.
But it spells out in much greater detail exactly what items are prohibited.
It is said to retain a travel ban and the freezing of assets of individuals, companies and organizations involved with the Iranian programmes, a measure that was opposed by Russia.
Both Russia and China have direct financial concerns in Iran.
Russia is building a nuclear power station in the country and China has significant oil interests in Iran.
However, European diplomats hope to put this resolution to a vote by Christmas.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has threatened to reconsider relations with those countries who support sanctions.
Its figures suggest overall traffic in March 2009 was down 15%, with passenger numbers reduced by 70% at Blackpool Airport and 50% at Durham Tees Valley.
The AOA blamed budget carriers for squeezing costs, but airlines say extra charges have forced travellers away.
The government said it was committed to helping business during the downturn.
Airports have insisted that a shortfall in income has forced them to introduce extra charges for services such as fast-track security or car drop-offs for passengers.
Smaller airports had seen fewer passengers than expected through the winter, said Neil Pakey of the AOA.
Neil Pakey from the AOA says regional airports are up against a competitive European market
"There's no doubt about it, most budgets haven't been met.
"What it has done is its made airports more inventive than they have been before bringing in new types of projects, the fast lane initiative through security or priority lane is just one of those, these are designed not to be mandatory in most cases but to give the passengers additional choice," Mr Pakey said.
The Air Transport Users Council believes passengers will be targeted with more charges, but a spokesman said the organisation would take it up with the airports concerned.
Budget airlines have complained that the charges are driving more passengers away and they may stop operating out of airports that charge excessively.
Easyjet spokesman Andrew McConnell said the additional fees were "unfair".
The AOA said the government needed to step in to help small airports.
However, a spokesperson for the Department for Transport denied that an increased security burden was responsible.
"Regional airports are important because of the travel opportunities they offer local people, their contribution to the economy and as local employers," the spokesperson said.
The Treasury said it was right that the industry "pays its fair share through taxation".
Portable x-ray machines and metal detectors will be randomly placed at stations to catch anyone carrying weapons.
Essex Police, British Transport Police and c2c Rail are launching the joint operation which will last all summer.
It follows trials at underground stations in London.
Some portable metal detectors will also by carried by officers on trains.
"If they don't wish to take the opportunity, they risk prosecution or even prison.
As the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 twin towers attack reminds the world of the dangers, David Capitanchik stressed the need for constant alertness.
Aberdeen and Peterhead are major hubs of the oil and gas industry, and the Royal Family often stay at Balmoral.
Aberdeen is known as Europe's oil capital, Peterhead houses the St Fergus gas terminal, the Royal Family's Balmoral Castle and Birkhall are in Royal Deeside, and the RAF has bases at Lossiemouth and Kinloss.
Meanwhile, thousands of tourists are drawn by the entire area's history, wildlife, scenery and whiskies.
Aberdeen-based expert Mr Capitanchik is a renowned voice on terrorism and security.
"You cannot afford to take the view that because we live in a remote area a terror group will not decide it's a place to attack.
"If as time goes on no attack happens there's a danger that resources get diverted elsewhere and we could be at greater risk.
Mr Capitanchik urged smaller companies to do likewise and take every precaution possible, rather than assuming they are not targets.
"The RAF could also be a target but they tend to be pretty well looked after.
"The Nimrods are a major arm in our role, so might make them or the people in the local vicinity vulnerable.
"Aberdeen Harbour is much better protected than it used to be, and the airport is pretty well protected.
"Universities and colleges need to keep an open eye on what is happening on their campuses.
"The 9/11 attacks really shook the world - novel terrorist ideas came as something of a shock.
"You should not be frightened to report anything you think is suspicious as people can be reluctant.
"There is a need for people to be more aware of what's going on around them.
On the tourist front, the north east of Scotland and Northern Isles are said to be vibrant in the wake of 9/11.
"But visitor figures have recovered since then and we are now seeing an increasing number of Americans choosing to come to Scotland on holiday.
"Scotland has long enjoyed strong connections with America, with some 11 million Americans currently claiming Scottish ancestry.

Many have been dubbed Mr Koizumi's "assassins" by the Japanese media because they are standing against more than 20 former members of the prime minister's own party, whom he wants removed from parliament.
Mr Koizumi is so keen to get rid of the rebels because they voted down a key reform proposal last month and he banned them from running for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a result.
The "assassins", also dubbed "female ninjas", include Satsuki Katayama, a former Miss Tokyo University turned finance ministry bureaucrat, and Environment Minister Yuriko Koike, a household name as a one-time news anchorwoman.
He has taken up the prime minister's mantra with zeal - he and his supporters wear T-shirts printed with the Japanese word for "reform" - and although he is not running as an LDP candidate, Mr Koizumi is not putting up an LDP candidate against him.
While Mr Koizumi's prot�g�s undoubtedly have popular appeal, many lack formal political experience and local knowledge, having been parachuted in to fight key constituencies.
Makiko Fujino, a celebrity chef whom Mr Koizumi is hoping will unseat the Democratic Party (DPJ) incumbent in South Nagoya, has freely admitted that she cannot debate on any subject except food.
Mr Koizumi's strategy is risky because the electorate, faced with a choice between inexperienced LDP candidates and former LDP members with now limited political clout, may hand their votes to the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
But the prime minister is taking the risk because he views the election as a referendum on his bid to reform Japan's behemoth-like postal service, a proposal the LDP rebels had blocked.
Mr Koizumi also wants a modernised LDP, one prepared to vote through reform at the expense of vested interests.
That new LDP would also potentially count far more women among its ranks - most of Mr Koizumi's "assassins" are female, and the ruling party has also put women top of all 11 proportional-representation blocks.
What is not disputed is that Mr Koizumi's plan has sparked unprecedented public interest in Sunday's election - no mean feat in a country where half a century of almost unbroken rule by the LDP has turned many of the electorate off politics.
Ofcom rules say show sponsors must be clearly identified and not allowed to influence the content of programmes.
A Home Office spokesman said he was confident Ofcom rules were followed.
Another programme called Border Force, about the work of the UK Border Agency, is due to be shown on Sky One later this month.
"The Home Office does not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and adhere to Ofcom's strict guidelines on this kind of programme," the spokesman said.
According to the Sunday Telegraph, however, programme makers erred in allowing Home Office officials to have direct involvement in the making of the series.
That claim has been rejected by the show's producer Jules Seymour, who told the paper that "editorial control was always ours".
An ITV spokesman said the channel was "not aware of any compliance issues" involving the programme.
PCSOs support the work of local police forces but do not have the same powers as regular officers.
Having tenderly nursed the turtles back to health, Blue Reef Aquarium curator Matt Slater said he was "delighted".
After six months of rehabilitation at Blue Reef Aquarium, Newquay, the two loggerheads have been returned to the sea off a beach in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria.
"Seventy-five percent of the sea turtles that we receive have been hurt because of man's activities," said Pascual Calabuig, the centre's director.
"Through diagnosis, treatment, operations, protein-rich food, fluid and antibiotics, we help save 80% of the turtles that we receive," said Mr Calabuig.
Along with industrial fisheries, habitat loss and climate change are the main threats facing turtles.
It was Mr Calabuig's excellent reputation and his centre's track record that helped Blue Reef decide to choose Gran Canaria as the release site.
"We could also get cheap flights and the Canary Islands are the nearest land point to the loggerheads' migration route around the Atlantic," explained Mr Slater.
"Within 24 hours hatchlings swim into the open water of the Atlantic Ocean," explained Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager at the Marine Conservation Society.
Scientists are uncertain why loggerhead turtles have been stranding on UK and Ireland coasts in record numbers this year.
Most agree that extreme weather systems over the UK may be a cause.
Loggerhead turtles are hard-shelled and unable to raise their body temperature in order to survive in the cold UK waters.
Unable to feed, the loggerheads became lethargic and drifted inland.
Mr Richardson also suggests a rare unseasonable jellyfish bloom at the end of November off the west coast of the UK may also have contributed to an increase in strandings.
Curator Matt Slater followed Dink and James on their journey back to the wild.
James was stranded on Blackrock Beach, Bude, on 26 January this year, and Dink a week later further up the coast at Putsborough Beach, Woolacombe.
"As a result, their metabolism speeded up and they are able to heal faster," said Mr Slater.
After six months of dedicated rehabilitation, the turtles had reached peak condition and were ready for repatriation.
They flew to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, on Monday 23 June and were released on a beach two days later.
How dead turtles in the UK are investigated
Yet despite having a conviction for a horrific attack on two 14-year-old girls, Peter Tobin was able to avoid detection until he was arrested for the rape and murder of Angelika Kluk.
The church handyman was sentenced to 14 years in prison at Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire in 1994 for the assault.
After his release in December 2004, he moved to Paisley, East Renfrewshire but within 10 months the authorities had lost track of him.
The case has once again raised questions over the early release and monitoring of sex offenders.
Tobin, who is originally from Scotland, has a criminal record which appears to date back to 1965.
It has been reported that at the age of seven he was sent to a reform school.
He then spent time in a young offenders' institution and served jail terms for burglary, forgery and conspiracy.
In 1993, Tobin attacked the two 14-year-olds in his flat in Havant, Hampshire.
The court heard how he lured the girls to his home, held them captive at knifepoint and forced them to take sedatives.
He raped one of them while she was partially conscious and indecently assaulted the other.
Tobin fled to Coventry where he sought refuge among an evangelical Christian community using a false name to cover his tracks.
Unlike the Angelika Kluk case, Tobin pleaded guilty to the attack.
The judge described it as "an appalling incident, I think the worst I have ever come across".
After his release, Tobin returned to his native Scotland, to a home in Paisley.
It is believed he then attacked another girl in the flat.
In October 2005 a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to notify the police that he had changed his address but they failed to trace him.
In May 2006, Tobin was again seeking refuge through a religious organisation.
He arrived at St Patrick's Church in Anderston and took advantage of homeless group Loaves and Fishes.
Exploiting the "open doors policy", he worked as an odd job man under the false name of Pat McLaughlin.
Two days after murdering Ms Kluk, Strathclyde Police interviewed Tobin about her disappearance.
However, despite the outstanding warrant and a picture which had been widely circulated around the country's forces, they failed to make the connection.
Tobin fled to London where he was finally arrested in a hospital.
On a Polish community message board she was using to search for her sister, Ms Kluk's sister Aneta described how she felt hearing that Tobin was in the frame for the killing.
South Caernarfon Creameries, in Pwllheli, and Tomlinson's Dairies in Wrexham, have both started selling milk in the new pouch-style packaging.
The bags are 100% degradable and it is hoped they will revive the declining service of doorstep deliveries.
In Canada, 65% of all fresh milk is already sold in bags.
South Caernarfon Creameries will be selling two pint "milk bags" in whole or semi-skimmed varieties, initially through milkmen in the Pwllheli area.
They can be stored in the fridge and customers opting for the new packaging will receive a doorstep storage tray and milk jug to hold the bags.
The dairy has also received interest from local schools for their individual third-of-a-pint bag which is used with a straw.
A primary school trial of mini-milk pouches has already been carried out by the Minera-based Tomlinson's Dairy, which said feedback had been positive.
As well as supplying schools, the business plans to sell large one litre "eco-pouches" through shops and may extend the bagged milk to their doorstep delivery service.
The dairy said the new packaging resulted in a 90% reduction in landfill volume.
The 30-year-old shot a wonderful eight under par 63 to charge through a congested field and win by two shots.
Darren Clarke and Thomas Bjorn started the day six shots ahead of the Swede, but both men finished three adrift.
Argentina's Andres Romero claimed a share of second with Luke Donald and Charl Schwartzel and the only available qualifying spot for next week's Open.
Edfors launched a spectacular run of nine birdies in 14 holes to surge to the top of the leaderboard early in the final round and that's where he stayed.
Twice a winner already this season, he picked up six shots in a sizzling outward half of 30 then added three more birdies in a row before a bogey at the 17th.
Edfors, who won the TCL Classic in China in March and the British Masters at the Belfry in May, finished some two hours before Clarke and Bjorn completed the day's play.
"It was a tough wait," he told BBC Sport.
"I played well on Thursday and Friday so I knew the game was there.
Donald boosted his Ryder Cup chances with a round of 66 to finish on 11 under par for the week.
"I played a lot better and keeping a bogey off the card over the weekend means I'm not too far away," he told BBC Sport.
Clarke and Bjorn both picked up two shots early on but their challenge faded with some wayward play and they had to settle for one over par 72s and a share of fifth place.
Defending champion Tim Clark carded his third 69 of the tournament to finish alongside the overnight leaders and England's Ben Barham on 10 under par.
But Barham was denied a place at The Open by his playing partner Romero, with the little-known South American out-scoring him by a shot.
Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia warmed up nicely for the test at Hoylake next week, with a 69 and a 68 respectively to finish in a tie for ninth spot with Raphael Jacquelin.
Home hopes dwindled as David Drysdale struggled to a 75 and slipped from third place after three rounds to thirtieth spot.
Fellow Scots; Paul Lawrie, Stephen Gallacher and Colin Montgomerie all finished one better off than Drysdale on six under par for the week.
It is only the second time in 15 years that Mr Museveni has faced an electoral contest
The authorities say preparations are complete for presidential elections on Monday, which has been declared a public holiday to enable all Ugandans to take part.
Although opinion polls have shown him consistently in the lead a stiff challenge is being put up by a former friend, a retired colonel and medical doctor, Kizza Besigye.
On the eve of voting President Museveni dismissed the challenge from Dr Besigye, his principal opponent.
Mr Museveni described him as part of an old anti-progressive group who only cared about themselves and not about Uganda, and were prepared to use tribalism and violence for their own ends.
But he said this was despite his efforts and not because of him, and that time was needed for a new generation of civil servants to emerge.
Allegations of corruption have been part of the Besigye campaign, which has posed the first real challenge to Mr Museveni's leadership.
Thousands of people attended Dr Besigye's last rally in Kampala a few days ago, hearing him explain why Mr Museveni had lost his way.
Both sides have reported intimidation and violence by their opponents during the election campaign.
To win outright in Monday's polling a candidate will need more than 50% of the votes.
The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said simpler forms would help raise �330m more in tax.
It also called for HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to improve its telephone advice service and to make its website easier to navigate.
However, HMRC has already announced the introduction of simpler forms this year and is revising its website as well.
Last month the HMRC launched a shorter form for the more than nine million self-assessment taxpayers who are due to file for the 2007-08 tax year.
It was the first big change to the forms since 1997.
"HMRC has successfully encouraged millions of people to complete and send forms to us online," said an HMRC spokeswoman.
"This has been achieved through a combination of streamlined forms, more responsive online services and media marketing," she added.
Edward Leigh MP, chairman of the Public Accounts committee said there was a lot of scope for improvement in the way HMRC dealt with taxpayers.
"Too many people are unintentionally making mistakes, resulting in an estimated underpayment of tax each year of some �330 million," he said.
"The Department is falling short of industry standards in how quickly phone enquiries are picked up and dealt with.
"Too many callers are still being shunted round the system rather than directed straightaway to the staff with the right knowledge," he added.
The committee accused the HMRC of running a website that was "a bit of a maze" and said some of its leaflets were still going over the head of people who had below average literacy.
However, the MPs acknowledged that the department's performance had improved in some areas.
In 2006-07, 72% of telephone calls were answered within 20 seconds compared with 45% the year before.
Accurate and complete advice was given 95% of the time.
The star - real name Calvin Broadus - was due to co-host the MTV Australian Video Music Awards on Sunday.
The 35-year-old had his visa cancelled after recently pleading no contest to gun and drug charges in the US.
"He doesn't seem the sort of bloke we want in this country," Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews told Sydney's Macquarie Radio.
"This man has been a member of a Los Angeles gang, and is still associated with it apparently, that's been involved in murder, robberies and drug dealing in the LA area," Mr Andrews added.
Back in February, when Mr Broadus last visited Australia, immigration officials warned him then that he could face a ban if he got into anymore trouble.
The rapper now has 28 days to protest the decision.
Donald Etra, the rapper's Los Angeles-based lawyer, said he had not heard from his client about the visa cancellation and could not comment.
The decision follows a string of incidents that Mr Broadus has been involved in over the past year.
He was recently given five years probation and 800 hours of community service in the US after pleading no contest to gun and drug charges.
And last month he was forced to scrap his UK tour with fellow rapper P Diddy after authorities denied him a visa.
On a previous visit to the UK, the rapper and members of his entourage spent a night in jail after being accused of starting a fight at Heathrow Airport.
He was also held overnight by police in Sweden on suspicion of using drugs.
"They seem to want to have a presence almost everywhere in the world," says Jean-Pierre Levesque of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Mr Levesque is the world's leading police expert on biker gangs and he believes the Hells Angels - and rival gangs - are one of the fastest growing organised crime threats in the world.
In December 2003, 57 Hells Angels and their associates were arrested for gun running and murder conspiracies across the western United States.
The arrests followed an undercover police investigation that was just the latest in a string of covert operations that have exposed violence and drug dealing among US biker gangs.
In Canada, dozens of Angels have been convicted for, in effect, running the country's cocaine distribution network.
More than 60 Angels and their associates have also been convicted in Montreal following an eight-year reign of terror that resulted in at least 160 murders.
But despite these successes, the Canadian police have not stopped the organisation spreading.
The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, founded in 1948 in California, fights hard to present a much more benign image to the public and organises charity events, such as "Toys for Tots", and sells caps, badges and T-shirts to the growing biker community.
The Harley Davidson Motorcycle Company, which has just celebrated its centenary, is enjoying a boom in sales as the urban middle classes indulge their easy-rider fantasies and take to the roads at weekends.
Among this group many see the Hells Angels as heroes - freedom-loving wild men in the great tradition of the American outlaw.
But for many in the law enforcement community, the Angels are indulging in a ghastly confidence trick.
Timothy S McKinley, a former FBI special agent, remembers one incident that sums up the Hells Angels' potential for brutality.
"The Hells Angels are not organised crime in the sense of traditional organised crime.
"Traditional organised crime - such as the Italian mafia and the Japanese Yakuza - are typically organised on a pyramid structure with one boss who gives the orders flowing downwards and to whom the money flows upward.
It is a far cry from the image of the Hells Angels in Britain, where they tend to be viewed as an eccentric throwback to the 1960s and 70s.
But the Angels have also expanded steadily in the UK too and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) biker gang expert - who we cannot name for operational reasons - has little doubt that some bikers here are also involved in serious criminal activities.
And with prospective chapters in Chile, Russia and the Caribbean soon to come, the worldwide Hells Angels network is still growing.
I am afraid it is going to be a bit longer and I haven't got an autocue and I haven't got a script, I've just got a few notes so it might be a bit messy; but it will be me.
You know my favourite conference in all my years of coming wasn't that one two years ago, it was almost 20 years ago after the Berlin wall had fallen and we met in Bournemouth.
When I left school I travelled through the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc and I will never forget the dull uniformity, the greyness of life under Communism, the lack of choice, the lack of freedom, the lack of expression.
And I remember that day in Bournemouth standing at the back of the hall; hairs standing up on the back of my neck as a succession of democratically elected leaders, some of them just out of prison, walked onto that stage and praised Margaret Thatcher and our party for the inspiration she gave on our long march to freedom.
And I felt proud that day, I felt proud of our values, I felt proud of our party; proud of the part we had played in helping to forge a movement that brought freedom across our continent.
And this party, our party, has campaigned over these last two years in a way we have never done before on our National Health Service up and down the country to save our services and to praise the people who work in the NHS; I didn't do that, you did that and you should be proud of what you have done.
And that's why I am proud that I can stand here with the first Muslim woman of a Shadow Cabinet or Cabinet in Sayeeda Warsi who will be a great talent for our party and our country.
And those changes have brought us success, in local elections we have taken Plymouth, we have taken Lincoln, we took Chester, we took the council right here in Blackpool and as William reminded us in that great speech on Sunday we are back in the North of England, a force to be reckoned with in every part of our country.
And some people say that there is no such thing as friendship in politics but I can tell you that when you do this job, leading our party, there is no better friend, and there is no better friend of this party, than William Hague.
There were the GP surgery family-friendly opening hours - we've had that one three times before, eco towns - four times before, competitive sport in our schools - six times before, and no indication about how any of these things are going to be done.
And we heard from Alan Duncan how we will introduce regulatory budgets to cut that regulation and I can tell you that we will get out of the European Social Chapter so we can make those rules in Britain rather than in Brussels.
And for parents with disabled children, it means not having to fight for a special school and save your special schools it means special schools are there if you want to choose them for your children.
So we will say to churches, to voluntary bodies, to private companies, to private schools come into the state sector, find the parents and the children who have a simple regulatory regime, per capita funding and we can have those new schools so we can really drive up standards.
Ed Balls gave a speech the other day - not the one at the conference that was dreadful - he gave a speech the other day that I could have given myself about standards, about rigour, about discipline - so why isn't it happening?
I don't think they've ever got to grips with the educational establishment, some of whom still think it's wrong to say children have got something wrong, because you'll brand them as failures, who still seem to think that all must win prizes, who still seem to think we have to treat all children the same.
And I stopped a boy as he was running into his GCSE exam and I said 'What's the problem?' and he said 'Well, I got completely pissed last night, I've got a hangover and I'm going to flunk this exam'.
So George, your first task when we win the election is to set up a lifeboat fund, and give those 125,000 people the support and the money that they deserve for having been let down so badly by this government.
You remember 10 years ago being told how many young people were on the scrap heap, well that scrap heap has actually got higher, and that is a scandal in our country.
And we will ask the charities, the voluntary bodies, the private companies who have such expertise in this area to run these benefit systems for us, why do I think they are better? I think they show a greater understanding of the personal and emotional needs of people who have been stuck out of work for so long.
It has worked in other parts of the world, it can work here, it's a tough choice, it's a difficult thing to put through, but we have got to do it.
You know there is a phenomenon in Britain that's called LATs - that's Living Apart Together and there are 2m people who pretend to live apart because the benefits system pays you more to live apart than live together.
So what will we do to change that?
Well, as George has set out, we will end the couple's penalty in the benefit system, so we don't penalise couples, we will reward them and yes I believe we should recognise marriage in the tax system as well.
But I don't just want to give people a tax cut, I want to give people a time increase, time for many families is the most precious commodity of all, time you can spend at home, time to help with the home work, time you can do things in the house and that's why I think it's time not just for these benefit and tax changes I've spoken about but also to say to all employees in all companies with children that you should have the right to ask for flexible working.
Companies that have adopted this have found that they are able to grant the request in the vast majority of cases, they have actually found that productivity has gone up, profits have gone up, staff morale has gone up and keeping staff is easier.
But again why has it gone wrong?
Ten years on from a government that said "24 hours to save the NHS", billions spent and yet moral is so low, some hospitals still threatened with closure, departments shutting down, productivity so poor in the NHS, what's gone wrong? Again if we don't understand why Labour are failing we won't succeed.
So what will we do to be different?
So if this government goes ahead with the plans to say the district general hospital is over we will fight them every step of the way between now and the general election and when it comes to public services and when it comes to this new world of unease there is another issue that we have to approach and approach sensibly and it's the issue of immigration.
We have instead 15,000 nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, we have Iran trying to get hold of a nuclear weapon and threatening Israel, we have insurgency in Iraq and the possible impact on the Middle East.
We have progress in Africa yes, but countries in the east like Somalia that are failed states and narco-states in the west like Guinea Bissau and perhaps most threateningly of all, almost perhaps as many as 4,000 of our fellow citizens have been through terrorist training camps in Afghanistan or in Pakistan and many will have returned to our country.
And when Labour came forward with plans to replace Trident, I am proud of the fact that we marched our members of Parliament through those division lobbies to make sure that vote was won.
And when it comes to Iraq we all want to see more of our troops come home and if the prime minister makes the right decisions, if we can guarantee more security in southern Iraq, then we will support him when he acts in the national interest.
And our prime minister likes to say that nothing in Britain is broken but I would refer him to a piece of paper which is all about the sacrifices our troops are prepared to make on our behalf, including the ultimate sacrifice and our duties and obligations to them.
It's called the Military Covenant and Mr Brown, I believe your government has broken it.
Why can't we have free parcels all year round, not just at Christmas time? Why can't we have the same system as the Americans where your leave starts the moment you step foot on American soil rather than when you actually leave Camp Bastion in the middle of Afghanistan.
But when you are wounded on a battlefield in Helmand one day and you wake up next day in a hospital you want to recuperate with your comrades in arms and that must mean a separate military ward.
But I think that the most important change that we need to make, the most important Conservative principal we need to apply to our foreign and defence policy, is to make sure that we are realistic and not utopian.
How can we win an insurgency when there are seven different military chains of command? How can we rebuild a country when we don't have one person coordinating the aid between the EU, NATO and the UN? How can we really help a people when the country is still so awash with drugs and has so much corruption?
In those days civil servants felt that they could stand up for their integrity and tell Ministers when they got it wrong and that's what we need to happen again.
And in a Conservative Britain Hizb ut Tahrir will be banned.
It doesn't matter whether you look at the snows of Kilimanjaro, or the melting Greenland ice sheet, or the fact that closer to home the Thames barrier meant to be lifted once every six years, is now being lifted six times a year.
Some people say that there is nothing that we can do because China builds a power station every six weeks and what can we in Britain do? I think they have got it wrong.
But undoubtedly the biggest threat that people face in this country is the crime on their streets.
Well what a ridiculous way to treat the police force.
Messi helped Barcelona win three trophies last season - the Champions League, Spanish league and Spanish Cup.
He picked up 473 votes out of a possible 480, beating the 2008 winner Cristiano Ronaldo into second place.
Two other Barcelona players were in the top five and another, Inter Milan's Samuel Eto'o, was at the Spanish side last season as well.
The highest placed British player was Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney, who came eighth.
The European Footballer of the Year award is organised by a French football magazine.
Messi has already bagged nine goals this season, and is thinking about winning the trophy again in 2010.
Baxter will play his 276th match for the Chiefs when he faces Plymouth Albion, breaking the previous mark held by his brother Rob.
"I'm proud to have played so many times for Exeter so it's nice to get that record," Baxter told BBC Devon.
Sheikh Taj el-Din al-Hilali said women who did not wear a hijab (head dress) were like "uncovered meat".
But he has now apologised for any offence caused by his comments, The Australian newspaper reports.
Leading Muslim women condemned the comments and PM John Howard said the remarks were "appalling".
"The idea that women are to blame for rapes is preposterous," Mr Howard told reporters.
In a statement released on Thursday, Sheikh Hilali said he had been quoting another, unnamed, source and did not mean his words to condone rape.
"Women in our Australian society have the freedom and the right to dress as they choose.
A spokesman for Sheikh Hilali earlier said the quote had been taken out of context and referred not to sexual assault, but to sexual infidelity.
The sermon was targeted against men and women who engaged in extra-marital sex and did so through alluring types of clothes, he said.
The leader of Australia's largest Islamic organisation has threatened to ban the cleric from teaching at Lakemba Mosque in Western Sydney.
Tom Zreika, president of the Lebanese Muslim Association, which owns the mosque, said he condemned Sheikh Hilali's words.
But Mr Zreika said the LMA had yet to fully review the contents of the sermon and Sheik Hilali should be offered the benefit of the doubt until any offence had been proved.
A copy of the cleric's comments delivered in a sermon to some 500 worshippers in Sydney last month during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was initially published in The Australian.
The uncovered meat is the problem, he went on to say.
"If she was in her room, in her home, in her hijab, no problem would have occurred," he added.
Sheikh Hilali also condemned women who swayed suggestively and wore make-up, implying they attracted sexual assault.
Sheikh Hilali's critics have previously accused him of praising suicide bombers and claiming the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 were "God's work against oppressors".
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney says the cleric's latest comments are seen as particularly insensitive because Sydney was the scene six years ago of a series of gang rapes committed by a group of Lebanese Australians, who received long prison sentences.
Finance Minister Peter Costello called on Muslims to condemn the speech.
"If you have a significant religious leader like this preaching to a flock in a situation where we've had gang rapes, in a way that seems to make it justifiable, then people that listen to that kind of comment can get the wrong idea," he said.
A number of leading Muslim women have already spoken out against the sermon, describing it as repulsive and offensive.
Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward said the comments could be an incitement to crime.
She added that the cleric should be deported for inciting rape.
The first episode of the 20-hour, 10-day programming marathon gave the network more than six million viewers and talk of a follow-up series has begun.
Taken follows the stories of three families over 50 years of alien abductions.
It will be shown on BBC Two and BBC Choice in early 2003.
A young girl, Allie, played by eight-year-old Dakota Fanning, is at the centre of Taken.
She is joined by Matt Frewer, best-known for playing Max Headroom, and Heather Donahue, who starred in The Blair Witch Project.
The series is said to have cost $40m, one of the most expensive mini series in TV history, but producers hope overseas sales will recoup much of the cost.
Producer Steven Spielberg has a long association with science fiction.
He directed Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, a section of a Twilight Zone movie and two Jurassic Park movies.
As a producer he has worked on Back to the Future, Gremlins, Innerspace, Deep Impact and Men in Black.
Mercury was born Farrukh Bulsara in Zanzibar, 1946, to parents originally from Mumbai.
He went to boarding school in India, and along with his family moved to west London in 1964 where he enrolled in art college and embarked on his musical career.
The star's 87-year-old mother, Jer Bulsara, spoke to BBC Asian Network's Dil Neiyyar about her memories of her famous son.
Freddie Mercury's mother and sister talk about the memorial
Her eyes moisten and her chest fills with pride as her fingers caress the images.
"I'm so proud of him," she whispers.
The pictures are of Freddie Mercury and the woman lingering over them is his mother, Jer Bulsara.
She says that Freddie was a performer from a very early age.
"Any sort of music in the school he used to play and sometimes he used to play at the weekend because it was [near] a holiday resort.
"He knew we wanted him to be a lawyer or an accountant or something like that, because most of his cousins were.
It soon became apparent to the family that Freddie wanted a career in music, and at their humble terraced home he composed music that would later make him world famous.
"He used to write some of the songs down and tuck them under the pillow before going to college," his mother says.
But he was soon forced to choose between living with his parents and his love of music.
"I was sad when he left but he said, 'This is the only way to move forward, Mum'.
"I just told him to work hard, do his best and we were here to help him," adds Mrs Bulsara.
"But nobody bothered him, they were all very good and used to respect us and him," she says.
His mother's cooking even sustained Queen during long recording sessions which would stretch late into the night.
"When he used to go to studio for his music he loved the cheese biscuits that I used to bake," his mother says.
Eighteen years after his death, Queen and Freddie Mercury's legacy continue to go from strength to strength, with The X Factor recently paying homage to the band and their songs.
Mrs Bulsara is particularly proud that his former home town is now going to honour her son.
Under the deal, no foreign national living outside Poland will be allowed to buy land without explicit government clearance for 12 years after the country joins, widely expected in 2004.
Foreigners who already lease land in the country will however be given an option to buy within that period.
"It's a success for the government," declared Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller in Warsaw.
However, negotiators have warned that forthcoming talks on agricultural subsidies for farm-heavy Poland will prove much tougher.
Land in Poland, the largest of the 10 countries hoping for 2004 entry, is up to 30 times cheaper than in EU member states, making it attractive to outside buyers.
Poles and other east Europeans were dismayed when it was revealed that their workers may have to wait seven years before they can seek jobs in western Europe, after Germany and Austria said they feared an influx of cheap foreign labour.
But it is proposals to delay full farming aid to new members for a decade which have caused real outrage in Poland, where 20% of the population is employed in agriculture.
Many argue that eastern European farmers will find it impossible to compete with the heavily subsidised produce of their western counterparts.
Chief Polish negotiator Jan Truszcynski said while he was pleased with Thursday's result, the hard part lay ahead.
"There is some difference between what we see as a useful, equitable deal on agriculture and what is proposed as a starting point for negotiations by the European Commission," he said.
The society says it knows of at least 16 deaths on British roads in which mobiles were implicated.
It wants the UK to follow the lead of the US state of New York where from December drivers will face being fined for driving and talking on a hand-held mobile at the same time.
Some 37 other states have also taken up the idea, but as yet none has passed it.
The RoSPA campaign is backed by the family of 11-year-old Rebekka Hudd, who died after she was hit by a car driven by a man using a phone.
Rebekka, from Pucklechurch, near Bristol, died after she was hit by a four-wheel drive vehicle near her home in 1996.
David Powell, then 42 and from Bristol, was fined �250 and given six penalty points after he admitted careless driving in relation to Rebekka's death.
RoSPA has written to Road Safety Minister David Jamieson calling for the change in the law.
The telecoms industry has persistently lobbied against restrictions arguing that there was no conclusive proof that using mobile phones will driving causes accidents.
But RoSPA's head of road safety Kevin Clinton said research showed that using a mobile phone - whether hand-held or hands-free - made drivers more likely to have an accident.
RoSPA's argument is that people's concentration is distracted when they are talking on a mobile, making them potentially hazardous on the road.
Simon Rockman, from What Mobile magazine, said he supported a ban on hands-held mobiles when driving, but not on hands-free sets.
Last year Paul Browning, 36, from Kenley, Surrey, was composing a text message on his mobile phone when he veered off a road and fatally injured a pedestrian.
Paul Hammond, 24, from Hockley, Essex, was killed after being hit by Browning's heavy goods vehicle, laden with gas bottles, in a lay-by on the A13 at Pitsea, Essex.
Nick Hewer, from the Apprentice, helps debate competition with some harsh words for Labour leadership contender Ed Miliband, plus Andrew Neil and Michael Portillo.
Others, too, talk up - or play down - the notion that all the stories swirling round the prime minister's wife have opened cracks between the Blairs and their media advisers.
The Mirror talks of "the lies that could topple Labour"; the Mail of "a scandal that speaks to New Labour's culture of mendacity, which is corroding trust in public life and government".
It's the details of Mrs Blair's lifestyle advice that many of the papers just can't resist.
That Mrs Blair is a top lawyer adds to the fun.
The incredulous tone is caught by Tony Parsons of the Mirror.
"At a rebirthing ceremony in Mexico," he writes, "Mr and Mrs Blair entered a brick-built pyramid in their swimming costumes, prayed to the four winds, smeared their bodies with mud, papaya and watermelon and were encouraged to cry out loud.
There are reminders of other realities too.
The Star says the government will buy 5,000 body bags and 220,000 decontamination suits.
Stuff and nonsense, muttered through gritted teeth, is the general reaction to last night's Turner prize competition.
The Guardian accepts that Tyson's work made people "laugh and scratch their heads".
But its critic finds the images and objects "incomprehensible".
Sharing the mood of bafflement at modern art, the Mail has decided to set up an art competition of its own.
The paper is offering a �20,000 prize for the best figurative painting - what it calls "real art".
And, in the meantime, it prints a gallery of images for its readers to enjoy - half are genuine artworks, while the others are just silly pictures.
A statement issued by US President George Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, said acceptance of the governments' blueprint would "promote the reconciliation that thepeople of Northern Ireland desire and deserve".
The statement came as Mr Bush prepared to leave the province following his overnight stay on Monday, during which he held a war summit with Mr Blair at Hillsborough Castle.
Mr Ahern joined the two leaders on Tuesday for a working lunch with the pro-Agreement parties to discuss the stalled Northern Ireland political process.
Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration was suspended on 14 October 2002 amid allegations of IRA intelligence gathering at the heart of the Stormont government.
"They reflect our shared view that there can be no place in Northern Ireland for paramilitary activity and capability.
Mr Blair and Mr Ahern aer expected to return on Thursday - the fifth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement - to unveil proposals to break the impasse.
Speaking earlier on Tuesday, President Bush said he would be urging Northern Ireland politicians to "seize the opportunity for peace" during a crucial week for the province's political process.
Speaking before meeting President Bush, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said that "no deal has been done".
Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble described Mr Bush's words as positive and supportive.
He said the president had given a strong signal to republicans that time was running out.
The village of Hillsborough in County Down has been virtually sealed off amid intense security for Mr Bush's two-day visit.
There were protests outside Hillsborough Castle, with some demonstrators moved off the road by police.
Fourteen people were arrested after riot police broke up an anti-war demonstration outside Belfast City Hall.
Five police officers sustained minor injuries.
Those detained were among a group of more than 50 protestors who staged a sit-down on the road following what had been a more peaceful trade union organised rally at lunchtime.
Police moved in after appeals for the demonstrators to disperse were ignored.
Meanwhile, anti-Agreement Democratic Unionist MP Gregory Campbell said their voters were being discriminated against because the party had not been invited to the talks.
The party was offered a meeting with Ambassador Richard Haass, the US special envoy to Northern Ireland, but declined it.
Last month, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern held talks in the province, but failed to reach agreement with the pro-Agreement parties on a number of key issues.
Unionists insist on sanctions against parties who break the terms of the Agreement, however Sinn Fein object to the measures which they say are aimed solely at them.
Other controversial proposals by the governments to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly include allowing "on-the-run" paramilitaries to be dealt with through a judicial commission.
With an IRA statement expected some time after the joint statement by theBritish and Irish premiers, Mr Trimble is demanding that disarmament has to be both visible and transparent.
Two drums owned by Geraldine Keita tested positive for anthrax, a hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told.
Christopher "Pascal" Norris, 50, died in 2006 after attending a drumming workshop and class in the Borders.
Mrs Keita claimed her workshop had been made a "scapegoat" as only its drums had been tested for anthrax.
Mr Norris, of Stobs near Hawick, died a few days after attending a drumming workshop in Kelso and a class in nearby Smailholm.
The inquiry heard that a dun dun and a djembe drum owned by Mrs Keita tested positive for anthrax.
The dun dun was used at a workshop in Kelso which Mr Norris attended on the Sunday before he died.
Asked whether Mr Norris played the instrument himself, Mrs Keita said she could not remember, as he had his own drum with him that day.
He also attended a drumming class in Smailholm on Tuesday, 4 July 2006.
Mrs Keita told the inquiry that she had imported a number of drums from the Republic of Guinea, a country she visited in 2004 to study drumming.
While there she met drumming teacher Nansady Keita, who she later married.
Mr Keita arranged for drums to be flown to her in the UK.
Mrs Keita, 34, said that she asked Scottish Enterprise for advice on importing as she planned to set up a business.
"In terms of importing did it ever occur to you?"
After Mr Norris's death health officials contacted her, said they needed to take samples of the drums and told her to stop classes immediately.
Initially they were given the all-clear, but she was later told that there were problems with two of the drums.
Mrs Keita said that there were 20 to 30 drummers at the Kelso workshop, many with their own drums.
She questioned why none of these had been tested.
"It seems we were a bit of a scapegoat really.
She suggested that the anthrax spores could have ended up on her drums through cross-contamination at the workshop.
The inquiry also heard from her husband, who was asked if he had ever heard of anyone becoming ill and dying after playing the drums.
Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis.
It most commonly occurs in animals such as cattle, sheep and goats, but can also occur in humans when they are exposed to infected animals.
The aim is to get people fit, and make swimming lessons more fun.
But it can only be done with special equipment and a fully-trained instructor.
Swimming pools across the UK are trying it out, so the new sport might come to one near you.

After Speaker John Bercow granted an urgent question on the Beecroft report in the Commons on 21 May 2012, Labour's Chuka Umunna put forward the latter view.
Having commissioned the report, ministers now intend to "water down people's fundamental rights at work", Mr Umunna suggested.
He concluded that they had "lost the plot", since "people in fear of losing their jobs" would be less likely to boost demand in the British economy by spending their earnings on goods and services.
Ministers were set to release the full report later this week, but a draft report was leaked to the press.
It reportedly included measures to make it easier for companies to sack under-performing workers, although Business Secretary Vince Cable has since repudiated its advocacy of moving towards "no-fault dismissal" as "the wrong approach".
Mr Umunna said the government's handling of the review had been "a complete and utter shambles".
Responding on behalf of the government, Business Minister Mark Prisk revealed that the publication date would be brought forward because of the leaked draft.
He told MPs that the government was planning to take action on 17 of the report's 23 proposals.
These would "ensure they maximise flexibility and reflect modern workplace practices", he said, and "strengthen our international competitiveness in difficult economic times".
"This government is taking positive action to reform the labour market and ensure we can help more people get back into work as soon as possible," Mr Prisk argued.
But he told MPs that extra consultation was needed on the no-fault dismissal proposal.
Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti says he cannot guarantee Joe Cole will play regular first-team football, but insists he wants the midfielder, who is out of contract at the end of the season, to stay at Stamford Bridge.
A British mountaineer is preparing to honour an Olympic pledge by climbing Mount Everest, taking with him a gold medal awarded to a member of the British Everest Expedition in 1922.
Although the expedition narrowly failed to reach the summit, they were awarded the medal for mountaineering by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founding father of the modern Olympic Games.
The team then pledged to finally complete their expedition and take one of the medals to the summit, which they were never able to fulfil.
The issue could not be more topical than in the Italian capital, Rome, where no less a person than the prime minister has immersed himself in the debate.
In language as colourful as some of the sprayed daubings, Silvio Berlusconi described Italy's capital as "dirty" and "disfigured" by the graffiti.
Admittedly, Mr Berlusconi was making as much a political point as an aesthetic one, blaming the left for the sorry state of some of Rome's walls.
But there are many people living here, or visiting this ancient city, who would agree.
"I hate it," said Reuben McQueen, a shop owner in the central historical area.
"Look what they've just done," said Mr McQueen, pointing to freshly sprayed graffiti on the window of his shoe-shop.
Anne, an Australian tourist, was also upset to see the myriad lines, designs and general grime associated with the graffiti.
One estimate suggests there may be as many as 3,500 graffiti artists working in Rome - about 1,000 of them being so-called taggers who spray public buildings and walls.
The ancient city centre, which is a Unesco World Heritage Site, is home to some of the most stunning monuments and architecture to be found anywhere in the world.
From the Trevi Fountain to the Coliseum, from the Pantheon to Bernini's Four Rivers creation in Piazza Navona, it has a rich fabric of history that many believe is gradually being unpicked by the sprayers.
Giovanni Fiscon, the man in charge of a graffiti clean-up operation on the city's streets, said he had a squad of 16 people working in shifts 24 hours a day.
The city has a longer-term solution underway.
It has set aside some six miles (10km) of walls for the graffiti artists to use.
Paolo, whom I met spraying paint on one of the designated walls, said he had been a graffiti artist for 14 years.
Paolo explained that with tagging, you have to rush because the police or someone else could come along at any time.
The general standard of artwork had declined since his early days, Paolo said.
He added that much of it was pure vandalism and that is what had turned people off graffiti, because they were not seeing the best of it.
I asked him what he thought of these "official" graffiti walls.
"They're fine, though there is not the same adrenalin rush you get when you are doing it on real buildings and walls," he said.
When you cast your eye along the authorised walls being used by Paolo and his colleagues, you can see why some graffiti has now transferred from the street to art galleries.
But not everyone is convinced.
Franco Ferrarotti, a sociologist who has studied the urban existence of young people, is not impressed by the defacing of Rome.
One famous book on the subject of graffiti is entitled Vandals and Crusaders.
It depicts the street sprayers as modern artists whose work needs to be appreciated as much as conventional imagery committed to canvas.
But is it mainstream, or merely a maintenance headache?
The best graffiti sells for thousands of dollars; the rest, like those on many Roman walls, seems alien in such beautiful surroundings.
Italy gave the world the word "graffiti", but it does not always like to be reminded what that can mean.
The appetite for risk among chief financial officers (CFOs) is at its highest since the beginning of 2008, financial services firm Deloitte said.
Almost four in five of the 128 CFOs surveyed thought the UK banking system could sustain a recovery.
However, 48% said the economy was their biggest concern in 2010 as they expect any recovery to be weak.
Of the CFOs that participated in Deloitte's quarterly survey, 39 were from FTSE 100 companies and 47 from FTSE 250 companies.
The UK has been in recession for a record six consecutive quarters but is expected to have returned to growth in the final three months of 2009.
Many finance chiefs were planning expansionary strategies this year, he added.
Persistent file-sharers could have their internet accounts suspended in an attempt to crack down on piracy.
The FAC said "heavy-handed" tactics may turn fans away from music for good.
The FAC, a pressure group formed to represent performers, has joined forces with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors and the Music Producers Guild.
In a joint statement, the three bodies of music-makers said they "vehemently oppose" the plans to punish file-sharers.
That is in contrast to major record labels and many other commercial arms of the music industry, who have welcomed the suggestions.
Blur drummer Dave Rowntree said the FAC was against file-sharing, but that previous attempts at legal action had turned fans against the music industry and the artists themselves.
It would be very difficult to find out who was swapping files and whether those files contained copyrighted recordings, he warned.
Singer and fellow FAC board member Billy Bragg described the measures as a "very heavy sledgehammer".
"We're concerned that, in an age where there is much greater competition for attention, these proposals are in danger of driving young people away from the idea of listening to music," he said.
Many young fans had discovered his music through file-sharing, Bragg said, and paid for his music in other ways, such as buying gig tickets.
Phonographic Performance Limited, which licenses recorded music and music videos for public performance and broadcast said the majority of its 40,000 members were "not household names" and "they deserve to be protected from theft".
His sentiment was echoed by the Creative Coalition Campaign - a partnership between trade unions representing people working in the creative industries.
"Our creative sector produces world-class content, bringing joy to countless people across the UK and the world, but this can't be sustained if illegal file-sharing persists," said a statement from the coalition.
Geoff Taylor, of the British Phonographic Industry, which represents record labels, says the government is right to consider "temporary suspension as a last resort, where accounts are repeatedly used illegally despite warnings".
"Most people across the music sector recognise the serious damage that illegal file-sharing is doing to investment in new music," he added.
But Patrick Rackow, chief executive of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, said sanctions would upset fans, rather than driving them towards legal services.
In its Digital Britain report, originally published in June, the government set a target to reduce file-sharing by 70% in the first year.
That report gave media regulator Ofcom until 2012 to consider whether "technical measures" - such as reducing broadband speeds or blocking access to download sites - were necessary.
However, according to a statement from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) released last month, that time-frame is now considered "too long to wait".
Speaking in response to the FAC's concerns, Mr Timm subsequently added that "any action would follow a clear series of warnings and there would be a fair and effective appeals process".
UK Music, an umbrella body representing the British music industry, said it was "pleased that government is proposing accelerated and proportionate action to meet their stated ambition of reducing illegal file-sharing".
"Throughout this debate, UK Music has voiced concerns that the original time-frame of proposed legislation, and particularly the trigger mechanisms that would grant Ofcom reserve powers to implement technical measures, would have failed to meet these ambitions," a statement said.
In a letter to The Times newspaper, Michael Wilks said the examination had been carried out in a "forensic capacity" and should therefore be "disclosable in any judicial procedures".
Following the 5 January medical examination, Mr Straw said he was "minded" to release the 84-year-old general, who remained under house arrest in Britain pending extradition to Spain on torture charges.
The examination, carried out by four doctors at a London hospital, had concluded the general was medically unfit to stand trial.
But Mr Straw refused to release details of the examination on the grounds of patient-doctor confidentiality.
Human rights organisations, the authorities in France and Belgium and the Spanish judge who wants to see General Pinochet stand trial, have all criticised the secrecy.
Mr Straw, who is expected to make his final decision within days, is sticking to his decision not to release the report.
A Chilean air force plane is waiting on a runway in Bermuda, waiting for the call to fetch General Pinochet from the UK if he is released.
On Thursday the Spanish Government blocked an attempt by JudgeBaltasar Garzon to file an immediate appeal if the general is freed, saying it did not want to harm relations with Chile.
Chile has said General Pinochet could still face trial if he returns home.
The general, who headed Chile's military government between 1973 and 1990, is facing more than 50 lawsuits but could be entitled to immunity as a lifelong senator.
Thousands of people have attended a series of rallies across Northern Ireland to show their anger at the murders of two soldiers and a policeman.
Silent protests took place in Lisburn, Downpatrick, Londonderry and Belfast.
A silent vigil was also held in Newry with people united in protest.
Several thousand people stood in sombre silence at the front of Belfast City Hall, the biggest of the rallies.
Two soldiers and a policeman were killed in the space of three days.
Dissident republican groups the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA claimed responsibility for the murders.
A cross-party group of MPs held a silent vigil in support of the peace rallies outside the Houses of Parliament.
As the rallies took place, the body of Constable Stephen Carroll, who was shot dead in Lurgan on Monday,was brought to his family home in Banbridge.
On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered for a vigil near the scene where Constable Carroll was shot.
People gathered at the vigil said prayers for the dead man's family.
Francis Climbie has travelled from his home in the Ivory Coast to attend the public inquiry into his daughter's killing.
He sobbed as he saw the photograph of her missing a tooth with her face badly bruised.
Victoria, eight, had 128 separate injuries on her body when she died in Tottenham, north London, in February last year.
Victoria's parents had allowed Kouao to take her to Europe in 1998 in the belief she would receive a better education.
The hearing was adjourned temporarily so that Mr Climbie could compose himself.
Mr Climbie said he had started to become worried when he received pictures showing a thin-looking Victoria.
Mr Climbie said that he was so worried that he wanted to get in touch with Kouao but he did not have an address for her in England or the money to make a international telephone call.
Earlier he had spoken of how excited Victoria and the family had been when she was given the opportunity by her great-aunt in October 1998 to travel to Europe for the chance of a better education.
On Friday Mr Climbie told the inquiry he had trusted Kouao.
"The way she looks and spoke proved in mymind that she was honest and genuine," he said.
Victoria's mother Berthe said that although she had met Kouao on just three previous occasions - all family funerals, she had seemed trustworthy.
The 41-year-old added that Kouao had given her money so that Victoria could have her hair braided and decorated before the trip.
Kouao had subsequently told the family that Victoria was doing well in France and had ajob at an airport, Mrs Climbie said.
The inquiry has heard how Victoria was starved, beaten with coat hangers, bicycle chains, bound naked and made to sleep in a bath in a freezing bathroom.
On Wednesday, Neil Garnham QC, counsel to the inquiry, said she had been put in a black plastic sack and forced to lie in her own excrement and urine.
It is thought that Germany had objected to the use of the name Typhoon, which was to have been officially announced at a news conference in London last March.
The conference was cancelled at the last minute.
Typhoon will only be used for the export market for the aircraft, which is being produced by Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy.
The partner countries will continue to use the name Eurofighter within Europe.
The name was officially announced at British Aerospace's headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire, shortly before the aircraft put on a flying display.
Partner countries foresee a global market during the next three decades of more than 800 combat aircraft, worth �70bn.
They are aiming to capture around 50% of the market for fighter jets.
"The combination of Typhoon's outstanding multi-role capabilities, with its low acquisition and through-life costs make it a very attractive option for airforces worldwide.
Almost 200 British companies, led by British Aerospace, are involved in the development of Eurofighter.
It will be assembled at BAe's site in Lancashire from components manufactured by companies in the four-partner nations.
Eurofighter is equipped for worldwide operations.
The original Typhoon was a WWII ground attack fighter.
It destroyed German tanks and artillery, playing a big part in the D-Day landings in 1944.
The Scot eventually finished more than 25 minutes behind Hiroshi Masuoka, who almost doubled his lead after taking victory in the 701km seventh stage.
Masuoka is now 11 minutes and 42 seconds ahead of team-mate Stephane Peterhansel with McRae in third more than 40 minutes in arrears.
Cyril Despres took the overall lead in the 17-day race's motorcycle category.
Masuoka finished the stage, between Tan Tan in Morocco and Atar in Mauritania, in a time of five hours 58 minutes and 35 seconds.
He had a worrying incident on the way when just after the rally crossed into Mauritania, competitors were held up by soldiers who asked for money to allow them to pass through the country.
"A soldier pointed a gun at me," said Masuoka.
McRae came home in fifth but lost valuable time after hitting trouble 456km into the day across the Oumaghawaba Erg.
The Scot's fellow former World Rally champion Miki Biasion is out of contention after failing to take the start line in the morning due to mechanical trouble.
The Spaniard went down after the first checkpoint and dropped out of the top 10 as a result.
France's Richard Sainct, the reigning champion and athree-time Dakar winner, won the stage despite struggling with an arm injury.
Despres came home in third, a result that saw him climb to the top of the standings three minutes ahead of Nani Roma.
Thursday's 393-km eighth stage is from Atar to Tidjikja.
A few days ago I visited P Ramlee's old house in Kuala Lumpur.
Unless you are from this part of the world you probably will not have heard of him.
But in Malaysia, more than 30 years after his death, he is still an icon.
But when I visited I was alone, apart from an attendant who seemed to be hiding under his counter.
So I wandered around looking at photos from P Ramlee's films and listening to his wonderful singing voice.
One of the reasons I look forward to the holidays here is because the local TV stations always screen a good selection of his movies.
My favourite is the comedy Madu Tiga - or Three Honies - made in 1964.
P Ramlee plays a married man who decides to take a second and then a third bride, all with the collusion of his first wife's mischievous father.
But despite his best efforts to keep the three from finding out about one another, inevitably they meet, become friends and finally gang up on him.
It is a cautionary tale.
But what is most striking about P Ramlee's films from the 1950s and 1960s is their depiction of Malay life.
One can still catch glimpses of a Malaysia P Ramlee would have recognised, in backwaters like the east coast state of Kelantan.
"I can't speak well," he told me, when he came out onto the porch of his little wooden house to greet me and he tapped his chest.
"I've been ill," he said.
He was not up to giving a demonstration but half-heartedly pulled out a couple of puppets from a box to show me.
Elsewhere in Kelantan I met up with Nik Rashidee, the custodian of an astonishing collection of Malay woodcarvings assembled by his late brother Nik Rashidin, the greatest carver of his age.
They were not even exhibited in Malaysia until they had already been shown at the British Museum.
It took the endorsement of a foreign institution before locals even started to wake up to their beauty.
All these crafts are being destined to oblivion, not just by conservative Muslims who dress in the Arabic style and frown on their own culture, but also by Malaysia's rapid modernisation.
Malay people seem to love the new and shiny, not the old.
At the same time they have been consumed by a wave of Islamicisation that swept across the world from the 1970s, a wave ridden by Malay politicians who after the Iranian revolution decided it was that, or be drowned by it.
"Now we understand what it is to be proper Muslims," people tell me, and in this rapidly developing country many have found in their faith a still centre in a whirlwind of change.
But it is not just traditional arts that are under pressure.
Looking at posters from P Ramlee's movies, I realise that films like these could not be made today.
"All we can do these days is tut tut at one another," a Malay friend tells me.
Across the country one sees the evidence of a culture of disapproval.
Young Malay women wear headscarves drawn tight around their faces; something their grandmothers never did.
Nightclubs are raided by the religious police, couples are prosecuted for holding hands and Muslims are sentenced to be whipped for drinking beer.
The federal government seems unsure how to respond.
And jokes about gin are just not seen as funny.
But the saddest encounter I had in Kelantan was with a criminal lawyer.
"What keeps you busy?" I asked.
Incest, drugs and rape afflict the Malay community far worse than Malaysia's large Chinese and Indian minorities.
There is a sense that the Malays are a people increasingly adrift, and as at ill at ease with themselves now, as their grandparents' generation appeared content.
It would have broken P Ramlee's heart.

Just a $4 cab ride from the White House, the centre of the most powerful nation in history, is the Shaw district, a poverty-stricken Black neighbourhood.
And while the country may be split on President Bill Clinton's behaviour, Black America stands solidly behind the president and the Democratic Party.
The Reverend Barry Hargrove is a minister at the imposing red brick Shiloh Baptist Church in Shaw.
Rev Hargrove's congregation solidly supports President Bill Clinton and his Democratic Party.
"I'm a Republican, but I'm supporting the Democratic position because it is seeking human needs over corporate greed.
"I think that Republicans have really put private interests above the needs of the people of this country, and this is dangerous," he said.
Maninder Pal Singh Kohli's name was given to detectives by James Dennis, a supervisor at a Southampton delivery firm, Winchester Crown Court heard.
Mr Kohli, 40, denies kidnap, false imprisonment, rape and murder.
Hannah, a 17-year-old A-level student, had been walking a short distance from a bus stop to her home in the Portswood area of the city when she vanished.
Mr Kohli was working as a sandwich delivery driver for Hazelwood Foods in Southampton when Hannah disappeared, the court was told on Friday.
David Slater, the company's depot manager at the time, told the court his son-in-law, James Dennis, had lent Mr Kohli about �15,000.
Mr Dennis also worked at Hazelwood Foods, as a supervisor.
The court had already heard on Thursday that Mr Dennis gave Mr Kohli's name to police after an appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch TV programme into Hannah's death.
He said Mr Dennis had continued to give money to Mr Kohli despite pressure on him to get the money back.
Mr Kohli reported for work the morning after Hannah disappeared, the court was also told.
He was seen on CCTV footage in Portsmouth, dated 15 March 2003, before he finished work early - complaining to his boss of a bad back, the court heard.
Dubai International Capital (DIC), the investment arm of Dubai's government, confirmed on Monday that they were in talks about a possible buy-out.
"I have talked to the chairman (David Moores) and chief executive (Rick Parry) about this and I was pleased with what I heard," said Benitez.
Liverpool, five-times European champions, have given DIC permission to carry out a complete study of the club's financial records ahead of a possible takeover bid.
The proposed deal is expected to include �200m to build a new 60,000-capacity stadium.
"This is the latest step on the road of finding the long-term investment that the club needs," said Parry.
"This is very important in terms of the proposed new stadium, which is key to plans for the regeneration of the local community.
Both Moores and Parry stayed behind in Liverpool while the team flew to Istanbul for Tuesday's Champions League match against Galatasaray.
However, the deal is not expected to be concluded until early next year.
DIC owns the Madame Tussauds Group and the Travelodge hotel chain as well as one third of the London Eye.
The company is an investment arm of Dubai Holding, which is owned by Dubai Crown Prince and United Arab Emirates Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Sheikh Mohammed, whose family is internationally renowned for its running of the Godolphin horse racing stables, is the world's fifth richest man, with an estimated personal wealth of $10 billion.
"Already they (DIC) have demonstrated a full understanding of, and respect for, the club's heritage and values," added Parry.
"This is very important in terms of the proposed new stadium, which is key to plans for the regeneration of the local community.
Liverpool have been linked with other takeover bids in recent years.
In 2005, American billionaire Robert Kraft - owner of the New England Patriots NFL team - was linked with a bid for the club.
Thaksin Shinawatra, then Prime Minister of Thailand, also made a high-profile bid to take control of the club in 2004.
Recent suitors have included George Gillet, the owner of the Montreal Canadians ice hockey team who met with Moores and Parry in the United States last month.
The takeover news will concern those worried about the number of Premiership clubs currently in the hands of foreign owners.
Manchester United, Chelsea, Portsmouth and Aston Villa have all gone through high-profile takeovers by foreign owners in recent years.
Joe Biden has described the current administration's foreign policy as an "abysmal failure" and pledged to " hold Russia accountable for its actions".
Yet she was, and is, driven as strongly as a parent who feels that a child may have died unnecessarily.
Her efforts, and those of a small number of other parents, led first to a GMC hearing against the Bristol surgeons, and then to a publicly-held inquiry.
Maria lives just a few streets away from the hospital where Jacinta was born.
Almost immediately, she spotted that her fingers were blue grey - the key sign that not enough oxygen-rich blood is being pumped around the body.
Later that day, it was confirmed that the baby had a combination of defects which were at the time inoperable.
"I knew that Jacinta's heart was not viable with life," she says.
What struck her about Bristol was not so much incompetence as appalling communication, in both the way the terrible news was passed on to her, and the manner in which doctors decided what treatments could be attempted.
However, in the event, this was not to be, and she began to go downhill rapidly over the winter months.
The post-mortem revealed that Jacinta's heart had failed, swelling to three times its normal size.
At this point, Maria had no idea that paediatric heart surgery at Bristol could be a problem, although she had been distressed by the communication failures covering Jacinta's care.
However, early in 1995, a friend drew her attention to press reports of the approaching storm at Bristol.
Then she saw the first television interviews with Dr Stephen Bolsin, who blew the whistle on Bristol.
She went to see Dr Bolsin, then based on the conversation, and another with Professor Gianni Angelini, an expert in adult surgery at the infirmary, started a letter-writing campaign, which grew into the foundation of the Bristol Heart Babies Action Group, as more and more parents came forward with their doubts and fears.
The pressure exerted by this group was the catalyst for much of the action taken by ministers once the affair came to light.
What still outrages her is the fact that the problems at Bristol were common knowledge among many of the medical fraternity in the Bristol area - but no-one told the families.
"Those of us who weren't in the know just handed over our children," she says.
Her project now is to build a link between doctors and their parents - and encourage a greater level of communication, and transparency between the two.
Her group, Constructive Dialogue for Clinical Accountability, has already held informal meetings, and formal debates involving doctors, statisticians and ordinary members of the public.
"All doctors are capable of making mistakes - all doctors are human.
Many parents will be unable to draw a line under events at Bristol, even after the inquiry is done and dusted.
Certainly for her the campaigning will continue long after the report - and perhaps even Bristol - have disappeared into history.
Music downloads, mobile payments and instant messaging may be common place in the developed world but in Kenya, the uptake of smartphones has been slower, particularly with many living on low incomes.
Spencer Kelly reports on how Kenyan entrepreneurs are convincing the tech goliaths like Facebook, Google and Microsoft to jump over the Atlantic and help grow their user base on even the simplest of phones - known as "dumb phones".
There is wide agreement that to mitigate climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to 50% of 2005 levels by 2050, with industrialised countries cutting their emissions by 80%.
In order to achieve this goal, large increases in both energy efficiency and renewable energy will be required.
Biofuel alternatives to petroleum are getting much attention for both ground and air transportation.
Combustion of fuels made from biomass (plant matter) recycles carbon dioxide extracted during photosynthesis back to the atmosphere, making the fuels nearly "carbon-neutral" if only modest amounts of fossil fuel are used to produce them.
However, many biofuel options will be greatly constrained by resource scarcity and cost.
Using food biomass, such as rape, corn or soybeans, creates food/fuel conflicts.
Opening up land to compensate for the reduced food output leads to large greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during land clearing and tilling that offset reductions achieved in subsequent cropping.
Oil-producing crops, such as jatropha and camelina, can be grown on non-agricultural land but factors such as land availability and rainfall limit how much can actually be produced.
Approaches using algae are attracting interest but costs are very high, and - as for camelina and jatropha - half or more of the harvested biomass ends up in by-products.
In selecting bio-based transport fuels, two criteria stand out.
First, technologies are needed that maximise liquid fuel production and carbon mitigation from scarce biomass supplies.
Second, bio-derived products must be fully compatible with petroleum fuels.
That's particularly true for aircraft applications, because of the international nature of the aviation industry and because petroleum fuels will be widely used for decades.
Our NetJets-sponsored research at Princeton University is seeking to identify technologies for displacing petroleum and reducing GHG emissions from transportation, both air and ground.
Our analyses show that the most promising options involve borrowing technologies that are already used with coal, along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that is being developed to enable continuing fossil fuel use under a carbon policy constraint.
Superclean "synfuels", otherwise known as synthetic fuels, can be made from coal via commercial processes that begin with gasification.
But the GHG emission rate for production and use of these fuels is about double that of petroleum fuels.
However, about half of the carbon is released at the plant as a stream of undiluted CO2, so CCS can be pursued at relatively low cost, reducing emissions to about the level of petroleum fuels - a lot better, but not nearly good enough for a carbon-constrained world.
What if synfuels were made from biomass via gasification?
One advantage is that all biomaterials (not just speciality crops) can be processed, which increases the effectiveness of using scarce biomass resources.
As for some other biofuels, the overall process of making and burning the liquid fuels would be nearly "carbon neutral".
However, under a carbon policy it would often be worthwhile to include CCS, making the overall GHG emission rate strongly negative - thereby greatly enhancing the carbon mitigation potential of scarce biomass supplies.
Such biofuels are not competitive with crude oil-derived products today but are likely to be very competitive at carbon prices that may be typical in 20 years' time.
An option that can be pursued now involves co-processing biomass with coal in similar gasification plants with CCS.
Co-processing about 40% biomass and 60% coal provides liquid fuels with a net-zero GHG emissions rate.
Moreover, the amount of liquid fuel produced per unit of biomass is twice as much or more than most other biomass options.
Our analysis suggests that fuels from such systems will be competitive with crude oil-derived products, even with zero pricing on GHG emissions, when the crude oil price is $100 per barrel - a figure that is expected to be typical once the global economy recovers.
The technology is ready to be deployed now in plants that co-process about 10% biomass and inject the captured CO2 into mature oil fields to coax out more crude oil.
The world's first synthetic fuel plant with CCS - the US Dakota Gasification Project that produces synthetic natural gas (not liquid fuels) from coal - has been capturing a million tonnes of CO2 annually since 2000 and transporting it 300km by pipeline into Canada, where it is used for enhanced oil recovery.
Careful monitoring has shown that after repeated re-injection, the CO2 ultimately remains stored underground.
Our research has identified a credible bio-based liquid fuel supply strategy for solving the carbon problem for transportation, even with limited biomass supplies and without abandoning crude oil.
The key concepts are gasification-based liquid fuels and CCS for both biomass and coal.
Coal/biomass-to-liquids technologies would be deployed first in coal-rich countries, to be followed by biomass-to-liquids technologies in coal-poor but biomass-rich regions.
Researchers based their findings on national curriculum test results (Sats) and IQ tests of over 10,000 children.
The study found the gap between left and right-handed pupils did not lessen with age - the gap was still evident in Key Stage 3 tests sat at 14 years.
The study also identified slow development in "mixed-handed" pupils, where neither hand is dominant.
This phenomenon was found to be a particular problem in girls.
"Our results suggest that schools could use mixed-handedness as a marker for children who are likely to need greater intervention," the report said.
The researchers wanted to establish whether being left-handed was associated with differential cognitive development.
Using data from Bristol University which tracked children born in the 1990s, the researchers examined pupils' performance in an IQ test and in Key Stage 1, 2 and 3 tests, taken at age seven, 11 and 14 respectively.
The researchers say the results mean they can rule out other factors that might have caused a gap in cognitive development, such as a poorer home background, family size and birth weight.
I know that a lot of people were afraid it might be a black Pope because they believe the popular myth that a black Pope would mean that the end of the world was coming.
In a televised speech at the opening of Parliament in Cape Town, President FW de Klerk announced restrictions would be lifted on the ANC, the smaller Pan Africanist Congress and the South African Communist Party, which is allied to the ANC.
He also made his first public commitment to release jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela, but he did not specify a date.
The reforms will allow active opposition to apartheid for the first time in 40 years of National Party rule.
Many observers were surprised by the scope of the reforms - which included a return to press freedom and suspension of the death penalty - signalling a partial end to the 25-year-old state of emergency.
Mr Mandela's wife, Winnie, remained sceptical.
Other critics complained about the government's failure to completely lift the state of emergency, as the ban on TV and photographic coverage of unrest continues.
Mr de Klerk explained this was precautionary so that the authorities could monitor the progress of the reforms.
The Conservative opposition has demanded a referendum on the white reaction to the new measures.
World leaders praised Mr de Klerk.
US President George Bush said he welcomed the decision to dismantle apartheid but emphasised further action would be needed before economic sanctions could be lifted.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has written to Mr de Klerk to congratulate him for his courage.
President FW de Klerk lifted the remaining apartheid legislation in 1991.
The ANC became South Africa's first democratically elected government in April 1994.
Nelson Mandela became the country's first black president on 10 May 1994 aged 75.

Age knows no bounds for Maldini, probably the greatest left-sided defender of his generation.
The World Cup in South Korea and Japan will be the 34-year-old's fourth.
Maldini, who has stayed loyal to Milan throughout his career, is past his prime and has understandably lost some of the pace which previously characterised his forages down the wing.
However, there are few players with greater experience than Italy's most-capped player.
Since his debut in 1988 he has amassed well over 100 caps.
Such longevity in the Azzurri side is testimony to Maldini's talent and leadership.
He has played as a libero and in central defence, but it is as a left-sided defender that he has demonstrated the technical skill, awareness and composure that has made him a class apart.
He is a calming and charismatic leader on the pitch and will be key to Italy's progress in the tournament.
The Queen made reference to his Only Fools and Horses character Del Boy as she presented him with his accolade.
It was later revealed the 65-year-old has married long-term partner Gill Hinchcliffe in a secret ceremony.
The couple, who have a four-year-old daughter Sophie Mae, wed in front of 12 family and friends at the Dorchester Hotel in London on Wednesday.
The actor is well-known for roles in comedy Open All Hours, detective drama A Touch of Frost and The Darling Buds of May.
"The Queen said 'you've been in the business a long time,'" Sir David said.
His character Del Boy would have reacted to the event with his usual Cockney charm, Sir David said.
Born in Edmonton, north London, Sir David - whose real name is David White - had a number of careers including a spell as a self-employed electrician before he became a theatre actor.
His big break came in 1976 when he starred in BBC sitcom Open All Hours alongside Ronnie Barker.
Five years later he was cast as Derek "Del Boy" Trotter in Only Fools and Horses, which went on to become the most popular comedy show of its time.
He has won a clutch of awards including a Bafta fellowship in 2003.
NBC, which makes the show, is in talks with the company behind Spooks to produce a London-based series, says industry paper The Hollywood Reporter.
In the US, the 18th season of the show began on Wednesday evening, making it the longest-running TV crime serial.
While the rights to Law and Order have never been sold, countries including France and Russia have their own versions of the drama.
It has been nominated at the Emmy awards every year from 1991 to 2003, winning outstanding drama series in1997.
Archive footage of Merce Cunningham
A statement from the Cunningham Dance Foundation said the New York-based dancer "died peacefully in his home of natural causes" on Sunday.
He formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in 1953 and choreographed nearly 200 works for it.
Although he used a wheelchair by the end of his career, Cunningham danced on stage well into his 80s.
The statement said he "revolutionised the visual and performing arts, not for the sake of iconoclasm, but for the beauty and wonder that lay in exploring new possibilities".
Radiohead have paid tribute to the dance star, calling him "kind and hospitable".
"Merce invited us to take part in his Split Sides project, in October 2003.
In April, Cunningham celebrated his 90th birthday with the premiere of new work Nearly Ninety - set to new music from Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and Sonic Youth - at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, in New York.
Last month, Cunningham set up The Living Legacy Plan, aimed at continuing his teachings in the future.
As part of the plan, Cunningham's work is to celebrated by his company with a two-year world tour culminating in a final performance in New York.
Born just after World War I in a small town near Seattle, Cunningham loved to dance as a child.
From 1939 to 1945, he was a soloist in the company of Martha Graham, regarded at the time as one of the foremost pioneers of modern dance.
He presented his first New York solo concert in April 1944, with music from composer John Cage, who became his life partner and frequent collaborator until Cage's death in 1992.
In a radical move, the couple decided to end the traditional marriage of movement and music, saying that both arts should exist independently even when sharing the same space.
Cunningham also abandoned conventional storytelling through ballet to focus entirely on the poetry of dance.
He even tossed coins or threw dice to determine steps, saying the use of chance was "a present mode of freeing my imagination from its own cliches".
He was hugely admired by other dancers and worked with visual artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol.
Cunningham's work has been presented by the New York City Ballet, Zurich Ballet and the Rambert Dance Company among others.
Among the accolades he received over his long career included the Kennedy Center Honors in 1985 and the National Medal of Arts in 1990.
Court papers said Iraqi-born Samir Vincent did business with Saddam Hussein, earning millions of dollars in the process.
The case is the first brought as part of the government's investigation into the $64bn programme.
It allowed Saddam Hussein to sell oil to buy civilian goods to ease the impact of UN sanctions.
US Attorney General John Ashcroft, who announced the guilty plea, said Vincent "was able to reap profits totalling millions of dollars by reselling these five allocations of Iraqi oil to an oil company".
He said Vincent admitted charges of fraud, tax violations and acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Iraqi government.
The charges carry a maximum sentence of up to 28 years in jail.
Mr Ashcroft said Vincent was co-operating with the Department of Justice as part of a plea deal.
Court papers say Vincent, who was born in Iraq in 1940, lobbied the US government and the UN to repeal Iraqi sanctions and ease restrictions on Iraqi oil sales on behalf of Saddam.
He helped draft agreements with Iraqi officials that guaranteed millions of dollars for himself and others once an agreement to sell Iraqi oil was obtained.
In one instance, Vincent and a company under his control were awarded the rights to buy about nine million barrels of oil for his lobbying work.
Set up in 1996, the UN oil-for-food programme was designed to ease the suffering caused by UN sanctions by allowing Iraq to sell its oil under UN supervision in order to buy food and medicines.
However, a report by former UN arms inspector Charles Duelfer found that the former Iraqi regime - which decided who could buy Iraqi oil - used the scheme to bribe people by awarding them contracts in return for a surcharge.
The court papers described it as a money machine for Saddam's regime, which allegedly stashed the cash in various Middle East countries and elsewhere.

Some pundits said the device compared badly with existing iPod music players in both its looks and onboard features.
Others questioned which group of consumers it was aimed at and whether people would be willing to pay a premium for such a device.
But some thought that the combination of Apple and Motorola could turn the gadget into a winner.
The iTunes phone, or Motorola Rokr E1 to give it its full name, was unveiled by Steve Jobs at an invitation-only event in San Francisco on 7 September.
"You've probably heard about this," Mr Jobs said introducing the device, alluding to the rampant speculation that preceded the announcement.
This limit is thought to have been imposed so the gadget does not cannibalise sales of full-blown iPods.
A dedicated button on the phone takes users to the music playing menu which looks and works like its equivalent on iPods.
The phone also vibrates in time to music and coloured lights on its side strobe to the sounds being played.
What sets the phone apart is its connection with iTunes which is currently closed to other devices.
But industry figures were unsure whether this would prove to be a big selling point.
"I'm not convinced that consumers will be ready to fork out �200 for a mobile phone handset as there are phones out there offering similar capabilities at a much lower cost through competitive tariffs," said Anthony Ball, director of mobile phone comparison service OneCompare.
"Apple will need to team up with a competitive network provider to add value to the product," he said.
Others thought that the Apple/Motorola combination was a potent one.
"If this phone is easy to use, at this price I think it will fly off the shelves," said Ed Snyder, analyst at Charter Equity.
Analysts believe that as the first in a line of phones, Apple and Motorola are hoping the Rokr E1 will define a new category of gadget like the iPod did.
Paul Lee, technology and telecoms research director at Deloitte, said the release of the phone raised all kinds of issues for mobile operators.
"It is worth remembering that the biggest downloaded music service is not MP3 downloads, rather it is ring tones, which still outsells, globally, MP3 downloads by a factor of 10 to 1," he said.
"Further, an operator is often able to charge more for a relatively small sized ring tone than it can charge for a technically challenging mp3 download," he added.

The Soil Association - who want to make organic food more popular - say the government only spends 35p per meal.
Their report says the meals aren't healthy enough to meet the government's own standards on how good food should be.
They're worried that too many cheap ingredients are being used instead of more expensive fresh ones.
The Soil Association want schools in England and Wales to be improved too, and want to see more than �200m spent to make food better.
The 11 men and one woman were remanded in custody on Monday after a court hearing.
They were arrested last Thursday for allegedly taking photographs at an air show at a military base near Kalamata in southern Greece.
The group have denied taking photographs inside a restricted military zone - a serious offence in Greece because of long-standing military tensions with neighbouring Turkey.
The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.
British diplomats said they understood the group had a written invitation to attend the air show, but one which would have included a strict no-photography clause.
They had expected the court would view the whole affair as a cultural misunderstanding - plane-spotting is almost unheard of in Greece - and release the group.
But the magistrate ruled they should be held at least until Friday so Greek security services could examine material seized from them.
An assessment of the group's photographs and notebooks will then be sent to the magistrate.
The flying club members - who were travelling with an organisation called Touchdown Tours - are being held in a jail in Kalamata.
The owner of Touchdown Tours, Paul Coppin from Suffolk, is one of those being held.
The company organises regular overseas trips for military aviation enthusiasts, including a similar trip to Greece last year.
Touchdown Tours' website said last year a group visited 18 bases in five days, logging more than 700 Greek military aircraft at bases including Kalamata.
In April 2002 they returned to face trial on lesser charges and were confident of being cleared.
Instead eight were found guilty of espionage and sentenced to three years in jail.
The other six were convicted of aiding and abetting and received a one-year suspended sentence.
Those who received prison sentences were allowed to leave Greece while their appeals were being heard.
In November 2002 13 of the plane-spotters returned to Greece and succeeded in overturning thier convictions.
Political correspondent Naomi Grimley gives us an update on who's in the running.
Basic bank accounts are like current accounts, but offer no overdraft or cheque book.
They should be an option for people who do not qualify for a current account because they have a history of bad debt.
But Gordon Wilson, from Glasgow, told Money Box he has been refused a basic account at RBS, Natwest and the Bank of Scotland, on exactly these grounds.
"All three have said that due to outstanding debts I have, I've not been able to pass a credit score, and they are not willing to provide a bank account for me," he said.
The Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) said staff see a lot of people who have been turned down for banks because they have been credit checked.
Policy officer Tony Herbert said, "This does seem somewhat bizarre given these accounts offer no credit.
"Unfortunately, what we find happening is that bank branch staff will automatically enter someone's details into a computer to see what account they are suitable for.
And he said this can have ramifications for people trying to get a job - employers tend to want to pay your wage electronically, in which case, you need a bank account.
When he needed to furnish his flat, Mr Wilson's lack of payment options meant he had to walk around Glasgow with up to £1,000 cash in his pocket.
The British Bankers' Association (BBA) said banks are not obliged to accept customers if they are bankrupt, or if they have a record of fraud - neither of which applies to Mr Wilson.
But it said customers should not be refused a basic account because of their credit history.
The three banks Mr Wilson approached - RBS, Natwest and Bank of Scotland - all said they do not refuse people with poor credit histories.
Although the Bank of Scotland admits branch staff sometimes do make mistakes.
But Money Box has found that there is also a wide variation in terms of what the different basic accounts offer.
Six out of 17 basic bank accounts - about a third - do not offer a debit card, according to the latest figures from the Financial Services Authority.
These include big names like Santander, HSBC and Nationwide.
Debit cards allow customers to pay for goods electronically in shops and online.
This lack of access to basic banking services is being blamed for the rising number of people who have benefits loaded directly onto pre-paid cards.
Mr Herbert, from CAB, said, "We know of people with mobility problems who want to do their shopping online but do not have a debit card.
Ms McCarthy-Fry agreed the accounts do vary, and that customers should choose one that does offer a debit card.

General Sefer Halilovic, 49, the highest-ranking Muslim officer to be indicted by the court, is accused of failing to prevent the killing of 33Bosnian Croat civilians in the village of Grabovica in September 1993.
He has protested his innocence of the charge, which the court classifies as "responsibility by omission".
General Halilovic helped to form the Bosnian army when war broke out in Bosnia Hercegovina in 1992, and was its commander until November 1993.
He is currently serving as Refugee and Social Affairs Minister of the Muslim-Croat federation which, together with the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska, makes up post-war Bosnia.
The general was escorted to Sarajevo airport by UN and Bosnian police, and flew to The Hague on a UN aircraft.
His lawyer, Faruk Balijagic, described the charges as "doubtful", saying there was concrete evidence that his client had ordered an investigation into crimes committed in Grabovica.
The Bosnian Serb leadership welcomed the indictment.
The paper quoted the Serb member of Bosnia's three-party presidency, Zivko Radisic, as saying that the indictment showed the tribunal was applying the same criteria to all war crimes suspects regardless of their nationality.
The Bosnian Serb parliament is in the process of implementing a law on co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic, are the tribunal's most wanted men.
General Halilovic is among 15 suspects from the Muslim-Croat federation who are being sought by the tribunal, most of them Bosnian or Croat generals.
Local media have reported that nine of the indictees are about to hand themselves over to the tribunal, and that those who do not go voluntarily are likely to be arrested.
"We took a joint decision with Lado Gurgenidze that he will no longer serve as prime minister," the president told a meeting of MPs.
Mr Saakashvili said he was promoting Georgia's ambassador to Turkey, Grigol Mgaloblishvili, to prime minister.
Mr Mgaloblishvili, 35, will be asked to submit a new list of cabinet ministers for parliament's approval.
The president said Mr Gurgenidze, a former banker who has been in office for a year, would head a new financial commission focusing on the stabilisation of Georgia's financial system.
The conflict in August has dented investor confidence and damaged the country's previously healthy growth.
The conflict in the region began on 7 August when Georgia tried to retake its breakaway region of South Ossetia by force after a series of lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels.
Russia launched a counter-attack and the Georgian troops were ejected from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a second breakaway region, days later.
Russian forces remain in the two regions, and Moscow has backed their declarations of independence.
Georgia's opposition parties swung behind the government during the fighting, but have since resumed criticism of Mr Saakashvili.
The suicide bomber wounded at least four others when he blew himself up in a fast-food shop on a busy street in the first such attack in the city in nearly six weeks.
In another incident, suspected Palestinian gunmen shot dead two Jewish settlers near Nablus, in the northern West Bank.
Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli soldiers killed a knife-wielding Palestinian in the West Bank settlement of Itamar near Nablus, the army said.
The man had got into a home and wounded a settler and his wife, before security forces were alerted and shot the attacker.
Israel has been on a high alert since its forces killed a leading member of the militant Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip last week.
Tuesday's explosion was the first suicide bombing in Jerusalem since a pair of attacks in mid-June killed 26 Israelis and prompted the army to occupy seven of the eight major West Bank towns.
However the device appeared to have gone off prematurely, and some reports say this is possibly why there were relatively few casualties.
Most of the injured suffered from shrapnel wounds, Israeli public television said.
The blast, near King George Street, occurred in one of the most heavily guarded areas of the city centre which divides traditionally Arab east Jerusalem from west Jerusalem, the Associated Press news agency said.
An official in the office of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, David Baker, condemned the bombing, saying it was proof that the Palestinian Authority "continues to believe that terror will further its goals and this is mistaken".
Israel has blamed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for attacks on its civilians, and accuses the Palestinian Authority of doing nothing to stop militant groups.
However the Palestinians argue that Israel's military assaults on its cities and security forces have left them with little ability to prevent attack
Earlier on Tuesday, two settlers were shot dead in the West Bank as they drove through the Palestinian village of Jammaien.
The army said troops were searching for the gunmen.
The BBC's Claire Marshall in Jerusalem says that despite the ongoing conflict, business contacts are often maintained between individual settlers and local Palestinians.
According to a statement sent to the French news agency AFP, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades - an armed offshoot Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement - said it carried out the ambush.
Jewish settlers have frequently been targeted by Palestinians during the 22-month intifada.
Israeli settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law.
What were the main issues?
The country's economy is in crisis, but this does not appear to have been a key factor influencing voters this time around.
Why did Ariel Sharon hang on to power?
Paradoxically, opinion polls regularly show that many Israelis support the Palestinian policy of Mr Sharon's main rival Labour's Amram Mitzna.
However, Mr Mitzna's campaign failed to take off and many Israelis are at the moment in no mood for messages of compromise.
Many Israelis also blame Labour for the collapse of the Oslo peace accords.
How easy will it be to form a government?
Israel is always ruled by a governing coalition because no party ever wins the minimum 61 seats in the Knesset (parliament) to rule alone.
The size of Mr Sharon's Likud victory means it must look for at least two other parties to join a coalition.
The Likud leader favours a broad-based coalition with Labour - which has 19 seats according to provisional results - but Mr Mitzna has ruled out joining a Sharon-led coalition.
The third largest force following the election is the secular Shinui party,which is to the right of Labour, with 15 seats.
But it has said it would refuse to serve in a coalition with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party that was part of the outgoing national unity government.
In the new Knesset, Shas will be the fourth largest party with 11 seats, down from 17.
Thus, Mr Sharon could be forced to turn to far-right and religious parties for his coalition, though such a grouping is seen as unstable.
Mr Sharon, himself, accused "extreme rightist parties" of having caused the fall of two right-wing Israeli governments in 1992 and 1999.
What does the election mean for the peace process?
Any attempt to revive the process would be fraught with problems if Mr Sharon is forced into a coalition with rightist and religious parties.
While Mr Sharon says he will pursue a "two-state solution" called for by President George W Bush - which includes for an establishment of a Palestinian state - this would be opposed by the far right.
And right-wing parties and would be likely to take an even more hawkish line against the 28-month-old Palestinian uprising for an independent state than the current government.
If, however, Mr Sharon can rebuild a broad government of national unity with Labour it is difficult to see where the peace process could go, given that the prime minister has rejected most of Labour's traditional peace-making policies.
Why were early elections held?
Mr Sharon's attempt to build a small majority coalition with right-wing parties failed and he chose to seek a new mandate rather than lead with a minority government.
Yet only on Monday the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was saying as she left Jerusalem that she hoped for a ceasefire resolution to be passed by the Security Council by the end of the week.
It seems that Israeli determination had been underestimated.
A late-night meeting of the seven-strong security cabinet decided to expand the military operation further into Lebanon.
But with fighting still heavy in border villages, going to the Litani along its length would need a considerable force.
Human Rights Watch said on Monday Israel was creating a "free-fire" zone in southern Lebanon.
And if Israel occupies any Lebanese land for any period, it runs the risk of getting bogged down in a guerrilla war.
Indeed such is the confusion in the Israeli camp that Israel's leading military commentator Ze'ev Schiff of Haaretz has concluded that "management of the war has been incompetent".
He points out that it has already gone on for nearly as long as the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
He also indicated that Israel would not leave Lebanon until its two missing soldiers were returned.
Did Ms Rice misread the Israeli mood, which seems to be more committed than perhaps some optimistic outsiders have realised?
The episode raises the question as to whether Israel and not the Bush administration is calling the shots.
Israeli officials say the air force has destroyed about two-thirds of the longer-range Zelzal rockets Hezbollah is said to have (although nobody is talking actual numbers, nor do they say how they know).
And crucially Hezbollah's agreement or acquiescence will have to be sought.
Religious orders are advertising for people to try being a nun or a monk for a weekend in an attempt to slow the decline of new vocations.
In 2007, Catholic orders had just 29 novices in England and Wales, down from over 200 in 1972.
Yvonne Murray visited Worth Abbey in Sussex to discover why people would want a monastic weekend.
In total 13 prisoners committed suicide at North East jails in 2002 - six of them at Durham.
Holme House in Stockton-on-Tees had the second-highest suicide rate, with five prisoners killing themselves while in custody.
Durham's governor Mike Newell described the deaths as " a conundrum", but said prison staff were doing everything possible to prevent further deaths.
The Howard League for Penal Reform, which produced the figures, blamed the suicides mainly on prison overcrowding.
The suicides at Durham are a particular concern because none were recorded at all in the previous two years.
"The problem is that we do not.
"It is incredibly complex and there are issues like mental health and drugs which play a part.
"What we are trying to do is run a decent prison where problems are tackled and people feel safe in this environment.
"Things have changed in that there are more prisoners in custody and with that comes overcrowding and pressures on staff.
"We have put more and more effort into trying to give support to prisoners who may harm themselves.
In England and Wales 94 prisoners committed suicide in 2002, the majority being males aged between 26 and 30.

David Mirfin's looping first-half header put Scunthorpe ahead but Jaime Peters levelled after the restart.
This inspired the visitors and they had several chances to go ahead with Darren O'Dea's shot against the bar the best.
Jonathan Forte had a late chance for Scunthorpe but a combination of Gareth McAuley's challenge and Marton Fulop's save denied him a goal.
Scunthorpe dominated possession in the opening stages, with Martyn Woolford and Rob Jones having chances , before Forte wasted the first decent chance of the game, heading Eddie Nolan's cross over the bar from eight yards out.
Jones had another opportunity when he headed Josh Wright's corner wide, but Scunthorpe earned their reward for their early pressure on the half-hour mark when Sam Togwell put the ball back in the box after a corner was cleared, and Mirfin was left unmarked to head his side in front.
Ipswich manager Roy Keane made instant changes, taking off Connor Wickham for Luke Hyam, and the reshuffle seemed to work as the visitors got more into the match.
Jason Scotland should have done better when he failed to connect with Carlos Edwards' cross, and Edwards' regular long throws also put Scunthorpe on the back foot.
Perters replaced Andros Townsend at half-time and within 12 minutes he had put Ipswich back on level terms, as Cliff Byrne's attempted interception ricocheted off Peters, leaving him with a simple finish.
Scunthorpe keeper Joe Murphy then made a fine save from Edwards and Scotland wasted another great chance to score when Byrne's superbly-timed tackle denied him a tap-in finish.
One of Edwards's trademark long throws set up O'Dea for a shot against the bar with Murphy well beaten, and substitute Tamas Priskin wasted a great chance when he headed over from close range.
But it was not just one-way traffic, with Scunthorpe going close themselves towards the end.
First Forte was kept out by the combined efforts of McAuley and Fulop, and then with four minutes remaining the same player wasted a great chance, beating two defenders before producing a disappointing shot wide of the post.

Some 28% of easy access accounts offer a rate of 5% or more, compared with 8% that offered rates equal to, or above, the base rate two years ago.
The figures from analysts Defaqto show that banks are trying to attract savers during the credit crunch.
Meanwhile, new guidelines have been issued to quicken the transfer of Isas.
The banking industry has agreed to speed up the transfer of cash between these tax-free accounts.
Defaqto's analysis showed that 28% of accounts were paying equal to or more than the Bank of England interest rate of 5% for deposits of �5,000.
This compared with 21% at the same time last year, 8% in August 2006, and 19% in the same month of 2005.
But the group said that savers needed to be alert to the fact that relatively few accounts did not have any restrictions, such as when customers try to withdraw cash.
"It is encouraging to see so many accounts offering attractive headline rates but savers need to keep their wits about them to avoid choosing an unsuitable account," said Defaqto's banking consultant David Black.
Examination of 50 instant or easy access accounts paying the highest rates found that 15 of them limited the number of withdrawals or imposed penalties on some withdrawals.
Eighteen of them had introductory bonuses, which meant interest rates dropped after a set time limit expired.
Eleven of the 50 accounts had a minimum withdrawal of �100 or higher.
This left 19 out of the 50 that were free of withdrawal restrictions or introductory bonuses.
In a separate development, the bank and building society industry has issued guidelines to standardise the transfer of cash between Isa accounts.
This should cut the amount of time that it takes for customers to shift their cash to providers offering higher interest rates - a process that occasionally left consumers frustrated because it could take months.
The next stage is for the system to be computerised which would streamline it further.
Depression is two to three times more common in patients with problems such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
NICE recommends structural physical activities and talking therapies for mild to moderate problems.
But charities said the guidance could be interpreted as an excuse to cut face-to-face counselling services.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence says chronic physical health problems can have a serious impact on an individual's psychological wellbeing.
It says doctors should be alert to possible depression, particularly in patients with a past history of depression or where the health problem causes serious functional impairment.
The new guidance sets out two key questions patients should be asked if a doctor suspects they may be at risk of depression.
"Or have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?"
If the patient says yes, the doctor should refer a patient on to a specialist or, if they are trained in mental health assessment, ask a further three questions.
These will check if the patient has, in the last month, been bothered by feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration or thoughts of death.
The doctor should also consider if the patient is receiving the best kind of treatment for their physical health problem, ask about history of depression and whether relationships or living conditions are having an impact.
NICE says structured group physical activities, peer support or self-help based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and computerised CBT should be used for mild to moderate depression.
It also recommends couples therapy for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the depression, or where involving the partner can be a therapeutic benefit.
Nice says antidepressants should only be considered for patients with a past history of moderate or severe depression, those who have mild depression that complicates the care of the physical health problem, or those whose depression has lasted for at least two years or persists after other treatments.
Barry Sheerman, chair of the Commons select committee on schools, said teachers were being treated unfairly.
The Department of Children, Schools and Families said it was working hard to improve the handling of allegations.
Unions argue that teachers faced with abuse allegations or claims they used excessive force against pupils, face suspension, police investigation and unfair disciplinary systems.
And even if the teacher's name is cleared, the complaint is still on record.
Chris Keates, General Secretary of NASUWT, said 800-plus complaints were being made against its members annually and the vast majority related to the way teachers dealt with difficult situations in the classroom.
"It's a blight on the modern teaching profession," she told BBC File On 4.
She claimed that unlike a criminal case, teachers faced with disciplinary action over complaints from pupil had to prove their innocence.
Mr Sheerman said thousands of teachers were being affected by false complaints with their careers left in ruins.
The Department for Children, Schools and Families told the BBC, "Guidance on more consistent and swifter handling of allegations was issued for education in 2005.

The poll of 3,000 teachers found more than one in three expected pupils with certain names to be more disruptive.
Pupils called Callum, Connor, Jack, Chelsea, Courtney and Chardonnay were among some of the ones to watch.
But it is not all bad news, with 57% of the teachers surveyed saying the naughtier children tended to be more popular than their better behaved peers.
More than a third said the naughtiest pupils were often the brightest and the more sensitive.
Many teachers (69%) said they had difficulty pronouncing some of the more obscure names chosen by parents.
And 71% of teachers admitted to have a private chuckle over some of the more unusual names.
The survey also asked teachers what the brightest children tended to be called, with Alexander, Adam, Christopher, Benjamin, Edward, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Emma, Hannah and Rebecca coming in as the brainiest names.
Names of the most popular children in the class included Jack, Daniel, Charlie, Callum, Emma, Charlotte, Hannah and Anna.
"Rightly or wrongly, most of us make assumptions based on something as simple as a person's name and we base these on our previous experiences.
What did (Gordon Brown) think at the time [about Iraq]?
And did he think he'd be shuffled out?
So he had serious concerns about what his personal position would be if the war went ahead, and it was a quick and successful war?
And did Gordon Brown speak out against the war in the cabinet?
Did he explicitly, privately, tell you that it was wrong?
Lisa Norris, who was 15 and from Girvan in Ayrshire, died a few months after the treatment at Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow in 2006.
The inquiry was abandoned after all parties agreed her illness caused her death rather than the overdose.
The proceedings were formally wound up at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday.
Miss Norris was given 58% too much radiation during her treatment at the Beatson and died at her family home on 18 October 2006.
An internal inquiry following her death found that she had died from her tumour and not from the overdose.
However, that was disputed by an independent report from one of the country's top cancer experts.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday, Procurator Fiscal Lesley Thomson said any disagreement among experts had now been resolved.
"The medical experts who are all in full possession of the facts and the initial differing opinions have ultimately concluded that there is no causal link between the radiation overdose and Lisa's death," she said.
Ms Thomson said that the Norris family also accepted this conclusion and were of the opinion that a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) should not go ahead.
"Shortly after the continued preliminary hearing on 22 February the representatives of Lisa's family advised me that the family had reached the view that they were content that a full investigation had been carried out, that there was no causal link between the radiation overdose and Lisa's death and that they did not want the fatal accident inquiry and the leading of evidence now to take place," she said.
Ms Thomson told the court that as there were "no matters of dispute that require to be aired in public, it is not appropriate to cause any further anxiety and distress to the bereaved relatives by the hearing of evidence".
She asked for the fatal accident inquiry to be abandoned and said such a move would also avoid any unnecessary expenses to the parties involved and the public purse.
Ms Thomson also asked that the court make a formal determination that Miss Norris died as a result of "recurrent pineoblastoma" or brain tumour.
That was agreed to by Sheriff Principal James Alistair Taylor.
Miss Norris's father, Ken, did not want to comment directly on the proceedings.
"After further inquiry the professor revised his report to say it was a possibility, not a probability.
"Proof in Scots law is based on the balance of probabilities and that is not enough for the fiscal to proceed with the fatal accident inquiry.
Mr Fyfe said the Norris family would continue its civil action against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over the treatment she was given.
However, they will now seek compensation only for the pain and suffering that Miss Norris went through as a result of the overdose, and not for her death.
Hughes, a controversial choice as overseas player with the Ashes looming, was not out on exactly 100 as Middlesex closed day two on 174-1.
They still require a further 182 to avoid the follow-on after Glamorgan racked up 505 after resuming on 351-6.
Mark Wallace, 58 overnight, went on to make 128, and David Harrison 51.
But it was Hughes who took top billing, taking full advantage of his chance to acclimatise to English conditions before the Ashes starts later this summer after spending four-and-a-half sessions in the field.
The 20-year-old left-hander did not take long to get into his stride, cutting and slashing at anything short of a length outside his off stump.
He scored 42 by tea and reached his century, which included 17 fours, in the final over of the day with a single wide of short third man.
It was Hughes' eighth first-class hundred in only his 22nd first-class appearance.
He was given ample support by opening partner Billy Godleman (23) and then shared in an unbroken second-wicket stand of 107 with Neil Dexter (43), although Glamorgan remain very much in the driving seat thanks to their big first-innings total.
Schumacher ended Ferrari's 21-year wait for the drivers' championship in 2000.
"Michael brought Ferrari from 21 years of not winning a world title to being champions many times," said Stewart.
Di Montezemolo was appointed president and managing director of Ferrari in 1991 while Todt took over as team boss in 1993.
Schumacher followed in 1996, making the switch from F1 rivals Benetton.
He could make it six in Brazil on Sunday in his final race before retirement but needs to win at Interlagos and hope championship leader Fernando Alonso fails to score a point.
"Michael's greatest skill has been able to motivate people to come with him and raise the bar to create the best car that he could drive and get the success they wish to have," said Stewart, who was world champion three times.
"Generally speaking, I think it's true to say he re-shaped Ferrari and made the Ferrari the car it is today.
Yet despite Schumacher's unrivalled success, Stewart is reluctant to class him as the greatest driver of all time.
"Michael has one flaw in my view that there is hardly a weekend that he hasn't been off the road at one time or another and sometimes several times because he stretches the elastic a tad too far," said the 67-year-old Scot.
"Now maybe he knows that if he goes off today's tracks are so safe he's not going to do any real damage to the car or himself, but still you're in the hands of the gods once you leave the black-top.
China suffered shortages in the summer, as temperatures soared and air conditioning units used up energy.
While cooler weather has temporarily helped, the need for heating and maintenance will soon mean facilities cannot meet demand, officials said.
China's current power generation capacity is struggling to keep up with the country's rapid economic growth.
Cheng Guangjie, vice president of the East China Power Grid, said the eastern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Fujian, and the city of Shanghai, are all likely to be hit by power shortages in the coming months.
The paper commented that China currently produces one-thirteenth the amount of electricity per head that the US generates, and one-eighth the amount per person of Japan.
It said that last year, 23 of China's 31 provinces and major cities had to ration power, up from 12 regions in 2002.
Construction of new power plants are expected to help resolve shortages by 2006.
Angela Merkel said she wanted to be a chancellor "for all Germans"
Mrs Merkel told supporters they had achieved "something magnificent", but said she wanted to be a chancellor of all Germans at a moment of crisis.
Mrs Merkel's bloc now looks set to form a centre-right alliance with her preferred partner, the pro-reform FDP.
She says the alliance will get Germany out of its worst crisis in 60 years.
Projections by national broadcasters, based on partial vote counts and exit polls, gave Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrat CDU/CSU bloc 33% of the vote, with the Social Democrat SPD at about 23% - its worst result since World War II.
The Free Democrats took about 15%, the Left party 12% and the Greens 10%.
Analysts say the combined 48% for the CDU and FDP should allow them to form a stable majority government in Germany, Europe's largest economy and the biggest member of the European Union.
It was the preferred outcome for both parties, though there are expected to be talks before a coalition is formalised.
It means the SPD, which has been the junior partner in the "grand coalition" for the past four years, will be ejected from government.
The left-right coalition, the so-called "grand coalition" between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats can now be consigned to history.
Angela Merkel will still be chancellor tomorrow but overnight the political landscape will have changed completely.
He said his party would be "vigilant in opposition".
And he said it "would not be very sensible" to resign, vowing "to go on fighting".
Although the results are not yet final, they were decisive enough for the leaders of the US, Britain and France to send their congratulations to Mrs Merkel.
But the chancellor appeared delighted, as the new coalition line-up could give her a freer hand to pursue economic reform.
"Our main objective has been achieved, namely a change of government, which for me is what really counts this evening," a smiling Mrs Merkel told cheering supporters in Berlin.
"I would not tell anyone to remain sober, but we don't want to forget that there are many problems in our country to be solved," she added.
She said she would hold "swift and decisive" talks with FDP leader Guido Westerwelle, whom some are tipping as the next foreign minister.
Mr Westerwelle said the new government would act "responsibly".
University of Michigan scientists have identified a gene variant found more often in people who said their first cigarette produced a "buzz".
These people were much more likely to go on to become regular smokers, the journal Addiction reports.
The researchers say the finding may help development of anti-smoking drugs.
A person's decision to smoke for the first time, or carry on smoking, is not thought to be governed solely by his or her genes, but a mixture of genes, environmental factors and social pressures.
However, scientists are hoping that by cracking the genetic secrets of nicotine addiction, they could make it easier for people to wean themselves off cigarettes, or even stop them taking up the habit in the first place.
The gene in question, CHRNA5, has already been highlighted by other studies into nicotine addiction, and it has been suggested that it could increase a smoker's chance of developing lung cancer.
The Michigan research, however, suggests that it could be at work from the very first instance of exposure to nicotine.
Genetic data was obtained from 435 volunteers, some of whom were regular smokers, and some who had tried cigarettes but were not currently smokers.
They were quizzed about how they felt about their first smoking experience.
Regular smokers were far more likely to have the variant version of the gene and more likely to report that their first smoking experience was pleasurable.
Dr Marcus Munafo, from Bristol University, said that while the study was interesting, any treatments or tests based on the gene variant would be some way off.
But on the eve of a possible US-led attack on Iraq all that has changed - people are subdued, fearful of what the future holds.
Cairo is inextricably linked to Baghdad - they were the twin centres of civilisation during the classical Golden Age enjoyed by the Arabs in medieval times, and together they make up the backdrop for that greatest work of Arabic folk literature, the Arabian Nights.
Most people here mistrust the US pursuit of Iraqi weapons, and feel outrage at President George W Bush's mission to bring about the downfall of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.
"I don't like the guy," says a young mother, who has spent time abroad, referring with disdain to the Iraqi dictator.
"But why does America have the right to depose him? Are they going to catch him like they caught Bin Laden?" she says.
Washington may have lost its credibility here in Cairo, but many citizens concur with Tuesday morning's US ultimatum that Saddam go into exile - though not within the 48-hour deadline proposed by President Bush.
As well as sparing 20 million Iraqis from the threat of war, the exile solution conveniently points a way out of Egypt's current biting economic crisis, which has seen import costs rocket after the floating of the Egyptian pound against the dollar.
Peace could save the fragile tourism sector from collapse.
And a newly placated Washington could set about providing economic help to its friend, Egypt, to prevent instability elsewhere spreading to the region's biggest country.
War, on the other hand - perhaps a long, bloody war, if Saddam's Republican Guards put up a fight around Baghdad - means all bets are off for Egypt's recovery, as well as any progress on that other open wound in Arab minds, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Nevertheless, this darker scenario has many supporters on the streets of Cairo.
So how are Cairo residents spending the last few hours before Iraq - and the rest of the region - meets its fate in the shape of the Bush administration's final ultimatum?
On Monday night, the intellectual elite packed into a hall at the American University in Cairo (AUC) to hear a lecture on Palestinian human rights by the renowned US-Palestinian academic Edward Said, followed by a lute recital by the Cairo-based Iraqi virtuoso Naseer Shama.
Shama's lute mimics the sweet sound of children's games, then an air-raid siren, then the sound of aircraft and bombs falling and the screams of Amariya's 450 civilian victims.
Outside the ivory towers of the AUC, many of the rest of Cairo's 18 million population are going about their business with an air of resignation as the clock ticks to Thursday morning's deadline.
And simple people, unschooled in the intricacies of international diplomacy, ask foreigners - not for baksheesh these days - but for explanations about the political situation.
Will Iraq burn its oilfields? Why does Tony Blair support George Bush when the British people don't? And why can't the Middle East region live in peace, when that's what the overwhelming majority of Egyptian people say is all they want.
With such a legacy, you might imagine that legal precision and obedience were second-nature to Iraqis.
Law and order broke down straight after the US-led invasion in March 2003.
For many Iraqis, "democracy" meant doing exactly what you felt like, when you felt like it - including behind the wheel of a car.
Traffic signals and direction signs became museum pieces, fragments of a dead language.
You might see a 13-year-old boy driving a pick-up at high speed in the wrong lane, or a driver stopping his car in the middle of the road to chat to a friend.
Or you might pull over at the sound of an ambulance siren, only to find that someone had rigged one to a donkey cart.
Of course, senior officials travelled in convoys at top speed in the wrong direction - and would be followed by a trail of madcap drivers trying to keep open this temporary gap in the congestion.
Of whom I became one of the first.
As the young man started writing out the paperwork for my fine, I asked him why he stopped me when it was plain to see that virtually every other driver wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
When Saddam Hussein was in power, the military used to complain about their rations, and that sewer water was cleaner than the drinking water they were issued with.
Now, a friend of mine who owns a supermarket here says his supplies of bottled water come from an Iraqi army brigade that would rather have a few extra dollars in their pockets than drink healthy water.
Bribery, corruption, greed - it takes more than the law to halt them.
Finding ice on the Moon is a major discovery that could set the course of the human exploration of space for the next 20 years.
It would make the Moon a much more attractive place to build a manned base.
Oxygen makes up half the weight of lunar rocks and is straightforward to extract, requiring only energy that may come from small nuclear power plants or from solar power.
Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are the fuel of the Space Shuttle.
Ninety-nine per cent of the energy used to get rocket fuel into space is spent launching it the first 150 miles from the surface of the Earth into Earth orbit.
Because the Moon has weaker gravity it would require less energy to send rocket fuel to Earth orbit from the Moon than it would to send it up from the Earth's surface.
The Lunar Prospector spacecraft is a small and relatively cheap craft that was launched with one main goal - to find out if there is ice on the moon.
The area around South Pole Crater is one of the most remarkable places in the solar system.
On its western limb is the so-called "Peak of Eternal Light" a region of the moon that is in constant sunlight.
Since Lunar Prospector entered orbit and began is survey of the Moon, scientists have been delighted with the data it has been sending back.
MF Husain had been accused of obscenity and was denounced by hardline Hindus for a painting of a nude goddess in the shape of the Indian map.
The court said Mr Husain's paintings were not obscene and nudity was common in Indian iconography and history.
Mr Husain says he is looking forward to returning home from self-imposed exile.
The Supreme Court also upheld a lower court ruling in May that dropped legal proceedings in three cases against the painter and cleared him of obscenity charges.
Under Indian laws, obscenity is a criminal offence.
In its ruling, the court said that the nudity portrayed by Mr Husain had a long history.
"There are many such pictures, paintings and sculptures and some of them are in temples also," it said.
"At last they have understood the dignity of Indian contemporary art," he was quoted as saying by the Times of India newspaper.
Last year, art auction house Christie's rejected demands by a group of expatriate Indians to withdraw the work of Mr Husain.
The group had threatened to hold demonstrations unless the auction was dropped.
Over the years, his exhibitions have often been attacked by hardline Hindu groups, angry over a series of paintings depicting Hindu goddesses in the nude.
He promised to withdraw the controversial painting from a charity auction, after Hindu nationalist groups accused him of hurting their religious sentiments.
Mr Husain, 92, is one of India's leading painters.
His paintings are much sought after and are auctioned for millions of dollars.
A group of Iraqi men claim they were tortured and 20 compatriots murdered at a UK base after a fire-fight in 2004.
Mr Justice Silber said he was "at a loss" as to why no inquiry terms of reference had been presented.
The hearing will resume on 16 October.
The High Court had been hearing a legal challenge over the MoD's refusal to set up an independent inquiry into the deaths in southern Iraq in 2004.
Judges criticised the government for failing to disclose relevant documents to the court quickly enough.
Armed Forces Minister Bill Rammell apologied for the failure to disclose, blaming it on record-keeping problems and stressed there was no evidence to support the allegations being made against British troops.
"For these allegations to be true, it would have involved a massive conspiracy involving huge numbers of people," he said.
"There is no evidence whatsoever for this.
"Nevertheless, because of our failings of disclosure and the unwillingness of the Metropolitan Police to investigate, we are committing to an independent public inquiry.
In July, ministers conceded there was a need for a new investigation into the deaths.
The Ministry of Defence has since said it has taken "every conceivable step" to allow an inquiry to be held as soon as possible.
Lawyers for the six Iraqi men claim the civilians were killed after capture - not during fighting, as the British military claims - at the Battle of Danny Boy.
The court has already heard claims UK troops tortured the men before killing them.
Civilians were allegedly detained following the battle between British soldiers and Iraqi insurgents near Al Majar-al-Kabir in Maysan province on 14 May 2004.
Lawyers for the Iraqis have produced medical evidence in court they claim supports allegations that captives were taken to the UK's Camp Abu Naji, where they were tortured, murdered, and their bodies mutilated.
The six Iraqis who called for the inquiry include the uncle of one of those who died and five others who allege they were also mistreated.
The MoD says the dead were killed on the battlefield and denies wrongdoing.
But the judgement also criticised the Royal Military Police's handling of investigations.
It added that the detainees who had alleged that they were abused were not even interviewed about what had happened.
Lord Justice Scott Baker also spoke of his concern about "computers disappearing into the Channel" - a reference to an apparent attempt to get rid of evidence.
New studies by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have revealed the fall.
Teams patrol watersides in winter to count species and numbers of birds.
Their work covers the Wash, Morecambe Bay, Norfolk coast, Solway Firth and the estuaries of the Humber, Thames, Dee and Mersey in the period 2001-04.
Ducks, geese and waders are attracted by the relatively warmer winter conditions in the Gulf Stream protected British Isles but, claims the BTO, global warming could be persuading migrating birds to stay in cooler northern and eastern waters.
Britain is the winter home for about 10 million wetland birds and the Wash sees populations of 350,000, while other sites and the estuaries have numbers of more than 100,000.
However, heavy development of traditional sites in the south of England have seen loss of habitat which has caused the bird populations to move away.
Signs are growing that all is not well for a range of geese, ducks and wading birds.
For species such as the grey plover and dark-bellied brent goose, whose populations peaked in the early 1990s, after long periods of increase, numbers are now declining steadily.
But numbers of little egrets, pink-footed geese, gadwall and black-tailed godwit are all reaching record levels.
At Bolton Crown Court, Iram Hussain admitted causing the deaths of Gary Proctor, 47, and James Proctor, 16, by dangerous driving.
The two, from Wakefield, died after the crash on 3 August between junction 19 and 20 near Birch services.
Hussain, of Como Avenue, Bradford was twice the drink-drive limit.
Mr Proctor's wife, Catherine, aged 44, survived the crash, but suffered serious rib and arm injuries.
The family were on on their way to Manchester Airport for a holiday in Florida.
A charge of making a threat to kill a petrol station attendant in Leeds was allowed to lie on Hussain's file.
He was arrested at the scene of the accident, after his Audi Quattro struck the back of the Proctors' Fiat Punto on the westbound carriageway.
Hussain was remanded in custody until 8 December when he will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court.
Figures from the Scottish Executive showed that a total of 580 pupils were known to have been taken out of school by their parents in 2005/06.
A further 130 youngsters learning at home, had never been to school.
The Scottish Executive said parents were becoming more aware of education options, particularly since statutory guidance was introduced in 2002.
Alison Preuss, of the Schoolhouse Home Education Association, said she was not surprised by the rise in home educators.
"Schoolhouse tends to get enquiries from parents having problems with their children at school," she said.
"Bullying is the biggest issue along with special needs, and rural school closures.
Ms Preuss said the statutory guidance ensured that parents were not "fobbed off" when they approached councils for information about home education.
She said information was also more readily available and there was a growing network of home educators across the country.
It would mean their owners could be traced and fined for letting them poo on the streets.
City officials in Frankfurt are fed up with pooches fouling all over the place.
So they've suggested the idea of large number plates which would go round the dogs' necks.
Then members of the public could let officials know which dogs had done their business where they shouldn't.
"If they (owners) know their dog can get them rumbled, they might just think twice about it".

Two second-half goals ensured Portsmouth swept aside 10-man Watford and climbed above the Hornets into 17th place in the Championship table.
Marko Futacs nodded in David Norris's corner before Watford goalkeeper Scott Loach saved from Dave Kitson.
But Loach went from hero to villain when he was sent off for dragging down Futacs outside the box.
Portsmouth pressed forward and sealed victory when Hayden Mullins converted Erik Huseklepp's 87th-minute cross.
Portsmouth's win was well-deserved and their first in four matches.
They dominated the first half but Norris and Huseklepp both failed to find the target from distance early on.
At the other end, Marvin Sordell's deflected effort just before the break was as close as Watford came in the opening period.
The home fans had to wait just nine minutes into the second half, though, before Pompey converted their dominance into a lead, as Norris and Liam Lawrence's short-corner routine picked out Hungarian Futacs.
Lawrence had a goal disallowed and Norris brought a superb save out of Loach before the goalkeeper hauled down Futacs and was duly dismissed.
Watford boss Sean Dyche brought on Jonathan Bond, but the substitute goalkeeper could do nothing about Mullins' powerful finish after blocking his initial shot.

This week the Iraqi Olympic Committee disbanded the IFA and security forces seized control of its headquarters.
World football's governing body Fifa called the move "incomprehensible" and gave 72 hours for order to be restored.
The warning was not heeded and clubs and representative teams of Iraq cannot now compete in international matches, whether friendly or competitive.
One competition the Emergency Committee has relented on is an U-16 women's regional football festival organised by the Norwegian Football Association in Jordan between 22 and 29 November.
Iraq's Olympic committee and the IFA have had a long-running dispute over who controls the game in the country.
Olympic committee members blame the IFA for a continuing Fifa ban on the country hosting international matches, because of fears over insecurity.
This year Fifa did allow Iraq to host its first international friendlies since the American-led invasion of 2003, two games against Palestine, and on Wednesday they are due to play the United Arab Emirates away, but overall the ban remains in place.
The IFA has refused a demand from the Olympic committee to elect a new board.
The javelin has always been Sotherton's weakest discipline but she told BBC WM she has worked hard on improving.
"It's been my Achilles heel for three years but I've still managed to win six medals out of eight.
The current Commonwealth champion is among the favourites to win her first gold medal at World and Olympic level in Beijing in August, following the withdrawal of defending Olympic champion Carolina Kluft.
Sotherton continued her build up for Beijing by running in the 4x400m relay at the European Cup in France.
"I ran really well, better than I thought I'd run and better than my coach thought, so I'm in good shape," she said.
"I just need to get the technical events right but my attitude to it [the javelin] is not so negative.
South Africa's Education Minister Kadar Asmal said that British recruiters are "raiding" the country's resources at a crucial time in the nation's development.
South African teaching unions have said that they understand the desire of many to go abroad as there are better salaries and better working conditions on offer.
Mr Asmal said he had no problem with individual teachers working abroad, but argued that "consultation between the two governments would ensure that the interests of both countries could be taken into account".
There are no official statistics about the number of teachers who have left South Africa, but estimates put the figure at about 8000.
The British agency recruiting in South Africa has said that there is a surplus of teachers in the country, so they are not acting against South Afriica's interests.
Mr Asmal's statement comes ahead of a visit to South Africa by four British headteachers who will be interviewing 200 teachers for vacancies in the UK.
The "brain drain" has not only had an impact on South Africa's teaching profession, the country has also lost a large number of doctors and nurses.
Riots leave many dead in China
Several hundred people were arrested after a protest, in the city of Urumqi on Sunday, turned violent.
Beijing says Uighurs went on the rampage but one exiled Uighur leader says police fired on students.
The protest was reportedly prompted by a deadly fight between Uighurs and Han Chinese in southern China last month.
The BBC's Chris Hogg says the violence is some of the worst reported in the country since Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Eyewitnesses said the violence started on Sunday in Urumqi after a protest of a few hundred people grew to more than 1,000.
Xinhua says the protesters carried knives, bricks and batons, smashed cars and stores, and fought with security forces.
Wu Nong, news director for the Xinjiang government, said more than 260 vehicles were attacked and more than 200 shops and houses damaged.
Most of the violence is reported to have taken place in the city centre, around Renmin (People's) Square, Jiefang and Xinhua South Roads and the Bazaar.
The police presence was reported to be heavy on Monday.
A witness in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar told AP there was a protest there on Monday of about 300 people but there were no clashes with police.
It is still unclear who died in Urumqi and why so many were killed.
The Xinjiang government blamed separatist Uighurs based abroad for orchestrating attacks on ethnic Han Chinese.
But Uighur groups insisted their protest was peaceful and had fallen victim to state violence, with police firing indiscriminately on protesters in Urumqi.
Dolkun Isa, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) in Munich, disputed the official figures, saying the protest was 10,000 strong and that 600 people were killed.
He rejected reports on Xinhua that it had instigated the protests.
Xinhua had quoted the Xinjiang government as blaming WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer for "masterminding" the violence.
But Mr Isa said the WUC had called on Friday only for protests at Chinese embassies around the world.
Alim Seytoff, the vice-president of another Uighur group - the US-based Uighur American Association - condemned the "heavy-handed" actions of the security forces.
When asked about the rioting, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that all governments must protect freedom of speech and "the life and safety of civilian populations".
A spokesman for UK PM Gordon Brown said Britain was urging "restraint on all sides".
Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said he had raised the issue of human rights with visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao in Rome.
The Uighurs in Urumqi were reportedly angry over an ethnic clash last month in the city of Shaoguan in southern Guangdong province.
A man there was said to have posted a message on a local website claiming six boys from Xinjiang had "raped two innocent girls".
BBC sources in China report they have been unable to open the Twitter messaging site in Shanghai and that message boards on Xinjiang on a number of websites were not taking posts.
Reports from Xinjiang suggest some internet and mobile phone services have been blocked.
Analysts say the government's so-called Great Firewall of China, which it uses to block unwanted internet material, will prevent large-scale dissemination of information but that dedicated internet users can bypass it fairly easily.
BBC China editor Shirong Chen says there has been ethnic tension in Xinjiang since before the founding of the People's Republic.
Some of its Uighur population of about eight million want to break away from China and its majority Han Chinese population.
The authorities say police are securing order across the region and anyone creating a disturbance will be detained and punished.
However, our China editor says there may be questions asked about their inability to prevent a protest they knew about days in advance.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said the fall continued despite a rise in online and mobile music store revenues.
Record company bosses are meeting at the Midem conference in Cannes, France.
The event, which is taking place this week, has seen registration from 9,500 participants from 92 countries and is the music industry's largest European gathering.
Figures for the new downturn are based on data from three-quarters of the global market.
The overall sales decline came despite a threefold increase in digital music revenue, while illegal file-sharing volumes changed little, according to a separate IFPI market report published on Thursday.
And the body believes sales will remain broadly unchanged in 2006.
Executives are now having to look beyond piracy to explain the latest decline in revenues, which have fallen by around 20% globally since 1999.
Speaking at the MidemNet music technology forum, which preceded the main event, Mr Nicoli also cited tougher competition from other categories of consumer goods.
A number of record companies are also pressing Apple to allow more pricing flexibility on its iTunes Music Store, which currently charges the same rate for any song downloaded.
They have argued, so far without success, that they should be able to charge more for the most sought-after hits.
Apple's iTunes accounts for around 70% of US and British online music sales and has significant shares of its 19 other markets.
This popularity is widely credited with halting the growth of piracy, but record companies complain that the cost to them has been a loss of control over their own pricing and marketing.
The BSC received 12 complaints from viewers about the use of death as entertainment in LWT's Aircraft Emergencies.
Upholding the complaints, the BSC decided the documentary had shown a lack of respect for the victims involved.
"The repeated use of footage of air crashes which had resulted in injury and death, coupled with the dramatic nature of its presentation by the use of music and slow motion, combined to leave the viewer as voyeur," said the BSC in its monthly report.
In its defence, LWT argued that much of the footage had been seen before and did not show close-ups of the crashes or victims.
But in its report, the BSC also pointed out that several of the complainants knew people involved in the crashes which "could have only added to their distress".
Also criticised in the commission's report was a trailer for a late night wrestling match on Channel 4.
The trailers went out before the watershed and the BSC said children might have therefore been mislead into watching the show.
Further complaints about the BBC's Modern Times programme about Moors Murderer Myra Hindley were dismissed.
The programme was based on letters written by Hindley and one viewer thought the coverage was offensive.
The BSC thought the programme covered an issue of legitimate public concern.
Vasily Bukhtienko was attacked by three men on a tennis court in Volgograd (formerly known as Stalingrad), in southern Russia, officials said
They say the men used electric shock devices and then repeatedly hit Mr Bukhtienko on the head.
In 2005, Mr Bukhtienko founded a Stalin museum near an imposing monument commemorating the 1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad, which is considered by many historians as a turning point in World War II.
The University of Athens Medical School team monitored 1,150 Greek people for 15 years.
The Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found fewer deaths in total, and particularly from heart disease, among those in the highlands.
But British experts warned high altitudes could be dangerous for people who already had heart disease.
Residents of Arahova, in the mountainous Sterea Hellas region (950m above sea level), and Zevgolatio and Aidonia in the plains of the Peloponnesus region took part in a general health survey in 1981.
Men in the villages made their living by farming and keeping animals, while the women tended to look after the home and family.
In Greece, deaths from heart disease are among the lowest of any developed country, a factor which could be largely due to the Mediterranean diet most people eat.
Both men and women living in the mountain village appeared to be at higher risk of coronary heart disease than people living in the lowland area, with higher rates of circulating blood fats and higher blood pressure.
However, by 1996, there had been a total of 133 deaths among the 566 people living in the mountains, and 157 deaths among those living on the plains.
Coronary heart disease caused the deaths of 11 men in the highland and 23 in lowland areas, and 16 among women in the highlands compared to 17 in the lowlands.
The researchers, led by Dr Nikis Baibas, said that since blood fats and blood pressure were higher among the mountain residents, "other 'protective' factors", especially among men, must come into play
Writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, they said living at moderately high altitude produced long term physiological changes in the body to enable it to cope with lower levels of oxygen (hypoxia), and that this, combined with the exertion required to walk uphill regularly on rugged terrain, could give the heart a better work-out.
But Belinda Linden, Head of Medical Information at the British Heart Foundation, said the Greek researchers had not taken activity levels into account as part of the study.
"Activity at high altitude can cause exertion to be more difficult, due to the shortage of oxygen.
Home Office minister Nick Herbert defends the coalition government's decision to push ahead with gay marriage despite it having not been on either party's election manifesto.
The reforms are being phased in over the next three years but many farmers and crofters fear they could lose their livelihoods.
Rural Affairs Minister Ross Finnie said he has accepted that the situation is bad, but has rejected criticism that he did not consult with farmers.
He said Scottish officials tried hard to get Europe to recognise the particular difficulties of farming in Scotland.
About 83% of Scotland's agricultural land qualifies for Less Favoured Area status.
This is a European Union scheme designed to support farmers in the most difficult conditions.
Historically, farmers were paid a subsidy on a "per animal" basis.
However, as part of wide-ranging reforms to the system this is being changed to an acreage system where they are paid by area.
Acreage is said to favour larger landowners and could result in unused land effectively raking in money.
The Scottish Executive had to come up with schemes that would be acceptable within EU guidelines.
The executive scheme divides Scotland into very broad areas and offers subsidy rates for improved pasture or rough grazing.
The payments will gradually decrease over the next three years.
"Not the overall philosophy behind what Europe is trying to achieve, but the way it has been implemented on the ground by the department officials.
"I know that Ross Finnie has tried to reassure people by saying that the most that people would lose in the first year would be something like 10%.
Scottish Tory rural affairs spokesman Alex Johnstone said that, although the rural affairs department had consulted with the National Farmers' Union, there had been a failure to speak to other groups like the Scottish Landowners Federation and the Crofters Union.
However, Mr Finnie rejected the accusations.
He said a scheme put forward by the rural affairs department which had six differentials of support was rejected by Europe.
Mandaric, who took over the ailing First Division club five seasons ago, promised to return Portsmouth to the big time.
And Pompey ended their 15-year absence from English football's top flight with a nervy victory over Burnley at Fratton Park on Tuesday evening.
Now his mission is complete, Mandaric revealed he would take time to consider whether to stay on as chairman of the Premiership-bound side.
The charismatic Serb had stated earlier in the season that he would review his position in April once he had resolved business and family commitments in the United States.
"My excitement is delivering this kind of reward to people who deserve it and those are the faithful supporters," Mandaric said of Portsmouth's promotion.
"It's great to be the chairman of a Premiership club but my goal has been to deliver the dream to the people of Portsmouth.
"I haven't made a decision about my future yet.
"I need a few weeks to sort things out back in America but hopefully, as far as I am concerned, I do want to stay with the club.
"But our goal really is to stay in the Premiership and get the 40 points we need to stay up.
However, one thing Mandaric has definitely set his sights on is delivering a silver lining to the club's promotion - by winning the Division One title.
While manager Harry Redknapp has masterminded Portsmouth's heady rise to the top of the table, Mandaric has invested millions of pounds to get Pompey promoted.
"I am happy for all us of here in Portsmouth," Mandaric added.
"We have played good football, Harry has done a tremendous job and the players have made us very proud.
Lance Armstrong's third successive Tour de France victory has put him alongside the event's great cyclists.
The American is only the fifth man to win a hat-trick of Tours.
But four men have five to their name, and at the top of that list is Miguel Indurain.
"Big Mig" and Armstrong were 27 when they won their first Tour and each set standards for their peloton peers.
Many suspect that Indurain rode into the record books without sustained opposition.
Each victory came against a different runner-up - riders like Claudio Chiappucci, Gianni Bugno and Tony Rominger.
But the inescapable fact remains that Indurain recorded the greatest feat in the history of the Tour.
Armstrong has arguably faced better riders but records are records and the Spaniard has set the standard here.
Even during his post-cancer Tour-winning era he has posted two second places in Holland's tough one-day Amstel Gold Classic.
Meanwhile Indurain twice did the double of winning Tour de France and Giro d'Italia in the same year.
That represents six weeks of hard work and does not leave much time for Classics.
However he did become an Olympic champion in the 1996 time trial, and could have surely won elsewhere if he had not retired then.
In contrast Armstrong attacks whenever the opportunity is presented, and his three mountain stage wins represent domination that is never dull.
But the American has still not won over the French press and public who remain unsure of the outsider who recovered from cancer.
Indurain was the king in more innocent days when doping was not such an issue.
But, leaving that aside, in football terms Armstrong is like Brazil 1970 with Indurain playing George Graham's Arsenal.
Indurain's pre-Tour preparation was focused on "match-fitness" and twice he won the yellow jersey on the back of wins in the Giro d'Italia.
His challengers thought they were in with a chance in 1994 when "Big Mig" lost the Giro but he still went on and dominated.
But Armstrong is now setting new standards here, arguably revolutionising the sport as other riders follow his lead.
Armstrong has also dominated here but if the pair were to go head to head off the ramp, Armstrong would have to make do with an unaccustomed second place.
But when his run finally came to an end in 1996, at the hands of Denmark's Bjarne Riis, it was the mountains that proved his downfall.
Indurain's relatively weaker climbing was a weakness that Armstrong would undoubtedly prey on much as he does now with Jan Ullrich.
His change in attitude has added a ruthless streak and in 2001 the American came back from a deficit of over 30 minutes to claim victory in the Tour.
When Indurain faced his toughest challenge in the Tour in 1996 he cracked and, despite winning Olympic gold in Atlanta, retired from cycling.
Fry said the chances of a sale were "very positive", boosting the racing team's prospects of making the grid for the new season.
"We had, as you might expect, a huge amount of interest at the start - probably well in excess of 30 groups came to us," said Fry.
The Japanese manufacturer pulled out of Formula One last month, blaming the global financial crisis for their decision.
"Right at the start of this process (Formula One boss) Bernie Ecclestone said that he was 100% confident that we'd be on the grid in Melbourne, and I have to say that I wasn't quite so sure where his confidence came from," said Fry.
Fry said Honda were a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for potential buyers thanks to the investment in staff and cars the team had made.
"We've got a team that has benefited from �75m worth of capital investment in the last three years," he added.
Fry said a consideration in any sale would be to ensure a long-term future for the staff at the Brackley-based racing team.
"Neither Ross nor I want to stand there again and say that everything is fine if in one or two years' time we fall flat on our face again," he added.
Georg Hackl came to the Games attempting to become the first Winter Olympian to win four consecutive golds in the same individual event.
However, for Hackl there was a silver lining.
He returns to Bavaria as the only Olympian, summer or winter, to have won a medal in the same individual event at five consecutive Games.
"Statistically it might have been nice to win the gold and make history, but I care more about the actual racing than history," the ever-professional Hackl said.
It was a classic scam in which building companies paid under-the-counter commissions in order to win bids to renovate schools in the Paris region.
So far - in the grubby world of late 20th-Century French politics - so normal.
But what set the "Paris lycees affair" apart from the rest of the pack was the destination of the illegal money.
Rather than going solely into the coffers of Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic (RPR) party via the capital's city hall, the funds were divvied up.
Years later, when the case came to court, the heads that rolled were from both left and right.
The notion that illegal party funding was the exclusive preserve of Mr Chirac and his cronies was shown to be a naive simplification.
To this extent, the former president is surely right to plead - as he does now - that any judgment on the dubious practices of the 1980s and 1990s must take into account the context of the time.
In an article in Le Monde, he explains how originally no law existed governing the funding of political parties.
As a result, it became the custom accepted by the left and the right to raise money from "private firms and even public budgets".
This had not mattered when parties' costs were low, but they sky-rocketed in the 1980s with the growing importance of communications and the creation of European and regional elections.
Not until 1995 was a law finally passed establishing public financing of political parties and banning company donations.
After all, scores of people have been disgraced by the courts in France's party funding trials.
They include several of Mr Chirac's own close associates, such as former Prime Minister Alain Juppe whose political career was wrecked by his conviction in 2004.
Opposition leaders like Henri Emmanuelli of the Socialists have also taken the rap.
The fact that the illegal practices were widespread was no excuse for them, so why should it be for Mr Chirac - especially as 80% of the public now say he should be treated as a citizen like any other?
If there is a difference between his and other cases, it is not the lack of evidence - his article in Le Monde was a tacit admission he knew what was going on - but more simply, the passage of time.
Thankfully, France has moved on from the disturbing days of a decade ago, when news bulletins were dominated by fresh revelations of political corruption.
That is why French people have a conflict of feelings on what to do with their former leader.
Previous research has shown that drinking wine in sensible amounts may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.
But the new research suggests that it might also be an effective way to reduce the risk for people who have already had one heart attack.
French researchers found that middle-aged men who had had one heart attack and who drank two or more glasses of wine regularly were 50% less likely than non-drinkers to have a second attack.
Dr Michel de Lorgeril, of the Joseph Fourier University ofGrenoble, France, and colleagues studied 353 men aged 40 to 60 who had just had heart attacks.
Between them, the men had 104 cardiovascular complications such as a heart attack or stroke over the next year.
Thirty-six of the complications occurred among men whoabstained from alcohol, 34 among men who drank fewer than two glasses of wine a day, 18 among those who drank about two glasses a day, and 16 among men who drank an average of four to five glasses of wine a day.
The researchers stressed that more studies are needed tobetter define what type of patients would most benefit frommoderate drinking after a heart attack.
The American Heart Association recommends drinking only moderately and advises anyone who does not drink against starting to do so.
Last year the AHA published guidance to doctors advising them not to prescribe red wine as a way to ward off heart attacks.
US doctors have been advised not to tell their patients that drinking red wine is an effective way to ward off heart attacks.
It said the protective benefits of red wine remain uncertain, and that doctors should concentrate on promoting more proven methods to reduce risk.
The research is published in the journal Circulation.
The technology could have wide applications in wound healing, counter-terrorism and screening patients for MRSA infection.
The team at Sheffield University are developing a portable kit in which specially designed molecules emit a light signal when bound to bacteria.
Current laboratory-based detection of bacteria can take hours or even days.
The team have spent five years designing special large molecules, or polymers, which can bind to cells.
Once bound the polymer changes shape and emits a light signal.
This can either be a coloured light, such as a red glow, or a light that is invisible to the naked eye but can be detected under a fluorescent lamp, depending on the type of polymer that is used.
With funding from the Ministry of Defence, the researchers are now developing polymers which can attach to bacterial cells.
Putting the polymers into a wound would show doctors whether there was a bacterial infection by the presence of a light signal.
The technology would be particularly useful in a war-zone where laboratory facilities are not readily available, said the researchers.
The kit, which could be available in three years, could also be used to detect deliberate release of bacteria, for example in an anthrax attack.
Professor Sheila MacNeil, professor of cell and tissue engineering and one of the project leaders, said current methods of taking a swab and sending it off to a laboratory could take days.
But with a light signal you would get "an instant read-out within a minute".
Professor Peter Hawkey, professor of public health bacteriology at Birmingham University, said more rapid tests to detect bacteria would be widely useful.
He is carrying out work for the Department of Health to develop tests that can be used outside a laboratory, for example in a hospital ward, using a technique which amplifies and detects bacterial DNA.
He added it could be particularly good for detecting one pathogen, such as anthrax.
"It's use could also be in screening for MRSA," he said.
Scientists were surprised to find the same species of "swimming snails" at both poles, raising questions about how they evolved and became so dispersed.
The census, involving 500 researchers from more than 25 nations, was carried out during International Polar Year.
The findings form part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) report, which will be published in 2010.
"Some of the more obvious species like birds and whales migrate between the poles on an annual basis," explained Ron O'Dor, CoML's co-senior scientist.
But he added the presence of smaller creatures, such as worms living in mud, sea cucumbers and "swimming snails", at both locations had particularly interested researchers on the project.
Dr O'Dor said that although there was 12,000km separating the two habitats, it did not create a huge barrier for marine wildlife, as a mountain range does for terrestrial species.
He also added that the temperature differences in the oceans did not vary enough to act as a thermal barrier.
"The deep ocean at the poles falls as low as -1C (30F), but the deep ocean at the equator might not get above 4C (39F).
Dr O'Dor said that part of the CoML's work included examining organisms' genetic information, which would help the scientists to identify any differences between the seemingly identical species.
"The traditional approach was to describe an organism's physical features, so if these organisms lived in very similar habitats, did very similar jobs and ate similar food, then they often looked very alike even if they came from different origins.
The project aims to develop DNA barcoding as a global standard for identifying species using key genetic markers - much like a shop barcode uniquely identifies a retail product.
"It's a new way to mark or classify things," Dr O'Dor observed.
COML, which began back in 2000, carried out 17 regional censuses involving more than 2,000 scientists from 82 nations.
Currently, the census teams are collating and examining the data collected by the various surveys, ahead of the publication in October 2010 of the first global Census of Marine Life.
A report by the Commons public accounts committee says the Building Schools for the Future programme had created expectations it could not meet.
The government has pledged to refurbish or rebuild all 3,500 secondary schools.
Schools Minister Vernon Coaker said the MPs' facts were out of date and the scheme was now accelerating.
According to the committee of MPs, "the department was over-optimistic in its original planning assumptions for BSF, creating expectations for the speed of delivery that could not be met".
Of the 200 schools originally planned to be completed by December 2008, only 42 actually had been.
The department had hoped to deliver the programme over 10-15 years, but now expects it to take 18 years, with the last school completed in 2023.
This is not disputed by the government, but minister Vernon Coaker pointed out that the committee's statistics were out of date.
Since December last year - the end of the period considered by the committee - the number of schools where work had been completed had almost doubled to 78.
A further 115 were due to be finished in this financial year and the 200th school should be completed in the middle of next year, he said.
Centralising the management of the programme had had benefits, he said.
But the department and Partnership for Schools (PfS) - the body set up to manage the programme - must dispel the "air of complacency" which surrounded them.
They should indicate in detail how they proposed to speed up the pace of delivery and finish the programme on time.
"The private sector has voted with its feet and is backing BSF despite the current downturn, with 20 financial institutions in the market and four PfI agreements closing already this year.
The government estimates the whole scheme should cost up to £55bn.
PfS chief executive Tim Byles said the new report was like "looking at BSF through the rear view mirror, based on evidence gathered back in 2008" and the group's planning suggested the "vast majority of projects" would be completed by 2020, assuming continued levels of investment.
"In 2005, new targets were set and since then BSF has met or exceeded the target for schools openings.
Joe Wurzelbacher, of Ohio, was thrown into the spotlight after he was used by John McCain as an example of who might suffer under Barack Obama's tax plans.
But it now emerges he is not a licensed plumber and owes $1,200 in back taxes.
Meanwhile, the two candidates traded jokes, not jibes, at a dinner a day after their final televised debate.
Mr Obama and Mr McCain took to the stage in New York trading wisecracks about their campaigns, in light relief to the tense atmosphere of the debate the night before.
Mr Obama retains a five-point lead over his Republican rival following Wednesday's third and final debate, according to the latest poll by Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby on Friday.
And the Washington Post newspaper has endorsed Barack Obama, saying he has shown the right characteristics needed to take the country through a time of great economic uncertainty.
Joe Wurzelbacher, 34, found himself at the centre of a media frenzy on Thursday after "Joe the plumber" was mentioned 26 times during the final debate.
The meeting between Joe the plumber and Barack Obama
A week earlier, he had confronted Mr Obama at a rally, questioning the Democratic candidate on tax plans that would see him taxed more if a plumbing business he hoped to buy earned more than $250,000 a year.
He was held by Mr McCain in the debate as an example of an every day hard-working American who would be penalised by Mr Obama's tax policy.
However, a bit of media digging has uncovered that Mr Wurzelbacher's first name is actually Samuel and he does not have a plumber's licence, although the company he works for does.
According to Tony Herrera, of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 50 in Toledo, Ohio, Mr Wurzelbacher cannot practise in Toledo without a licence - although he can work for someone with a master's licence or in outlying areas that do not require a licence.
Mr Wurzelbacher acknowledged he did not have a plumber's licence and admitted in one interview he was "not even close" to earning $250,000.
US rivals swap jokes at dinner
He also made a jokey reference to Barack Obama's fierce rival for the Democratic candidacy, Hillary Clinton, who was also in the audience.
Meanwhile, Barack Obama said he needed to correct some misconceptions about his background.
He also listed his great strength as "my humility" and his greatest weakness as being "a little too awesome".
The annual dinner has a tradition of presidential candidates as headline speakers before the election.
Both men paid tribute to each other, with Mr Obama praising Mr McCain's service to his country as a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam.
One Xinhua report said the protesters were carrying banners asking for "an improvement to people's livelihoods, the release of prisoners and national reconciliation", but did not mention their demands for democratic reform.
Almost all newspaper websites in China have carried low profile, factual reports on Burma.
The paper added that the Rangoon government had received increased support from Russia, "which is allegedly helping it realise its nuclear ambitions by building facilities in Burma, in addition to training Burmese officials in Moscow".
Fiat still wants to buy GM Europe, but it said German government requests for extra funding were "unreasonable".
There is now some doubt as to whether the meeting will go ahead as continuing talks between GM and rival bidder Magna are proving to be difficult.
GM in the US is expected to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday.
There is a danger that GM Europe could also be declared insolvent if its future is not secured by then.
The German government had hoped to reach a decision on Wednesday, but said it needed more information from the US after GM asked for extra cash.
The sale of GM Europe is a key part of the troubled American car group's plans to restructure its business.
The US investor Ripplewood Holdings pulled out of the race on Wednesday night.
There was also a last-minute expression of interest from Beijing Automotive Industry Corp (BAIC), but German officials said they did not yet have enough information on BAIC's offer.
Now, Fiat has said it is unreasonable for the German government to ask Fiat to provide emergency funding to Opel, while it decided on the timing and conditions of its own bridge financing.
Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne said that would expose his company to "unnecessary and unwarranted risks" because it has not yet been given full access to Opel's books.
On Thursday, the German government criticised the US Treasury and General Motors after being told at the last minute that that GM Europe would need another 300m euros ($415m; £260m) in short-term funding.
European Union industry ministers will meet in Brussels on Friday to discuss GM Europe, a meeting called after some countries with GM plants said that Germany was having too much say over the future of the company.
But Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the German economy minister, dismissed suggestions he was putting German jobs first, saying he had the wider interests of Europe at heart.
While GM Europe is a big employer in Germany, the UK, home of GM's Vauxhall brand, is another big employer with 5,500 jobs at stake.
Meanwhile, the GM parent company in Detroit is moving closer to bankruptcy protection backed by the US Treasury.
The board of the carmaker will meet on Friday to prepare to file for bankruptcy in New York on Monday, in what would be the biggest bankruptcy of a US company.
In return, the US government would provide $30bn in additional financing to keep the new GM operating under bankruptcy protection.
GM bondholders, who hold $27bn of GM debt, are being offered the option to buy an extra 15%, on top of the 10% they had previously been offered.
The research findings show that many young women are so concerned about their appearance that they will not go naked in front of their partners, refuse to leave the house, and indulge in damaging eating binges.
The study suggests social and peer group pressure has given women a distorted perception of what is a healthy weight, and the belief that unless they have a waif-like figure they will be rejected by men and get turned down for jobs.
The survey was conducted for the Bread for Life campaign which is funded by the Flour Advisory Bureau to encourage young women to eat a more healthy diet, including more bread.
Denise Van Outen, the TV presenter who fronts the Bread for Life campaign, says many of the findings strike a chord with her.
Dr Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel, has dedicated his life to tracking down and prosecuting those responsible for the atrocities of World War II.
He told HARDtalk the task of bringing Nazi criminals to justice is often frustrating but he believes it is an obligation to the victims of the Holocaust to keep trying.
The drugs, cash and a charity box were were stolen from Pet Doctors in Manor Road, Tongham, during a break-in overnight on 31 December.
The haul included Valium, ketamine, Domitor and pethidine.
Surrey Police warned that the drugs could be very dangerous in the wrong hands and appealed to the public to help trace them.

It is understood that the pair have been banned for the rest of the year for disciplinary reasons.
However, in a statement the players claim they were not "engaged in any form of unruly conduct".
They will be replaced by Damien Diver and Barry Monaghan for the Breffni Park decider against Louth.
Donegal chairman Charlie O'Donnell said that the county executive fully backed manager Brian McIver's move.
Cassidy was outstanding in the semi-final win over Westmeath and both he and McGee will be major losses.
It's the second occasion that McGee has been dropped from the panel for disciplinary reasons as he axed from the squad in July 2004.
On that occasion, both he and Brian McLaughlin were dropped by then boss Brian McEniff after they allegedly turned up for training in an unfit condition two days after the Ulster final hammering by Armagh.
Two years earlier, a number of Donegal players misbehaved after the All-Ireland Quarter-Final draw against Dublin and the team were hammered in the subsequent replay.
There have also been a number of other disciplinary problems which have affected the squad in recent years.
McIver, himself, said that there "certainly was an issue which arose during this week" but added that disciplinary issues are "handled internally".
"Nobody at any particular stage wants anything to take away your focus so it is going to be very important for us to get our focus right because, Louth are going to provide us with an unbelievable challenge," added McIver.
To make matters worse for Sunday's game, McIver is likely to be without defender Karl Lacey who sustained a hamstring injury while playing for his club Four Masters on Monday.
Scan results have not yet been received but Donegal officials fear that he will miss Sunday's decider.
On the plus side, Barry Monaghan and Rory Kavanagh are expected to be fit after missing last Sunday's two-point victory over Westmeath.
Meanwhile, Louth boss Eamonn McEneaney has named an unchanged team for Sunday's game.
The Louth team's big name players are Mark Stanfield, JP Rooney and Aaron Hoey.
The I-Fairy conducts the wedding for the happy couple
The automated creature, known as the I-Fairy, oversaw the wedding of Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue in the capital, Tokyo.
The couple decided to use the robot as they are both connected with Japan's thriving robotics industry.
Since robots had brought them together in the first place, they said, having one officiate at their wedding was a natural choice.
During the ceremony, I-Fairy - which has flashing eyes and plastic pigtails - instructed the groom to lift the bride's veil for the kiss.
The wedding took part in a rooftop restaurant in the Japanese capital.
A spokesman said an e-mail sent to fans claiming they had scrapped the Buenos Aires concert due to high demand for their other dates was "fake".
The Spice Girls are due to play in the South American city as part of their reunion world tour.
They hope to schedule the gig for a date in February, the spokesman added.
Dates in Cape Town, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Sydney are also still to be finalised, according to the band's website.
"The e-mail goes onto say that they will be running some competitions for their South American fans to travel to the UK to watch a show.
The Spice Girls will kick off their world tour on 2 December in Vancouver, moving on to San Jose, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago and Boston; then across the Atlantic to play Manchester and 17 nights at the O2, in London.
At the end of January their tour takes them back to North America for gigs in Boston, Toronto and New York.
The artist, famed for his nude landscapes, will create his next installation against the backdrop of Eastnor Castle Deer Park.
US singer Kelis and rapper Roots Manuva are also on the bill.
Volunteers will receive a limited edition print of the installation.
Tunick, whose work has been staged in Dublin, New York, Barcelona and at the Sydney Opera House, enlists ordinary members of the public in his projects, putting them at the heart of his artwork.
He recently launched a recruitment drive for 1,000 volunteers to celebrate the 10th birthday of The Lowry art gallery in Salford.
His latest collaboration is part of The Big Chill's ongoing visual arts programme Art Trail.
The review, for the UK Treasury, scrutinised financial supervision, transparency and taxation in Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.
Michael Foot, a former official at the UK Treasury, praised high regulation standards in Guernsey and Jersey.
He added that crown dependencies needed to increase security for depositors.
The review began in Autumn 2008.
The report recommends that jurisdictions ensure depositor protection schemes are clear to understand and states that Guernsey and Jersey, unlike the Isle of Man, both lack an Ombudsman scheme and should consider one.
The report acknowledged the work of the Channel Islands to meet the OECD standards for tax transparency and in negotiating high numbers of tax information exchange agreements with other jurisdictions.
The recommendation that the UK leads a drive to ensure all EU member states and third countries automatically share tax information was welcomed by Senator Terry Le Sueur, Jersey's chief minister.
Deputy Lyndon Trott, Guernsey's chief minister, said Guernsey had a good message to tell, although he also admitted that the island could not be complacent.
Deputy Trott said it did refer to further work to be undertaken including preparing for further economic downfalls and whether an ombudsman scheme would be justified, but this was all work that the States had already begun.
He added he hopes the report will help dispel some of the myths surrounding the financial services sector.
Rather than spreading out in conventional fashion, it veered off in various, complex directions.
Karen's current partner, Craig Meehan, is the father of her youngest child.
It is his uncle - Michael Donovan - who has been charged with the kidnap and false imprisonment of Shannon.
When she disappeared last month, Shannon was living with Karen and Craig in Dewsbury Moor along with three other children.
Shannon's real father is Leon Rose, who lives 10 miles away in Huddersfield.
When Karen and Leon were together, they had two children - Shannon and her older brother, who now lives with his father in Huddersfield.
Of Karen's seven children, four live with her and three - two boys and a girl - live elsewhere.
During the course of the police investigation into the disappearance of Shannon, they looked at all of her family connections.
At the same time, they searched 3,000 houses in the Dewsbury area and spoke to 6,000 different people.
Although Shannon's father, Leon, did not see much of her during the months before she disappeared, he stood side-by-side with Karen and Craig during one of the community events to highlight the search for the missing schoolgirl.
And when step-father Craig was criticised by some members of Karen's family, Leon defended him.
As well as highlighting the divisions in the family, the search for Shannon brought some relatives closer together.
Ecologists made the find after examining 20 sites along the River Lee, in east London, and Bow Back Rivers.
The sites have been earmarked for an 80,000-seat Olympic stadium, arenas, and a water sports centre.
The ecologists were conducting a study to assess the potential impact of development along the lower reaches of the River Lee.
Almost 2,000 small worms, also known as the oligochaeta annelid, were discovered in the Walthamstow Marshes and Springfield Marina.
They are usually only found in limited parts of France, Belgium and Holland and have never been recorded in the UK before.
Groups of endangered German hairy snails, or perforatella rubiginosa, were also found in reed beds on the Channelsea River in West Ham.
There are thought to be about two million of the snails, which measure just 5mm across, in the area.
Although neither species are legally protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, the agency said local authorities must consider any impact on such species when ruling on planning applications.
A year after a near-�1m project was awarded to digitise modern Welsh writing, a dispute between authors and the library has not been resolved.
But literature promotion agency Academi wants writers to be paid a share.
"Everybody else in the whole process is getting paid but the writers don't.
The library has said an offer to take down from its live site material by writers who object is a "reasonable compromise".
Wales' former national poet, Gwyneth Lewis said the issue was a matter of principle.
However, some writers are happy for their works to be digitised without a payment.
Writer and publisher Lewis Davies, whose 1993 book Work, Sex and Rugby was voted the best book to describe Wales in the World Book Day campaign in 2003, is in favour.
The library has been asked to comment.
The Liverpudlian lass has a throat problem called bronchitis and her doctor's ordered her to rest.
She's got to take it easy for at least five days or she could risk damaging her voice forever.
The girls are also due to appear at the Box Live gigs in London and Birmingham at the end of May.
"He has a three-and-a-half-year contract with Manchester City and we are not thinking anything other than that," Marwood told BBC Sport.
Tevez, 26, requested a transfer from City, claiming his relationship with "certain executives" was irreparable.
City representatives met with Tevez on Friday to try and persuade him to stay.
Manager Roberto Mancini was among those representatives who met the Argentine.
Speaking before that meeting the former Lazio player said he hoped his captain would be convinced to stay at the club before taking to the field against Everton on Monday evening.
"Will he play on Monday? Yes - he has trained since Tuesday, and he doesn't have a problem," Mancini said.
City's football administrator Marwood denied Tevez's public rift with the club might damage either his or his team-mates' form.
"I can reassure everyone that his mind has been fine this week," he said.
"He has trained fantastically well, he has integrated back into the group after having a few days off.
"I do not think anyone at our football club has any worries about his state of mind.
Tevez was not in the party that travelled to Italy for Thursday's 1-1 Europa League draw with Juventus, with Mancini instead giving a number of fringe players a run out with qualification to the last 32 already assured.
Tevez situation will not affect team - Platt
The squad were due to fly back on Thursday evening but were forced to spend the night in Turin after the plane developed a technical fault.
But despite the delay, the club's first-team coach David Platt said that talks with Tevez would be a priority on their return.
Tevez has stated that he will continue to play for the club until any transfer is agreed, but speaking on Wednesday Mancini added he still believed the player could stay in the long term.
I want to talk to Tevez - Mancini
Marwood suggested that some of the figures surrounding Tevez, who is advised by Iranian Kia Joorabchian, may be agitating for a move.
"Sometimes there are other influences at work that have other agendas, but we have not engaged in any commentary through the week," said Marwood.
Joorabchian, who claims to have tried to talk Tevez into staying, has said that the striker's desire to leave stems in part from City's failure to qualify for this season's Champions League.
Tevez joined City in 2009 following a two-year spell with rivals Manchester United.
He scored 29 goals in his debut season and has managed 10 in 18 appearances since Mancini handed him the captaincy prior to the start of the current campaign.
But less than 17 months into a five-year contract, the former Boca Juniors, Corinthians and West Ham forward asked to leave.
The Brazilian sealed his move from Dutch club Heerenveen on transfer deadline day last Thursday.
The 27-year-old missed his side's draw at Newcastle on Sunday because his final working permit had not arrived from the British Embassy in Holland.
But the relevant paperwork has now been processed, leaving Alves free to train.
The Brazil international striker could now make his Middlesbrough debut at home to Fulham on Saturday.
Southgate had been called into reassuring fans that the club would not lose their new signing to a legal challenge.
Dutch club AZ Alkmaar claimed they have a pre-contract agreement with Alves.
Alkmaar say they will take their case to Fifa, despite the Dutch FA already ruling that the agreement is invalid.
Former Argentine army commander General Martin Balza was detained earlier by a federal judge after being accused of organising the sale of weapons and munitions to Croatia and Ecuador in the early 1990s in violation of international embargoes.
The two cases have already led to the arrest of Mr Menem's former defence minister, Erman Gonzalez, and ex-brother-in-law, Emir Yoma.
Mr Menem married Chilean beauty queen, Cecilia Bolocco, on 26 May.
The weapons sales were allegedly carried out through secret decrees authorising sales to Venezuela and Panama - which has no army - which were eventually re-routed to war zones in Croatia and Ecuador.
The federal judge's decision to interrogate Mr Menem follows allegations of his involvement made by a private lawyer.
There are concerns that charges against him could mobilise the opposition at a time of economic difficulty.
Mr Menem's party, the Peronists, still controls the country's Senate.
But a recent opinion poll suggested that more than 60% of Argentines thought Mr Menem was guilty.
However at the moment psychologists are not legally required to be on the register before they can practise in the UK and as a result the BPS is powerless to act against individuals who are not members of the society.
The society can take action against any member who has breached its code of conduct or who has been found guilty of professional misconduct.
A disciplinary committee hears cases in private and considers evidence from witnesses including the psychologist involved.
The committee publishes its decision and can reprimand the individual or strike them off its register throwing them out of the society.
The BPS is pressing the government to introduce legislation requiring all psychologists to be on its register and, thus, open to investigation.
It is responsible for dealing with complaints relating to any of the 120,000 individuals working in these professions.
It can take action against any practitioners who have been found guilty of a criminal offence or any individual who has been found guilty of "infamous conduct in a professional respect".
Under existing law, the only action the CPSM can take against such practitioners is to strike them off its register which aims to prevent them from working in the UK.
The government has put forward plans to replace the CPSM with a new body the Health Professions Council.
Under the plans, the HPC would be given stronger powers to deal with practitioners who fail to meet appropriate standards of work or behaviour.
The change is also aimed at allowing the HPC to regulate other professions who are not currently being regulated.
The GCC, which is run by a 20-member Council, is also responsible for maintaining high standards of education for chiropractors.
It can impose a fine or suspend an individual's registration stopping them from practising in the UK for at least 12 months.
It has been illegal since May 2000 for any individual who is not registered to call themselves an osteopath.
The GOsC is responsible for taking action against any osteopath who is found guilty of unacceptable conduct or professional misconduct, anyone who has been convicted of a criminal offence and anyone whose health problems prevent them from practising properly.
Its code of practise lays down the standards expected of all osteopaths on the register.
Complaints against individual osteopaths are assessed by a screener or investigator who decides whether the case should be referred to the GOsC investigating committee.
This committee re-examines the evidence and decides whether the case should be referred to a public hearing of its professional conduct committee (PCC).
The PCC hears evidence from witnesses and can take action against individuals if it believes the professional misconduct has occurred.
In this instance, it can decide to formally admonish the individual; impose conditions on an their practice; or suspend the from practising for a limited period.
But under government plans all social workers will have to be registered with the GSCC from 2001.
The GSCC will be responsible for drawing up a code of conduct and ensuring that social workers across the UK meet high standards of care and disciplining those that fall below these standards.
The society's statutory committee can take disciplinary action against any individuals who have been convicted of a criminal offence or who have been found guilty of professional misconduct.
It can erase individuals from its register stopping them from practising in the UK and it can also decide whether pharmacy premises can remain registered.
The government is planning to introduce legislation to strengthen regulation of pharmacists.
Under the plans, the Council will be an umbrella body which will oversee the work of all of the health regulatory bodies.
It will be responsible for ensuring formal co-ordination between the various regulatory bodies and will act as a forum for all sectors to share views and ideas.
The Council is expected to work to establish common procedures across the health service for dealing with complaints against practitioners.
The government has indicated that if concerns about the ability of the existing regulatory bodies to protect the public continue, this Council could evolve and take over responsibility for regulating all health practitioners.
Previously, only issues going back to 1950 were accessible on the net.
The pre-1950s Nature archives include seminal moments in science history, from the theory of mechanical flight to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Many discoveries first reported in Nature went on to win Nobel Prizes, particularly in the physical sciences.
Despite the boom in periodical publishing in Victorian Britain in the 1860s, the fledgling Nature did not make a profit for more than 30 years and only survived because of the commitment and belief of its first publisher, Alexander Macmillan, co-founder of Macmillan Publishers, and the hard work of the first editor, Norman Lockyer.
An astrophysicist who discovered the element helium in the Sun's corona decades before it was found on Earth, Lockyer had a forceful personality which led to damaging clashes with many of the leading scientists of the day.
Indeed, some historians of science have suggested that Lockyer even encouraged controversies in the pages of Nature to raise awareness of the journal and boost its readership.
Nature under Lockyer featured numerous articles regarding Charles Darwin's theory of evolution written by heavyweights of Victorian science such as Thomas Henry Huxley, the man known as "Darwin's Bulldog".
After a mammoth editorship lasting 50 years, Lockyer handed over the reins to Richard Gregory, the son of a famous Bristolian street poet; and Gregory's humble upbringing brought a more socially oriented, but no less scientific, perspective to the journal in the years following World War I.
Memorable moments in science under Gregory's editorship included the discovery of the neutron and an entire special issue devoted to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Under their joint stewardship, Nature published seminal papers in palaeoanthropology, a string of papers on nuclear energy, and the discovery of holography and the laser - the latter famously dubbed "a solution looking for a problem".
The "Swinging Sixties" also saw Nature rejuvenated as John Maddox's journalistic zeal brought news to the fore.
During his tenure the modern incarnation of the journal was born, ably continued by later editors David Davies and Philip Campbell.
A new website, History of the Journal Nature, has been launched to coincide with the release of the archives and hosts a multimedia fest which includes video, interactive timelines and specially commissioned essays that examine an aspect of each editorship.
For a journal spanning more than 14 decades, there have been just seven editors of Nature.
"The video interviews give a personal feel to the journal that is otherwise unavailable," says Campbell.
Will the synthesis of C60, a spherical form of carbon that forms the backbone of many developments in nanotechnology (and a personal favourite of Campbell's) triumph over the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer, or perhaps any of Nature's odder publishing moments?
"Print has an appeal, but 50 years from now Nature could be in our brains by means of implants or other types of extension," says Campbell.
Arran Frood was Nature's web projects editor in 2007
Scientists used fossil records stretching back 540 million years to work out the evolution rate at reefs.
They report in the journal Science that new species originate 50% faster in coral reefs than in other habitats.
The team says its findings show that the loss of these evolution hotspots could mean "losing an opportunity to create new species" in the future.
Coral reefs harbour a huge number of marine species - they are often likened to rainforests in terms of their biodiversity.
But they also provide a "pump of new marine species", according to Wolfgang Kiessling the scientist from Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany, who led this study.
He and his colleagues examined the fossil record to find the earliest evidence of benthic creatures - animals that live on the seafloor.
This team of scientists looked for the earliest fossils from each benthic genus, or group of species, in the fossil record.
He and his colleagues had access to a record stretching back to the Cambrian explosion - when the vast majority of complex organisms are believed to have emerged more than 540 million years ago.
This huge data set was compiled by an international project called the Paleobiology Database, which was started in 2000.
But Dr Brian Rosen, a zoologist at the Natural History Museum in London, UK, warned that the accuracy of fossil records alone was "notoriously difficult to gauge from the literature".
He added that it could be useful for independent experts to re-examine some of the fossilised creatures.
Data "generated by direct examination of the specimens themselves by the relevant taxonomic specialists" is more reliable when it comes to working out important evolutionary patterns, he said.
Carl-Gustaf Lundin, head of the marine programme at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said that this was a "very welcome paper".
Charges over the crash against former Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett and two other executives were also dropped.
Mr Justice Mackay at the Royal Courts of Justice ruled there was no evidence to support allegations against them.
Several other former Balfour Beatty executives still face charges over the crash on 17 October 2000, which claimed four lives.
Mr Corbett had been facing charges under the Health and Safety Act.
Manslaughter charges against Charles Pollard, 45, director of the London North Eastern Zone of Railtrack, were quashed.
A Health and Safety charge against Christopher Leah, 55, director of safety and operations at Railtrack, was also dropped.
Speaking outside the court, Mr Pollard said he was "delighted" - but this emotion was tempered by the suffering of the families affected by the crash.
The crash occurred when a GNER express derailed half-a-mile south of Hatfield station in Hertfordshire.
Those who died in the accident were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds; Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford,Nottingham; and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.
The Easter period marks one year since land stabilisation and coast protection work began in Lyme Regis, Dorset.
Hundreds of piles - which pin slipping land to stronger rock - have already been put in place, while landscaping is well under way in Langmoor Gardens.
Tonnes of sand are now to be used to build up the beach and to protect the foreshore from further erosion.
Shingle to build up the beach is due to be delivered later in the spring while work continues to stabilise Lister Gardens and build a new sea wall.
The big freeze meant 623 schools were closed in Wales, as were hundreds in south west England and the Midlands.
Parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland were also hit hard, and weather experts are warning that more snow is expected to fall on Friday.
That's got some local councils worried as they've used so much salt and grit already that they're running out.
Some councils say they only have three days of grit left, and are trying to buy more in from other countries.
Up to 20cm of snow fell in some areas on Thursday, with the West Country, south Midlands and Wales among the worst affected.
Some of the schools that were closed will be open again on Friday, but if you're not sure about yours yet the advice is to keep an eye on local news.
Meanwhile, Thursday's snowfall is causing widespread disruption - the runway at Luton airport has been closed and loads of trains and buses in some of the worst hit towns and cities are being cancelled.
Drivers are also being asked to be extra careful on the roads again as some councils say they are running low on the gritting salt that helps stop people and vehicles slipping.
We can look for another potential source of democratic strength by considering one of its imperfections, the tendency from time to time for democracy to turn into illiberal majoritarianism.
But is the demonisation of global trade and technological progress good for sustainable development and how democratic is it?
O2 has the exclusive network rights to the phone in the UK with Carphone Warehouse as its high street partner.
Officially, both firms say they are "reviewing stock situation".
But it is thought they are unlikely to order more units ahead of the summer, when a new 3G version of the iPhone is expected to go on sale.
The larger 16 GB model is available from all three outlets at �329.
Customers must sign up to an 18 month contract on O2 starting at �35 a month.
Operators in other countries have also cut their prices.
The 8GB model is available in Germany for around �80 after a price cut from operator T-Mobile.
It is thought that mobile companies are trying to shift a backlog of 8 GB iPhones ahead of the rumoured launch of a new model, perhaps as early as next month.
As usual, Apple is refusing to confirm or deny any of the speculation.
But it is thought the new model will support faster 3G data connection speeds.
Internet blogs claim the phone will come with an extra digital camera hidden behind the touch screen to film the user in conversation.
Apple is also expected to replace the standard LCD display with more expensive Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) technology.
That would save on battery life and reduce the thickness of the phone.
As things stand, the iPhone is tied to one select operator in each country although it is possible to unlock the phone to use it on a rival network.
There is speculation that Apple might scrap that system and offer the new iPhone to a range of mobile phone companies at a set price.
But the chains under scrutiny - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway and Somerfield - must agree to a new code of practice in their dealings with suppliers.
Large grocery chains had been accused of pressuring suppliers, particularly farmers, to accept low prices for their goods
However, the charge triggering the investigation, that UK supermarkets were ripping off consumers, was not confirmed by the Competition Commission.
One reason for that was the fact that the market had become more competitive since the inquiry was opened, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said.
The watchdog said supermarkets were "broadly competitive".
But it did find some fault with supermarket practices.
It highlighted three areas in which supermarkets were operating in a way that distorted competition.
The director general of the Office of Fair Trading now has three months to agree a code of practice with the five supermarket chains on their relationships with suppliers.
Supermarkets will have to give legally binding undertakings to comply with this code.
The Competition Commission has also expressed concern about supermarkets selling below cost and the concentration of chains in some areas.
But it has not, as some newspapers had predicted, recommended a change to the planning regime.
It does propose that the larger chains should have to get approval from the director general of fair trading before buying or developing new stores close to existing stores.
Some of the large supermarket chains have already welcomed the report's conclusions.
"We have always said that this was a competitive industry, the commisison has found that prices are falling, that profits are not excessive and that according to their own research, customers like supermarkets," Tim Mason, marketing director at Tesco said.
Asda said the report was a "thumbs up for the Wal-Mart effect", a reference to its takeover of the supermarket last year which has boosted competition in the retail sector.
But an Asda spokesman questioned whether a legally binding code of conduct was needed to govern relationships withsuppliers.
Consumer groups welcomed the creation of a legally binding code.
Phil Evans, principal policy adviser at the Consumers' Association, said it would clean up one of the "murkiest areas of operation for the big four and it is good to see that it will be cleaned up".
Much of the report had been leaked in advance of Tuesday's release.
The large chains have spent about �20m defending themselves since the inquiry was launched in 1998.
Some larger chains - including Tesco and Asda - have announced price cuts in recent weeks.
A week ago Tesco announced price cuts and on Monday, Asda launched a new line of budget products where some items will be sold below cost price.
Breguet, one of the closest known associates of Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - otherwise known as Carlos, went missing about five years ago in his mid-forties.
He had been living in Greece at the time of his disappearance.
Forensic tests have shown that the remains found in the coastal village of Drepanon were those of a middle-aged man.
His family has always maintained that Breuget had been murdered.
The Venezuelan-born Carlos, of deep Communist conviction, gained international notoriety as a mastermind of deadly bombings, assassinations and hostage-takings.
He was snatched in Sudan in 1994 and is now serving a life sentence in Paris for the murder of two French security agents and a Lebanese informer.
He established his reputation in 1975 when he took 70 people hostage at a meeting in Vienna of ministers from the oil cartel Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Three people were killed as he and the terrorists stormed into the building firing machine guns.
Greek authorities are to run the tests on the remains this week.
If the samples do not match up, police are expected to examine links to the mafia or drug-trafficking.
The remains were found in an area known to be on the drug smuggling circuit between Albania, Italy and Greece.
Heading the senior Royal guests were the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who sat in the Quire on the right of the altar with the most senior Rhys-Joneses on the left.
Prince Edward's eldest brother, Prince Charles, and the Duke of York both acted as "supporters", the Royal equivalent of best men.
Charles' sons Prince William, who is 17 on Monday, and Prince Harry, 14, sat with Andrew's daughters, Princess Beatrice, 10, and Princess Eugenie, eight.
Prince Edward's sister, the Princess Royal, attended with husband Commodore Timothy Laurence and children Peter, 21, and Zara Phillips, 18.
Minor Royals seated in the Quire included the Duke andDuchess of Gloucester with daughters Lady Davina and Lady Rose Windsor, and the Duke andDuchess of Kent with son Lord Nicholas Windsor, daughter Lady Helen Taylor andher husband Timothy.
Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon's son Viscount Linley was not presentbecause his wife Serina is about to have their first child.
Sir Robin Janvrin, the Queen's private secretary, was also there, with Lord Fellowes, the former private secretary recently elevated to thepeerage.
Prince William and Prince Harry's former nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, was seatedfurther back in the Nave, as was TV celebrity Sir David Frost, with more than 400 otherguests in rows of chairs five deep.
Actress Ruthie Henshaw, who was once agirlfriend of Prince Edward's, and former racing driver Jackie Stewart, were also among the friends of the couple.
Many representatives from European royal families were also present.
Also from Europe were Prince Georg of Hanover, the Prince of Astorias, and Prince Philipp and Princess Xenia of Nohenlohe-Langenburg.
From slightly further afield, Prince El Hassan of Jordan and the Sultan of Brunei also watched the exchange of vows - the latter with his two wives.
Phil Zimmermann says surveillance in the UK has gone too far
The UK is risking sliding unwittingly into a police state because of the growing use of surveillance technology, says security guru Phil Zimmermann.
For him, the wholesale use of surveillance systems has gone too far in the UK.
The coupling of CCTV cameras with face-recognition algorithms that can track people through crowds, read registration plates and fuse all the sources of data was, dangerous, said Mr Zimmermann.
"It adds up to something that I think is able to undermine democratic institutions," he said.
For Mr Zimmermann what is creating the problem is the "seductiveness" of modern computer technology.
Advances have removed the "friction" that, in the real world act as a balance to excess, said Mr Zimmermann.
For instance, he said, the reason that the postal system is not swamped with junk mail like e-mail systems is because sending direct mail costs money.
"In e-mail it costs nothing and so that makes the friction disappear and because of that we get thousands of junk e-mails a day," he said.
"By analogy, if it takes some work, some elbow grease, to investigate people then I think you get a reasonable balance of civil liberties," he said.
The danger, he said, came when technology removed that friction and made it possible to get at huge amounts of data about people and analyse it to get a picture of what everyone is doing.
It was "absurd" to suggest, said Mr Zimmermann, that only criminals or people who had something to hide would be threatened by such a state of affairs.
While technology could help people defend themselves against some intrusions into privacy, such as using encryption to scramble the content of e-mail messages, it could not defend against the wholesale use of surveillance systems in public.
But, he warned, that did not excuse the extent to which it was starting to be used.
"I think that is harmful to society," he said.
"If you create a system where the police have too easy a job there's a threshold where if it becomes too easy it can slide into a police state," warned Mr Zimmermann.
Mayweather has won world titles at five weights and is recognised as the world's best pound-for-pound fighter.
"You can't argue with his record or what he's done but all good things come to an end," Hatton told the BBC.
Hatton, who has yet to taste defeat in 43 bouts, is not as quick but has steeliness and confidence on his side.
He weighed in two pounds under the welterweight limit ahead, while Mayweather came in exactly on the limit at 147lb, with the two being held back as they faced each other down on the scales.
A fired-up Hatton addressed the 6,000 raucous British fans inside the MGM Grand hotel, with many more outside.
"What can I say for a turnout like that, absolutely fantastic," he said.
While most boxers arrive in Las Vegas with entourages, Hatton arrives with the whole of Manchester in tow.
In the early hours of Sunday, people all over Britain with a minority interest in boxing will be watching him fight.
If the outcome of his bout for the American's WBC welterweight crown were to be decided by public vote, Hatton would win by a landslide.
But the sport of boxing is far less sentimental than that and Mayweather's camp are determined Hatton will not claim victory on a wave of emotion.
But the fact that he isn't doesn't make him any less of a talent.
Middleweight legend Bernard Hopkins is one of the few Americans who thinks Hatton, 29, has what it takes to upset the odds.
Constant pressure, non-stop punching, shots thrown from every conceivable angle - Hopkins believes Mayweather will not have experienced anything like it before.
But others, Britain's former super-middleweight world champion Richie Woodhall among them, are not so sure.
Woodhall points out that if Mayweather were to hold his feet and stand toe-to-toe, he would surely struggle with Hatton's onslaughts.
But Mayweather, who despite the flashy demeanour is as prosaic a fighter as they come, is not concerned with putting on a show for the millions watching around the globe.
The hometown fighter, who is undefeated in 38 professional encounters, is only concerned with protecting his record, and if that means moving around the ring and jabbing Hatton's head off for 12 rounds, then so be it.
If the American - who has six inches more reach - decides as expected to fight from long range, there is a risk that Hatton could be clawing at thin air.
As for Hatton's famed body punching, his trainer Billy Graham believes his charge will force a stoppage if he manages to land enough shots to Mayweather's ribs.
But with Mayweather not willing to stand and fight at close-quarters, that's a very big if.
There is also the matter of cuts, about which both Hatton and Graham have expressed public concern.
Hatton has a top-class cuts man in Mick Williamson, but Mayweather's right hand, delivered in a slashing motion, could prove to be the decisive weapon.
As Hopkins puts it, "Can you fight like a hungry man when your refrigerator is full?"
But there was little evidence of complacency in his victory over Oscar de la Hoya back in May, and most American journalists believe he has never trained so hard.
All signs point to a 12-round victory for Mayweather but Hatton's confidence and tenacity will provide his legions of fans with hope.

Next year's Formula One rule changes could vastly increase costs in the sport, according to designers from two of the top teams.
Talking exclusively to BBC Sport Online, they said that the introduction of one-lap only qualifying could lead teams to spend millions more than they did in 2002.
That is exactly the opposite effect from that planned by the sport's bosses, who wanted to keep a lid on costs, as well as improve the sport's spectacle.
The technical directors of McLaren and Renault, Adrian Newey and Mike Gascoyne, believe that the changes will lead to the bigger teams building special cars for qualifying.
He criticised the rule changes as "not thought through".
Teams already used special engines in qualifying, but the rule change means that the advantages of building a special qualifying car outweigh the disadvantages.
Teams would build lighter, faster cars built solely for speed, without having to worry about reliability.
That means the entire design could be different.
"Under the new rules, there is one flying lap and then you put it away again - that is quite a big change.
"The engine has only got to do three laps - and only one of them is timed - rather than at least four timed laps.
Max Mosley - the president of motorsport's governing body, the FIA - dismissed the claims as "nonsense".
Newey said that the teams need to come up with some changes to the technical regulations to nip the problem in the bud.
"The teams need to sit down and say, 'Let's not try to be clever with each other - what avenues are open and how can we close them?'" he said.
"The best advice is that anything that could be done for a single lap during the course of one hour could be done for two, three or even four single laps - ie for the previous system.
"In any event, teams have to race the car that was scrutineered.
An FIA insider said that the issue would probably be discussed at a meeting with the teams on 4 December, and that a rule would be written to prevent it escalating.
South Africa says it needs one billion condoms this year, anticipating extra demand from foreign football fans.
This is more than double the number the government normally distributes, the health minister told the BBC.
More than five million people in South Africa have HIV - a higher number than in any other country.
South Africa is expecting some 450,000 foreigners to attend the World Cup.
Last month, South African medical official Victor Ramathesele told a medical conference organised by football's governing body Fifa that the country was preparing for the influx of visitors.
"There's going to be a large number of people who will be descending on to the country," he said.
Last week, South African President Jacob Zuma was on a state visit to the UK.
His government has been credited with giving new impetus to the country's fight against HIV and Aids.
The previous administration had denied the link between HIV and Aids, and suggested eating certain vegetables such as beetroot and garlic could act as natural remedies.
However, Aids activists have recently criticised Mr Zuma, who has three wives, for fathering a child out of wedlock.
They said he was not providing a good example.
The UK's Department for International Development (Dfid) announced the donation at a meeting in London attended by officials from several African countries with high levels of HIV.
Dfid said it was "supporting South Africa's leadership and drive to turn the tide on their epidemic".
US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz will brief America's Nato allies on Wednesday about the US response to the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.
But mixed signals are still emerging from the administration of George W Bush about how much information the United States are prepared to reveal linking the attacks with the prime suspect Osama Bin Laden.
The argument is between those who want to use every means possible to build and strengthen an international coalition against terror - and those who are more reluctant to compromise the sources of intelligence.
Inevitably it has led to questions about the strength of the evidence.
"I think in the near future, we'll be able to put out a paper, a document, that will describe quite clearly the evidence that we have linking [Bin Laden] to this attack," he told his interviewer.
Less than 24 hours later, President Bush failed to endorse the idea.
"As we are able to provide information that is not sensitive or classified, I think we will try to do that in every way," he said - a much more cautious approach.
What is not clear is how much information - classified or otherwise - points directly to Bin Laden or the network he heads, al Qaeda.
One unnamed official involved in the investigation told the New York Times they had collected electronic intercepts of communications that linked the plot to al Qaeda.
He said the information would probably not be made public.
It has also been widely reported in the United States that the CIA has a videotape of one of the hijackers meeting in Malaysia with other Bin Laden associates.
Yet, as Colin Powell and his colleagues repeatedly point out, the US has already published detailed evidence alleging Osama Bin Laden's involvement with the bombings in 1998 of US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
The US indictment of him runs to scores of pages.
Some of the evidence has already been tested in an American court - the New York trial earlier this year in which several Bin Laden associates were convicted for their part in the embassy bomb plot.
But perhaps the best prosecution witness is Osama Bin Laden himself.
His campaign against the United States is well documented - in his own television interviews and in several declarations of jihad, or holy war, he has made.
A triumphal video he released a couple of months ago left little doubt that he was willing to accept the blame for the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen.
So the argument about releasing evidence has become a political one - only loosely connected to the strength of the case against the prime suspect.
The Brazilian government pledged $14m for relief efforts there.
The military has been distributing supplies and medicine to tens of thousands of people stranded by the dramatic drop in water levels.
But on Sunday an army general said the relief effort was being hampered by the lack of federal support.
A state of emergency was declared in all 61 municipalities of Brazil's Amazonas state as the drought started affecting towns and cities further downstream.
Witnesses say rivers and lakes have dried up completely, and millions of fish are rotting in the sun.
Low river levels are preventing boats - for many the only means of transport - from using the Amazon safely, leaving communities depending on airlifts for their survival.
The Brazilian government has already sent 50,000 food baskets to the area.
The national integration minister, Ciro Gomes, said that the priority was to stop the spread of diseases caused by contaminated drinking water.
The environmental campaign group Greenpeace has blamed deforestation and global warming for the drought.
It quoted scientists as saying that the burning of forests has raised temperatures in the Amazon, preventing the formation of clouds.
Brazilian government meteorologists, however, have said the drought is the result of unusually high temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, that have also been linked to this year's devastating hurricanes.
River levels in the Amazon are expected to increase in the next few weeks as winter rains begin upstream.
"When he finished his sermon, he walked to the middle of the altar; at that moment, the shot rang out," says Sister Luz Isabel, who was among the congregation at a private chapel in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.
Archbishop Romero's assassination marked a turning point in the country's history.
His death and the violent clashes during his funeral in San Salvador's main square, in which dozens died, sparked international condemnation.
His murder was an embarrassment for the US administration, which counted El Salvador's right-wing regime as one of its allies in the region.
During his three years as Archbishop, Oscar Romero urged an end to the brewing violence and defended the right of the poor to demand political change, a stance which made him a troublesome adversary for the country's oligarchy.
His views also antagonised some within the Roman Catholic Church.
Executions, kidnappings and torture of the rural poor and activists who opposed El Salvador's right-wing government had become commonplace in the late 1970s.
The slogan "Be a Patriot - Kill a Priest" was written on many walls, indicating that the Catholic priests who had sided with the country's poor were also a target for the death squads that terrorised the country.
Archbishop Romero's murder has never been properly investigated by the Salvadorean courts.
In his Sunday sermons, broadcast by radio around the country, Archbishop Romero listed the abuses and demanded an end to the repression.
Through those broadcasts and his pastoral visits, Archbishop Romero reached people in the most remote corners of El Salvador; many of whom remember him vividly.
Irma Gutierrez is a single mother of three who now lives in the poor outskirts of San Salvador but she grew up in Los Sitios Arriba, a small village in the north, one of El Salvador's poorest areas.
She was there when, at the age of six and during a visit by Archbishop Romero to the village, she and her cousin were photographed in his arms in an image that became one of the most famous images of his ministry.
Sitting outside the church where the picture was taken, she remembers the episode with pride, and her adoration for Archbishop Romero has not abated.
The chapel where Archbishop Romero was killed remains almost intact today; it still serves terminal cancer patients at the adjacent hospital.
El Salvador has seen economic development and democratic advances in the 30 years since the archbishop's murder, but violence remains common.
The brutality of the civil war and the death squads lives on, often in the form of the "maras" - the criminal street gangs that have a strong presence in some areas.
The religious composition of El Salvador has also changed; as in some other Latin American countries, there has been a rise in numbers who belong to various Protestant denominations.
According to a study by the Central American University in San Salvador, more than 38% of Salvadoreans now belong to one of these Churches, a doubling of the figure in 11 years.
What Archbishop Romero would make of this change is impossible to know, but his memory today goes beyond religion and into pop culture.
Omnionn belongs to a popular local hip hop group, Pescozada, that has dedicated a song to the murdered archbishop.
He believes that Oscar Romero's widespread presence in El Salvador, on T-shirts, murals and hip hop songs, means the attempt to silence him failed.
"What his killer did was to keep three generations thinking about him", the artist says.
It echoes Archishop Romero's own prediction about his future a few days before his death.
"If I'm killed," he said, "I will rise again in the Salvadorean people".
The telephone banking venture had been widely expected to collapse after Dr Robertson said Scotland was "a dark land" overrun by homosexuals.
"In reaching this agreement Dr Robertson expressed regret that media comments about him had made it impossible to proceed," added the statement.
But bank came under increasing pressure to drop the project, which also pushed down the bank's share price by almost 4%.
Some Scottish customers were unhappy that their bank should do business with a man who holds views such as Dr Robertson.
The bank acknowledges that up to 500 people have switched their accounts to other banks.
The new Scottish Parliament holds an account with the bank and MSPs indicated they would call for it to be closed.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress also threatened to switch the business of 100,000 of its members, who use a Bank of Scotland affinity card.
The 29-year-old star of films such as Amistad, Contact and A Time To Kill, was released on bail of $1,000 (�600) after a court hearing on Monday.
The actor was also arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana, but was not charged.
He could still face a year in prison if found guilty of resisting arrest.
Texas police officer Michael Olsen allegedly spotted the star through a window, dancing naked and playing bongo drums.
On entering the house, Olsen reported seeing parts of a marijuana plant and drug paraphernalia.
Olsen said that McConaughey initially refused to be taken to the county jail in a police car, but complied after a second officer arrived at the scene.
Matthew McConaughey was born and raised in Texas and lived briefly in Australia following high school.
The actor went on to play in a number of major films, including Joel Schumacher's 1996 version of the John Grisham novel, A Time To Kill, which went to number one in the US box office.
He went on to star with Jodie Foster in the alien thriller, Contact and alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman, in the Steven Spielberg slave-ship drama Amistad.
McConaughey's most recent film was the Ron Howard comedy, EdTV, in which he starred as a ordinary man whose life becomes the subject of a 24-hour television show.
East Germans are fed up with the mainstream political parties and are looking for alternatives.
Government welfare cuts have added to anger over mass unemployment, and the feeling that the former communist East has no hope of catching up with the prosperity of the West.
"People are ready to support parties outside the political mainstream, which represent a different kind of politics," said Frank Schwerdt, a member of the NPD (National Democratic Party) national leadership, in response to the results.
As he spoke at the NPD head office, two vans with armed policemen kept guard outside - a sign that this is no ordinary political party.
Its success led to scuffles between police and left-wing protesters in Dresden when the elections results were announced.
The NPD has been linked to violent skinhead groups, but its main focus in the campaign was on frustration at the economic situation and welfare cuts.
These include cutting benefits for the long-term unemployed, and forcing people to take any kind of job offered - no matter how badly paid - or lose all state support.
"If you look back 15 years, people had a lot of hopes and the politicians said 'everything will be OK'," says Gesine Loetzsch, an MP for the reformed communist PDS.
"Now people see the reality, and they had different ideas about how reunification would turn out," says Loetzsch.
The governing SPD argues that the reforms, while painful, are necessary if unemployment is to be reduced and the social security system saved from bankruptcy.
This message earned it a stern rebuke from the voters on Sunday.
Germany's main opposition party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), has also backed the reform package - and also lost votes.
But the SPD remains the strongest single party in Brandenburg, where it will probably rule with the CDU - which still won more votes than anyone else in Saxony.
The impact of the protest vote will be limited for now, as the reformed communists and the far-right are confined to the opposition benches in the state assemblies.
The BBC's Interactive Reporter Siobhan Courtney reports.
Later, at a news conference, he paid tribute to the book's Japanese translator who was stabbed to death.
He also mentioned the Italian translator, who was knifed, and the "distinguished Norwegian publisher who suffered an assassination attempt".
Mr Rushdie praised the work of the UK Government and said he had come to learn that freedom of speech is worth fighting for.
But British officials said they did not imagine that the novelist would be walking up and down Oxford Street in central London.
Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations said he welcomed the announcement, and has been joined in praise for the Iranian Government by the French President Jacques Chirac.
The author has been living under police protection since 1989 when Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, a religious edict, calling for him to be killed.
He said Mr Rushdie was still guilty of blasphemous abuse of their religion.
Iranian officials say they are powerless to lift Khomeini's fatwa, saying it could have been lifted only by the revolutionary leader himself.
The author said the experience has taught him a lot about free speech.
"I hope I will cease to be a supplicant at the door of politicians and cease to be on the television news.

The 33-year-old has now pledged himself to the Premier League club until the end of the 2008/2009 season.
The Finland international, who joined Fulham from Southampton in January 2006, had one season remaining on his previous deal.
Niemi's decision follows that of defender Zat Knight, who signed a two-year contract extension with the club last week.
Niemi's value to Fulham was emphasised last season when he suffered neck damage after falling awkwardly in the Premiership draw against Watford on New Year's Day.
He played once in the next two months and without him Fulham won only one of their six Premier League matches in that time.
Brisbane might not have the hustle and bustle of Sydney or Melbourne, but Queensland's capital is still a vibrant cosmopolitan place.
Situated on the Brisbane River, the city is Australia's third largest and a sporting hotbed.
Demand for tickets ahead of the Rugby World Cup saw the games scheduled for Ballymore, home of the Queensland Reds, moved to the larger Suncorp Stadium.
As well as rugby, the city has hosted frequent Test matches and major events such as the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the Goodwill Games two years ago.
Modern-day Brisbane is a far cry from its origins as a dumping ground for the worst convicts from the New South Wales colony.
Australia's indigenous population inhabited the Brisbane region 40,000 years before a European settlement was developed, and many of the city's place names maintain those Aboriginal links.
After John Oxley led the first European exploration into the region in 1823, a convict penal settlement, notorious for its harsh treatment of prisoners, was established in the area.
Free settlers finally pushed for the end of the convict settlement in 1837.
And then Brisbane really took off with the gold rush providing the catalyst for growth which led to Queensland becoming a state 20 years later, with Brisbane as the capital.
Many of the structures built by early prisoners from English, Scottish and Irish backgrounds still stand across the city as reminders of Brisbane's convict past.
These days though, a relaxed atmosphere pervades the city.
With the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast just an hour's drive away in each direction, it is not surprising.
Dubbed "Australia's most liveable city", Brisbane has everything a major city should offer in shopping, theatres and culture.
There is plenty of lush scenery to visit during the day and after dark, the city boasts an impressive nightlife, which has led some to dub it 'Bris Vegas'.
Promising and versatile midfielder who is a valuable squad member for club and country.
Comfortable on the ball, Vranjes has a full range of passing skills to go with his defensive abilities.
He is also capable of playing as sweeper and in Germany he is known for his exquisite timing in the tackle.
How much of a role he will play this summer is unclear, but he is capable of making an impression on the world stage.
The appeal court in Casablanca also handed down prison sentences - ranging from 12 months to life - to another 21 members of Salafia Jihadia.
None of the accused were involved in the May bombings, which killed more than 40 people.
They were already in prison awaiting trial, having been arrested on charges ranging from murder to belonging to a criminal gang.
Lawyers for the men said they were not given a fair trial and are launching an appeal.
Salafia Jihadia has been identified by the Moroccan authorities as the main organisation behind the Casablanca attacks.
Two suspected leaders of the group are among those sentenced to death.
One of them, Youssef Fikri, had boasted of his crimes from his cell just a month before the suicide bombings.
In a letter to a newspaper, he confessed that he had killed one man for being homosexual and another for making disrespectful remarks about Islam.
The killings were part of his group's attempt to impose their harsh interpretation of Islam on the poor neighbourhoods of Casablanca in which they lived, says the BBC's Sebastian Usher.
Apart from murder, their other methods included kidnapping, arson and robbery.
The first hearing in the trial of those suspected of being involved in the May bombings is due later this month.
A rum distillery in Venezuela has long been plagued by crime from local gangs.
But the distillery solved the problem by making the gang leaders an unusual offer, as Brian Hanrahan reports.
Speaking on German television, Mr Schily said there were "more and more indications" that the blast was a deliberate act.
Eleven German tourists, including a 15-year-old girl who died of injuries on Thursday, were among the victims.
German prosecutors believe a fuel truck parked in front of the synagogue was deliberately detonated by its driver.
Mr Schily said Germany had "not only eyewitnesses and telephone taps but also material evidence" that the explosion of the fuel tanker was not an accident.
Tunisia had insisted the explosion was an accident, but officials have now said they believe the driver of the lorry to be a "suspect".
French police sources say the driver's name is identical to that published in a letter sent to the London-based Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi.
The writer of the letter admitted responsibility for the explosion on behalf of al-Qaeda.
Earlier this week German police released without charge a man arrested in connection with the explosion.
"The questioning and the examination of elements assembled by the investigators did not allow us to establish any evidence against him," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
The call for cheaper third-generation networks could have been answered by a small British technology company.
PicoChip Designs has found a way to cut the cost of building future mobile phone systems by recycling the base stations used to create existing networks.
Many mobile phone firms are struggling to raise funds to pay for the creation of new networks because of doubts that consumers will sign up for them.
On the back of its early work, PicoChip has already attracted significant development funding, and hopes to have prototypes ready early next year.
Now, Bath-based PicoChip Designs could have found a way to reduce the cost of creating 3G networks by recycling the base stations that form the heart of the network.
Instead of replacing base stations to create wireless networks for new technologies like 3G, PicoChip is working on reprogrammable hardware that can be remotely reconfigured to support new standards as they are developed.
Peter Claydon, chief operating officer of PicoChip, said typically the computer chips inside base stations were developed to support one mobile phone system such as the Global System for Mobiles (GSM) that is widely used in Europe.
Mr Claydon said mobile phone companies could fit PicoChip hardware into existing base stations to help them create third-generation networks, but this would only produce a small saving because GSM uses far fewer base stations than 3G networks.
More likely, he said, was operators avoiding having to set up parallel networks by using PicoChip hardware to create networks supporting one technology, such as GSM, and then gradually switching over to a third-generation system as it gained subscribers.
But Mr Claydon said because the chip was doing a single job of receiving a signal, interpreting the data within it and filtering out noise, interference and echoes, co-ordinating all the elements was much easier.
The soldier, from 22 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, died alongside two Canadian troops when their aircraft crashed in Zabul province on Monday.
A safety investigation had already "determined that the crash did not occur as a result of enemy fire," a Nato spokesman said.
The British soldier's next of kin had been informed, the MoD said.
The three men had been on board the Canadian army Griffon helicopter when it crashed shortly after taking off from a US forward operating base in Zabul province, about 80km (50 miles) north-east of the city of Kandahar at 1350 local time (0920 GMT).
Three other Canadians, including the two pilots, were hurt, one seriously.
"The loss of a soldier, friend and colleague is tragic and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time," he added.
The five others were killed while taking part in Operation Panchai Palang, or Panther's Claw, a joint mission by thousands of US, Nato and Afghan forces to improve security ahead of the Afghan presidential election next month by targeting several Taliban-controlled districts in southern Helmand province.
Seven US soldiers were killed in attacks across Afghanistan on Monday, four of them in the relatively peaceful north, in the deadliest day for US troops in a year.

Cloete last year became the first South African to win a world title and came second at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
The ironic gag is a reference to US Democratic White House hopeful Barack Obama, whose father was a Kenyan Luo.
The Illinois Senator, who last year visited his family's ancestral village in Kenya's western Nyanza province, has decried the ethnic tribal violence that has convulsed the country in the past week.
Mr Obama took time out from campaigning in the crucial Iowa caucuses to urge Kenyans to end the bloodshed.
"Now is the time for this terrible violence to end," Mr Obama told US government-funded Voice of America radio.
Kenya's 36m people are split into more than 40 different ethnic groups, each with its own strong identity.
Kenya has had three leaders since independence from Britain in 1963.
Mwai Kibaki, whose re-election as president last week is hotly disputed amid claims of vote rigging, is a Kikuyu.
The tribe, from the agriculturally-rich central highlands, makes up more than a fifth of Kenya's population and wields strong economic power.
Founding president Jomo Kenyatta was also a Kikuyu, while his successor, Daniel arap Moi, is from the Kalenjin tribe (12% of the population).
Kenya's current opposition leader, former political prisoner Raila Odinga, is from the Luo community (13%).
Many Luos feel they have been politically cheated by Kikuyus in the past.
The assassination of rising Luo politician Tom Mboya in 1969 was blamed by his kinsmen on the Kenyatta regime.
Mr Odinga claims Mr Kibaki welched on a deal to create a prime minister's position in exchange for Luo votes in the 2002 presidential election.
But many Kikuyu believe they shed most blood in the Mau Mau rebellion that helped win independence and that they therefore deserve the lion's share of victory's spoils.
Allegations by Luo supporters of Mr Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement that last week's poll was stolen from them has only fuelled a sense of grievance.
Corus said that even though Tata had made a proposal, there was no certainty that a full offer would now follow.
If a deal went ahead, it would be the largest Indian takeover of a foreign company, creating the world's fifth-largest steel firm.
Corus, formed by a 1999 merger between British Steel and the Dutch group Hoogovens, employs 47,300 worldwide including 24,000 people in the UK.
Beside steel, Tata's interests range from carmaking to Tetley's tea.
Rapid economic growth in developing countries, including China and India, is creating huge demand for steel and many firms are looking to add to their steel-making assets.
But as Chinese steel production soars, other manufacturers are trying to consolidate so they can cut costs and stay competitive.
Earlier this year, Mittal Steel bought rival Arcelor for $34bn, creating the world's biggest steel maker.
In 2005, Tata Steel was the world's 56th biggest steel producer, and a Corus takeover would represent Tata's first steel business outside of Asia.
A recent report from the UN agency Unctad highlighted the growing amount of foreign direct investment by firms in developing countries, which reached $133bn in 2005.
The Sun newspaper reported that the show will be fronted by current presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.
It said the US show would be the same as the UK version, but focusing on American cars, such as Cadillacs.
US stars will also test their driving skills against mystery racing driver The Stig, the newspaper added.
A spokeswoman for the BBC confirmed that BBC Worldwide - the corporation's commercial arm - had been in talks, but could not confirm details.
"BBC Worldwide has had exploratory conversations with the US networks to bring a local version of Top Gear to the US, but there is not yet a deal on the table," she said.
Top Gear has already been shown in the US on the Discovery Channel.
In November 2005 it won an international Emmy award for the best non-scripted entertainment show.
Top Gear made a successful comeback to BBC Two in January, four months after Richard Hammond was involved in a serious high-speed crash while filming.
Last month an estimated eight million people tuned in to see the last episode in the series - BBC Two's largest audience for 10 years.
The show is due to return for a new series in the autumn.
Three policemen and three of the attackers were killed during a gun battle in the city on Wednesday.
A Turkish government official said one of the attackers was known to have travelled to Afghanistan, AP reports.
Meanwhile, police may have captured the fourth gunman and seized a car used in the attack, according to local reports.
Private news agency Dogan and CNN Turk said the man was being questioned by police.
The suspect is believed to have fled the scene after driving his fellow attackers there.
Four other suspects were detained on Thursday as police investigated their possible ties to the attackers, Interior Minister Besir Atalay told reporters.
Earlier, the funerals of the three policemen killed in the attack took place in Istanbul.
Mr Atalay paid his respects to the dead officers, one of whom had only been in the police force for two weeks.
The motive for the attack is still being investigated, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul says, and there has been no official statement on media reports quoting police sources linking the attackers with al-Qaeda.
The relatively amateur nature of the shooting has led some to doubt whether it is the work of al-Qaeda, she adds.
A US state department spokesman said he could not confirm or deny reports of al-Qaeda involvement in Wednesday's attack.
According to witnesses, three men emerged from a car just outside the US consulate building, surprising police officers and opening fire.
Turkish newspaper Milliyet reports that one of the attackers - named as 26-year-old Erkan Kargin - travelled to Afghanistan two years ago where he was trained.
On Wednesday, Turkey's interior minister confirmed that one of those who took part in the attack had previously travelled abroad.
A police official is quoted as saying that if the al-Qaeda link was proved, it would be the first time that members of the group had used firearms in such an attack.
On Wednesday, reports quoted police sources as saying the suspects belonged to a Turkish Sunni Islamic fundamentalist group called the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders Front, thought to have links to al-Qaeda.
Turkey has seen armed attacks from a variety of groups in recent years.
The most deadly was in November 2003, when 58 people were killed by Islamist militants in suicide bombings outside two synagogues, the British consulate and a British bank in Istanbul.
But then the former paymaster general's wealth has been a double-edged sword for Labour, the party he has followed all his life.
But many of the headlines have been less welcome - the Peter Mandelson home loan, undeclared interests in offshore trusts, the TransTec affair and an alleged financial deal with disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell to name but a few.
Together they have tarnished the image of a Labour government Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted to be "whiter-than-white".
Born in Sheffield in 1938 into a staunch Labour family, Geoffrey Robinson showed early promise.
He won a scholarship to a London school and went on to study at Cambridge and Yale, picking up a command of French, German and Italian on the way.
In the days of Labour corporatism, he soon became involved in state-run industries, rising to become the financial controller of British Leyland and, at the age of 34, the chief executive of Jaguar Cars.
In 1976 he entered the Commons representing Coventry North West, where supporters describe him as a "great" MP.
His interests have also taken in ownership of the left-leaning New Statesman magazine and a place on the board of Coventry City football club.
Throughout the 1980s Mr Robinson was an asset to a Labour Party that severely lacked business backers of any profile.
But almost from the moment that Mr Robinson was made paymaster general straight after the 1997 general election his financial affairs came under tough scrutiny from the Tories.
Eventually they proved his undoing as a minister when details of the home loan deal he struck with Mr Mandelson became public.
Despite being small change to a man whose personal wealth at the time was estimated at around �30m, Mr Robinson's �373,000 informal mortgage triggered both men's resignations in December 1998.
His complex finances have also prompted previous censure by the parliamentary watchdog and the standards and privileges committee.
In November 1998 Mr Robinson issued a 54 second apology statement to the Commons over undeclared financial interests.
Mr Robinson's role in engineering firm TransTec, which he founded in 1981, also triggered long-running sleaze allegations.
A Department of Trade and Industry inquiry that looked into the firm's collapse eventually cleared Mr Robinson of any wrongdoing.
Investigators decided he was never told about a crippling �11m claim against the car parts firm.
West Midlands police also looked into the possibility of fraud charges over grants TransTec claimed from the government but decided not to proceed.
The latest controversy surrounding an alleged �200,000 deal with Robert Maxwell - Mr Robinson says he never received the money - has been seized on by the Conservatives.
They hope it will prove a mortal blow to his political career and a fillip for them ahead of a general election campaign.

The second election in less than a year was bound to be greeted with mixed feelings by the voters.
Predictable election fatigue was reflected by the decision of some broadcasters to cut back heavily on their amount of election coverage compared with February.
Interest was also muted by the opinion polls - the knife edge election contest which had taken place earlier in the year looked much more predictable with Labour opening up a strong lead.
By the time the campaign had creaked to a halt a working Labour majority looked a good bet.
Olof Palme, the prime minister of Sweden, is shot dead and his wife Lisbeth wounded in a street ambush in central Stockholm.
It is the second successive season the Spaniard has been top, while Anfield team-mate Steven Gerrard was second in the top 10 list compiled by SportingiD.
Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney moved up one place to third.
Figures are based on the number of official club shirts sold domestically and internationally.
Arsenal duo Cesc Fabregas and Andrey Asharvin were fourth and fifth, followed by Chelsea pair Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.
Manchester United's Nani and Dimitar Berbatov both dropped out of the top 10, along with Arsenal's Theo Walcott.
Former Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo had been second in last season's list but unsurprisingly his name does not appear following his world record transfer to Real Madrid last year.
Manchester United striker Michael Owen featured for the first time alongside Drogba, while Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher and Manchester City forward Carlos Tevez were top 10 re-entries.
Momo Sylla and Wallace both found the net inside the first six minutes, Bobo Balde headed in a corner and Paul Lambert shot home right on half-time.
A Stephen McManus header caught the Bairns out at another corner before Wallace thumped in a 25-yard free kick.
Andy Thomson scored for Falkirk but Wallace and Aiden McGeady pitched in with strikes in the last few minutes.
With Celtic facing a vital Champions League Group F showdown against AC Milan next week, manager Martin O'Neill made eight changes to his starting line-up.
90 seconds in Juninho dispossessed Mark Campbell near the half-way line and ran at the Falkirk defence before playing a perfectly-weighted ball to the overlapping Sylla, who coolly side-footed the ball past an exposed Darren Hill.
Celtic doubled their lead after just five minutes and Juninho was again the provider as he pounced on another mistake, this time from Scott MacKenzie, and he played the ball out wide for Sylla.
Falkirk almost hit back in the 33rd minute when Rab Douglas pushed out a shot from Darryl Duffy before Joos Valgaeren blocked a follow-up effort from the same player.
Douglas was again called upon in the 35th minute to scramble away a low drive from David Nicholls.
But Celtic added another goal two minutes later as Balde leapt above the Bairns defence to head McGeady's cross home.
Hill had to turn a Sylla shot round the post, before Balde swivelled and fired just past the upright.
Lambert did beat Hill in the final minute of the half, when he arrived at the far post to steer Sylla's cross into the empty net.
Defender Stephen McManus also got his name on the scoresheet when he headed McGeady's corner home from close range in the 48th minute.
McGeady, the highly-rated Republic of Ireland youngster, was relishing the time and space and he whistled a powerful effort past the angle soon afterwards.
Wallace did find the net in spectacular fashion after 56 minutes when he curled a left-footed free-kick into the top corner from distance.
Falkirk did give their vocal supporters a goal to celebrate in the 67th minute when Thomson burst through from Duffy's pass and forced the ball through Douglas' legs.
Wallace then fired past Hill from close range after 84 minutes.
McGeady was not to be outdone and he stepped inside a challenge before cracking a left-footed shot over Hill and into the net in the dying seconds.
Reed was number two to previous boss Iain Dowie, while Robson steps up from his role as development coach.
Plc chairman Richard Murray earlier said manager Dowie was sacked after a review of the club's structure.
Dowie, 41, left Crystal Palace in May to replace Alan Curbishley - who spent 15 years as coach at The Valley.
But Dowie won only two league games during his brief reign and Saturday's 3-2 loss at Wigan leaves Charlton at the bottom of the table with only eight points.
Varney would not comment on newspaper reports that Dowie's spell in charge had been blighted by player unrest.
Derby's Billy Davies, Cardiff's Dave Jones and ex-England coach Glenn Hoddle had all been linked to the Addicks but it appears the club are looking to Reed and Robson to turn around their season.
Former boss Curbishley had already ruled himself out of a return to The Valley.
Dowie, who is the first Premiership manager to lose his job this season, spent almost �10m on new players, including striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.
"It goes without saying, therefore, how hard it was after only 12 Premiership matches to reach the decision we have.
"Over the past two weeks we have conducted a review of the structure we put in place during the summer, which involved all senior football management staff.
"The results of this review have, we believe, left us with little option but to act in the manner we have.
Jordan is taking Dowie to court over his controversial summer move to Charlton but the Palace chairman offered a surprising vote of confidence.
"Despite my personal differences with Iain, on a professional level, at times, Iain was quite inspirational," Jordan told BBC Five Live.
"I think parting company with someone after 12 games is very early and is not what support is about.
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department (LASD) has been experimenting with a drone called SkySeer, which it intends to put into service later this month.
"It has a video link that sends data in real time down to our ground station - the operator can then see, in real time, what it's seeing," explains SkySeer inventor Sam De La Torre, from Octatron Inc - a surveillance technology firm.
The Sheriff's Department is keen to start using the drone in situations where conventional crime-fighting is either impractical or too expensive.
"It provides several things that we can't get other ways," says Commander Charles Heal, head of the LASD's technology exploration project.
The UAV's ability to hover in virtual silence over an accident or crime scene, without any risk to a pilot, provides both a tactical and economic advantage.
It is envisaged that SkySeer will be put to use when children go missing down a hillside in difficult terrain.
To save time and minimise the risk to rescuers, the UAV will be used overhead to pinpoint the location of a victim.
"It has different cameras - colour, low light and even infra-red - and so as a result of that we can even find heat signatures that are coming through the bushes and overhead," says Commander Heal.
With burglaries, the police say the SkySeer will be used get an aerial view of a building where someone is believed to have broken in through the roof.
The conventional approach is to call the fire department to bring in ladder trucks, allowing officers physically to climb onto the top of a building.
The developers are working on a so-called cyber command post to enable images to be viewed, anywhere in the word, in real time.
"If we're flying over hazardous material or something that we can't recognise, we can have a subject matter expert, maybe not even in the country, in a different time zone, that is actually watching the exact same information that we're getting.
"We will be able to incorporate his subject matter expertise into our decision making process," says Commander Heal.
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department has only one prototype SkySeer at the moment.
When it goes into service, the force's SWAT [Special Weapons and Tactics] unit will carry out the initial evaluation in real-life situations.
Commander Heal is quick to point out that it is not their intention to launch 'big brother' style surveillance operations.
"There's no place in an urban environment that you can go to right now that you're not being looked at with a video camera and you have nothing to fear from your own government - you are being watched by your fellow citizens," he says.
The BBC's Adam Brookes - who is travelling with the president - is keeping a diary for the BBC News website.
I can almost hear the White House wincing.
Images of President Bush trying to leave that press briefing back in Beijing have been transmitted around the world - and of course back to the US.
That's the incident where he tries to get out of the briefing room through a locked door.
It seems almost spiteful but the vast press pack - the "uber pack" - agrees that they are great pictures.
As the press plane comes in on its approach, Ulan Bator lies beneath us in a pall of smoke.
The Central Asian landscape is brown and wintry, creased by frozen rivers, with low hills carrying a dusting of snow.
Just before we land I glimpse Mongolian soldiers guarding the airport perimeter.
Hundreds of them are placed a few feet apart as far as the eye can see.
The "uber pack" is quiet as we drive in to the city.
There are murmured exclamations at the decrepitude of the Soviet-era apartment blocks and the throat-searing pollution.
We have left brash eastern Asia and now we are seeing the claw marks of European communism.
Two Mongolian sergeants are being much feted by the administration for shooting and killing a man driving a truck bomb.
But Mongolia has appeal for Mr Bush beyond its Iraq policy.
Here the people threw off communism and embraced democracy and a version of a free market.
Mr Bush meets with President Enkheayar in a nomad felt tent and in his speech to parliament Mr Bush is fulsome in his praise.
He likens Mongolia's transition to democracy to what is happening in Iraq.
Later he is treated to a sort of spectacle - traditional costume, yak and camel - and a short visit with a nomadic family specially shipped in from the steppe.
"It's really special," he says, and he looks energised.
After four hours he heads back to Air Force One and takes off for America.
The Asia trip is over.
The "uber pack" is enjoying itself and devouring the souvenir store.
I am very, very tired.
I leave the "uber pack", step from the filing centre onto the street for a few minutes to people-watch.
She gawps at me, laughs and beams.
I beam back and feel my spirits lift.
President Bush and President Hu step to the podium after their talks.
White House officials tell us that the meetings went well, despite the lack of tangible progress.
Later, Mr Bush meets the "travel pool" - a group that splinters from the uber-pack to dog his every move.
The event tonight is a "social dinner" with President Hu - very brief and much less fancy than a state affair.
Tomorrow will take us to Mongolia, one of America's favourite small democracies.
The Beijing winter is smelt as much as felt, the air sulphurous from coal burning stoves.
The uber-pack staggers into the China World hotel in the early hours of the morning.
Sunday morning, and the president worships at the Gangwashi church.
Gangwashi is administered by the "3-self" church - the state-controlled mechanism for regulating the Protestant denomination.
As he emerges from the service, the president is hymned by a tentative choir of Chinese Christians.
But he also uses the church as a platform from which to press for greater religious freedoms, and to burnish his credentials with his base at home.
Plainclothes security officers outside the church photograph and video the White House reporters - presumably to catch any unwanted interaction with local Christians.
It's the usual reminder that the limits of religious activity in China are delineated by the anquanbu - the state security apparatus - always.
Osan Air Base sprawls in the wintry brown Korean landscape.
The president has stopped here to address the troops.
A gleaming F-16 fighter sits on the tarmac as a backdrop; next to it, an A-10 Warthog, the slow, vicious ground attack aircraft beloved of the American infantryman.
When the President delivered the speech, "and bled" had been taken out.
The first day of summitry is over.
Many of them are Korean farmers who say their livelihoods are disappearing as cheap rice imports undermine them.
The police have turned their hoses on them, but it seems quite tame stuff by Korean standards.
President Bush has held a meeting with Vladimir Putin, the contents of which remain largely a mystery.
The White House didn't seem to know it was coming.
"There has been no official communication to the United States of a change of position by the South Korean government," was the line.
Kimchi, the sinus-shattering pickled cabbage.
And a rice wine flavoured with mushrooms - which the teetotal president will presumably avoid.
Saturday will see the uber-pack leave Busan early.
Here in Busan they will wear the durumagi, a sort of Korean coat decorated with "ancient Korean symbols".
"It's a race between the president and Putin to see who can take it off first", said one White House official.
Last night, I broke free of the bubble and proceeded to dinner in downtown Busan.
The glossy Apec briefing books blathers about Busan's "vision" of becoming a "dynamic international city by developing global fishery logistics".
I join a wonderfully polyglot group of BBC colleagues - British, Korean, Australian, Singaporean, Thai.
This morning, back in the filing centre, Apec is in full, mind-bending flow.
There's business with Apec accreditations, and then sleep - blissful, unadulterated hours of it.
But the uber-pack is reverting to its truest self, and domestic American politics is drowning out anything the Asia story has to offer.
So the pack waits for crumbs from the US president, and is gratified when, in a joint press briefing with President Roh, Mr Bush lashes out at Senate Democrats.
Very different to an impassioned President Bush in Japan on Wednesday, when he called North Korea isolated, backward and brutal, with "prison camps the size of cities" revealed by America's spy satellites.
And President Bush is only as good as his faith is strong and public.
Diplomacy will probably trump disdain.
The buffet in the Kyoto filing centre is serving breakfast, so it must be morning.
And here I sit in the pack of packs, the uber-pack of journalism, the travelling White House press corps, drip-fed.
The handlers have just come around with an advance copy of President Bush's keynote speech.
He's not due to deliver it for hours, but it seems the White House wants it to make the US early evening TV bulletins, so they've given it out early.
So now I must read it and file a story.
To accompany an American President as he travels is to enter a disconnected world - it's called "the bubble", and it's a logistical marvel.
On Sunday evening the travelling press corps - 100 or so strong - assembles at Andrews Air Force base, just south-east of Washington.
The regular White House correspondents know the drill, and move easily through the chaos.
The reception on board is lavish, and White House handlers distribute thick briefing books.
The books contain every fact and figure the White House considers we will need during the coming trip to East Asia and the Apec summit.
And Tuesday's dawn finds us speeding from Osaka's international airport to Kyoto - the highway cutting a swathe through industrial Japan, the factories dark and shuttered.
We have arrived in Kyoto before the president, and are now installed in the "filing centre".
I sit behind Chosun Ilbo, the Korean daily, and next to Persian radio.
The utterances of President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi will be piped in on TV screens.
Everything is provided for us, and every step of the next week and more has been choreographed down to the minute.
Michel Barnier, speaking in Egypt, said he had come to the Middle East to explain that France was tolerant of all religions and human rights.
The group holding the men has issued no specific threat but has given France until Monday night to lift a ban on Muslim headscarves in state schools.
The French government has vowed not to bow to the kidnappers' demands.
But the authorities in Paris are stepping up diplomatic contacts after President Jacques Chirac vowed to spare no effort to secure the freedom of Radio France Internationale correspondent Christian Chesnot, 38, and Georges Malbrunot, 41, of Le Figaro newspaper.
A top foreign ministry official, Hubert Colin de Verdiere, is in Baghdad for crisis talks, while Mr Barnier arrived in Egypt early on Monday to spearhead the case for the men's release.
The two journalists have been based in the Middle East for many years and have written two books together about Iraq.
Mr Barnier told a news conference in Cairo that the men - said to have been heading from Baghdad to Najaf when they disappeared over a week ago - had been doing their job to explain the realities of Iraq to the outside world.
"These two men of goodwill have always shown their understanding for these people and their fondness for the Arab and Muslim world.
"I call for their release in the name of principles of humanity and respect for the human being which are at the very heart of the message of Islam and the religious practices of Muslims," Mr Barnier said.
The BBC's Angus Roxburgh, in Paris, says the French are pinning their hopes on the fact that their country opposed the US-led war on Iraq.
However the group did not say what would happen when the deadline ends on Monday night.
Al-Jazeera said the group calling itself "The Islamic Army in Iraq" described the law as "an attack on the Islamic religion and personal freedoms".
The group is the same one that reportedly killed kidnapped Italian journalist Enzo Baldoni last week.
The law banning religious apparel is due to take effect when the French academic year begins on Thursday.
"The law will be applied," a government spokesman in Paris said.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has added his voice to those of the many Islamic leaders calling for the journalists' release.
The head of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Dalil Boubakeur, told the BBC that hostage-taking was not the way to change the laws of a country.
The ban became law in March after months of acrimonious debate.
It is regarded as central to the government's policy of keeping state institutions secular, but has sparked protests at home and abroad, with many Muslims saying they feel unfairly targeted.
HIV, the virus which causes Aids, is fast becoming resistant to the drugs used to treat it, according to research presented at a major medical conference in Chicago on Tuesday.
Scientists have discovered that more than three-quarters of HIV-positive people in the United States carry versions of the virus which are resistant to commonly-used drugs.
The researchers examined viruses taken from about 1,500 HIV-positive people across the United States.
They found that 78% of them carried HIV which has become resistant to at least one anti-retroviral drug, while more than half had a virus that was resistant to more than one.
When the virus within an individual evolves resistance to all three, the result is a complete breakdown of the immune system - the syndrome of Aids.
The new figures from the United States are not in themselves surprising.
Research in other parts of the world has produced similar findings.
But this is a much bigger study than those performed previously, and big studies produce reliable data.
Experts say the findings have two major implications for treatment and research.
Firstly, they demonstrate the need for new classes of drugs to tackle the virus in new ways - and, as other researchers have been telling the same medical conference, a new type called fusion inhibitors could be available within a year.
Secondly, the study reinforces the importance of safe sex, and safe use of needles by intravenous drug users.
The more people who carry drug-resistant strains of HIV, the more likely it is that anyone being newly infected will pick up a drug-resistant strain, reducing their chances of successful treatment.
Kirsty Wark discusses Syria's decision to forbid students and teachers from wearing the niqab - the full Islamic veil that reveals only a woman's eyes - with Professor Tariq Ramadan, Nigel Farage of the UK Independent Party and Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy.

Jeffrey Donaldson, Stephen Moutray and Nelson McCausland from the DUP met Gerry Kelly, Michelle Gildernew and John O'Dowd from Sinn Fein.
The group will meet every day until 23 February to arrive at a solution which can achieve cross-community support.
Mr Kelly said the atmosphere at the first meeting was "business-like".
"We have not said that we will sort out the issue of contentious parades in two or three weeks - we will try to put together a structure that will make it easier," he said.
But SDLP justice spokesman Alban Maginness said his party should have been included.
Sinn Fein's John O'Dowd insisted no-one was being excluded from the process.
"It would be perfectly natural for Sinn Fein and the DUP to prepare a report for the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister to be handed over to the Assembly," he said.
The DUP's Nelson McCausland said it was important to take "a positive and constructive approach" to the process.
"I believe the Parades Commission has been part of the problem rather than the solution and what we are looking for is a new start," he said.
Orange Order historian Clifford Smyth said much of the groundwork had already been done in the review of parading chaired by Lord Ashdown.
"It's possible that they're building on other men's foundations, so this short deadline can be set because they're merely tweaking what's already known to be in the background," he said.
The first and deputy first ministers have agreed to support the outcomes of the parading discussions.
The Hillsborough Agreement said it recognised the need for "local people providing local solutions".
It also said that any framework should reflect "respect for the rights of those who parade, and respect for the rights of those who live in areas through which they seek to parade".
Following the completion of the consultation process a bill will be finalised.
The first and deputy first ministers have said they will support all necessary steps in the Assembly to ensure that the Bill completes all stages before the end of 2010.
The 168-strong workforce at the plant in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, was told on Wednesday that it would shut following a 90-day consultation period.
It is the latest in a long line of closures for the manufacturer which has been badly affected by the withdrawal of orders from the high street giant Marks & Spencer.
The new job losses bring the total in Wales to around 1,400.
In a statement the company said they "regretted" the move.
It said continued consumer pressure on prices had hit profitability.
Emily Thomas from the GMB union said the union would be looking for meetings with the Welsh Assembly to assist the workers.
"We will spend the 90-day consultation period trying to work out every way for them to keep their jobs or get trained for other jobs - they're a highly skilled workforce," she said.
"British firms aren't winning these contracts but we have the skills, and it would save a lot of jobs," added Ms Thomas.
Assembly economic development minister Andrew Davies said he was "bitterly disappointed" by the decision to close the factory.
"Dewhirst has made a strategic decision to withdraw from manufacturing in Wales in a move to increase profits.
"Regrettably, they have kept us in the dark about their plans and have given us very late notice of their announcement.
"The significantly lower wages they pay workers abroad means that by re-locating they can achieve higher profit margins for the company," he said.
Dewhirst factories began closing in Wales back in 1998.
Workers at the Fishguard plant were told that the company had decided against moving their cutting operation from the closing Cardigan factory around 15 miles away.
A consultation period started two weeks ago, when the factory re-opened after its annual leave.
Dewhirst in Fishguard makes polyester ladies trousers for Marks and Spencer.
There will still be around 200 Dewhirst adminstration and technical staff left in Wales but they will not be involved in making clothes.
This latest news make a further dent in the already fragile west Wales economy which has been subjected to severe job losses.
In May more than 1,000 jobs went when the ITV digital call centre closed at Pembroke Dock.
Dewhirst's own prospects have been closely linked to those of M&S which has experienced a turbulent period in the past two years.
In 2000, the company also closed two plants on Teesside and Stoke-in-Trent in England.
Forrester Research says mergers and takeovers will be needed because third-generation mobile phone services will not move into profit before 2013.
It also says that the current generation of mobile phones is nearing saturation point in major markets.
With fewer new consumers to share around, there will be vicious price wars to come.
As this happens, operating profits will slide - just at the time when huge sums are needed to build and market next generation services.
Forrester says the companies emerging successful will include the UK's Vodafone Group, Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobil, France Telecom's Orange and British Telecommunications' BT Cellnet.
The fifth big player might be either Royal KPN of the Netherlands, Spain's Telefonica, Telecom Italia or NTT DoCoMo of Japan, Forrester said.
Forrester drew its conclusions after its research suggested European mobile network operators would face operating losses from 2007.
"Scale will become a key success factor as grim profitability prospects and huge capital requirements take their toll," the research group said in a report published on Friday.
"As a result, winning operators will consolidate into five groups.
New entrants to the market - some of whom last year acquired licences at great expense to operate third generation mobile phone networks - will not survive beyond 2007 either.
Forrester said average revenue per user would fall 15% in 2000-2005, to 416 euros (�265; $396) a year..
The decline would be steepest in voice and messaging services, where revenue will drop 36% to 313 euros a year.
Some other analysts agree, saying many mobile phones are now in the hands of people, such as children, who will not use the phones enough to justify the companies continuing to subsidise the price of the handsets.
However, a survey conducted by Siemens Ireland - whose German parent makes mobile phones - offered a different prognosis.
It suggested Irish mobile phone users would be prepared to pay as much as 63% more for third generation services including high-speed internet connections.
This might indicate a brighter future for the revenue streams of operators offering third generation services than has previously been widely assumed.
An additional factor in favour of consolidation among operators is that markets are nearing saturation point.
In the UK, for example, almost three in four of the available population now have a mobile phone.
Forrester predicts operators will be unable to increase penetration levels much beyond 80% in most markets.
According to the research group's 15-year projections, operators can expect operating profit to start falling from 2003 and move into loss from 2007.
Any recovery would be unlikely before 2013.
Forrester's research was based on interviews with representatives from 26 European mobile operators.
It also predicts the majority are planning to make the switch by 2006.
Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has described the figures as encouraging, showing the country was on schedule to meet these targets.
But within the industry confidence is less high that the targets can be met as much of the digital technology already in homes came free with cable or satellite packages.
It is feared that digital take-up will level off at around 75% with the remaining households ignoring the new technology.
The government has launched a number of initiatives to encourage people to buy digital televisions sets.
One has seen the introduction of a labelling system to take the confusion out of buying digital equipment.
There are also plans to create experimental neighbourhoods with free conversion to digital.
The government will regularly monitor take up rates in order to gauge the success of these schemes.
We have had no reports of any hostilities since the ceasefire came into effect at 0800 local time (0500 GMT).
The Unifil spokesman told me that the UN force in the area has had no reports of any hostile activities at all so far.
On the ground here, one has a feeling that confidence is growing.
In Tibnine, in the centre of town, there is a scene of devastation next to the hospital on the main road.
There are a dozen burnt-out vehicles from an Israeli artillery bombardment on Sunday, which caused a huge fire next to the hospital.
All the way along the road, up through the villages from Tyre, there are similar scenes of devastation.
One building is still burning and there are many smashed buildings along the way.
Further on in Bint Jbeil, the scene of heavy fighting in which nine Israeli soldiers were killed, [there is] a scene of utter devastation with few signs of life.
It will be clearly some time before life returns to this desolate place - once a bustling market town for the whole region.
I think I also heard a lawnmower earlier.
Six minutes before the truce began, I heard three final booms, one after another, but from 0800 local time (0500 GMT) onwards I have heard nothing more.
Still, there is no great sense that the conflict has ended.
It is still very, very empty here.
For now, Israel's cannons still point in the direction of Lebanon and thousands of Israeli soldiers are still inside Lebanese territory.
Israel says they will only leave when a robust international force comes in to take over and that could take 10 days.
Plenty could go wrong before then.
Pop producer and Labour supporter Pete Waterman gives his take on Gordon Brown's year.
Even as an ex-soldier, I find it incredible that we can commit so many servicemen and women to a conflict without the say so of an elected parliament.
New Adoption Support Agencies would act as an intermediary service and the request to make contact, by child and parent, would become a legal right.
The government is consulting on changes to the new Adoption and Children Bill, which comes into effect next year.
At present intermediary services are available in some parts of the country but not others.
When the new Adoption and Children Bill was first introduced in 2002, it only made provision for access to information after the Bill comes into effect, which is expected to happen next summer.
It did not apply to the 875,000 adoptions that have already been made since the Adoption of Children Act 1926.
But, following criticism from the Children's Society and other organisations, the government was forced to reconsider.
Ministers aim to introduce the changes in two stages - the first applying to adoptions made between 1926 and 1975 and the second all adoptions after that time.
Officials believe there could be an initial surge of between 20,000 and 30,000 applications.
Adoption Support Agencies will not be allowed to disclose any information without the consent of a subject of an inquiry.
Gill Ragsdale, who was traced by her mother in her 20s after being adopted as a baby, said the system of intermediaries was important for all parties, including adoptive parents.
"But some parents are very threatened, very uncomfortable with it - my parents were very uncomfortable - so it's very difficult for them to come to terms with it.
The government will consult on the changes until the end of July.
Last year, ministers said adoption would be made "fairer and friendlier" with greater support for would-be adopters.
It hoped to offer prospective parents stronger support and better training for their new role.
Children would also be given a bigger say, with their views made part of the adoption process.
They claimed soaring fuel prices and the falling price of cockles meant they could not afford to take their boats out from Boston.
It comes as fishermen from across Britain protested in Westminster against fuel prices.
The cockling season has just started and normally more than 20 trawlers would be heading out into the Wash.
The raid and seizure of equipment from Tory frontbencher Damian Green's office last week has prompted anger among MPs.
Speaker Michael Martin told MPs that police did not tell the Serjeant at Arms she did not have to allow it.
But in a letter police chief Bob Quick said officers "were satisfied" she knew she could insist on a warrant.
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith explained her role in the events last Thursday, in a statement to MPs earlier.
During the debate that followed, her Tory shadow Dominic Grieve said Mr Quick's letter was "incompatible" with the Speaker's statement to MPs in Wednesday.
The Speaker had said he did not authorise the search and had not been told police did not have a warrant.
But in his letter to the home secretary answering a number of questions about the search of Mr Green's offices, assistant commissioner Quick said Serjeant at Arms Jill Pay had been informed that they had to first seek consent before carrying out a search.
"The officers explained the nature of the investigation and the purpose of the search and were satisfied that the serjeant at arms understood that police had no power to search in the absence of a warrant and therefore could only do so with her written consent or that of the Speaker," he said.
Ms Pay signed a consent form allowing police entry, without consulting the clerk of the house Michael Jack.
Mr Grieve said the police letter was a "masterpiece of obfuscation" on whether or not guidelines had been followed and contradicted the Speaker's statement.
The Conservatives have also raised concerns about an inquiry conducted by a committee of MPs into the events, after the government said it would begin work after any police inquiry was concluded and any criminal charges completed.
Shadow Commons leader Theresa May said that bore "no resemblance" to plans outlined by the Speaker who, on Wednesday, pledged a "speedy and immediate" inquiry to report back "as soon as possible".
"It might not meet for months," Ms May told MPs.
Commons leader Harriet Harman said it would not be "wise" to set up a probe while police inquiries continue.
Ms May also said an instruction that it would reflect the political balance of the Commons was wrong as it meant it would be "dominated by the government".
The Liberal Democrats say they will boycott the inquiry, which they say has effectively been "neutered".
She said she wanted any debate to keep in mind four principles - to protect MPs in doing their job, to remember MPs were not above the law, to support the independence of the police and to support the neutrality of the civil service.
She was met with cries of "cover up" and "rubbish" from some MPs as she said it was important to get the balance right and support those principles.
"What we need is a cross party, whole House approach on these issues and not a party political divide," Ms Harman said.
The Speaker has said there will be a debate on the issues around Mr Green's arrest next Monday.
But the Conservatives say at three hours, it is not long enough and there should be a full day's debate.
On Wednesday Conservative MP Richard Bacon said the Speaker should resign, given that he had "failed in his fundamental duty to protect Parliament".
But Labour MP Stephen Pound backed Mr Martin and Serjeant at Arms Jill Pay "absolutely" to remain in their jobs telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Speaker's critics were being "wise after the event".
Items including computer files were confiscated during raids on all Mr Green's homes and offices last Thursday.
After the news broke last week that four addresses had been raided, Scotland Yard said it had had warrants for all of them.
But, shortly before the Speaker's statement, acting Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson revised the detail, saying just three warrants had been issued, while the Commons search had been "consensual".
When asked about this, a Scotland Yard spokesman said there had been "no deliberate attempt to mislead".

Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is delighted after being gifted a win at the inaugural Korean Grand Prix thanks to Mark Webber crashing out and Sebastian Vettel suffering engine failure.
Sourav Ganguly's fourth World Cup century was enough to clinch India a place in the final, courtesy of a 91-run win over Kenya in Durban.
Chasing 271 for victory, the East Africans lost four cheap wickets inside the first 15 overs before limping to 179 all out.
Left-armers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra did the bulk of the early damage, and Zaheer took the final wicket to finish with figures of three for 14.
Kenya captain Steve Tikolo stayed with his sinking ship, hitting a second consecutive half-century, including 20 off a single over from Yuvraj Singh.
But only one result had been likely for more than an hour before he played on to Sachin Tendulkar in the 44th over.
India now meet Australia in Johannesburg on Sunday in what will be just their second final, and their first since winning the title in 1983.
Late-innings fireworks had earlier turned an uninspiring performance from India into a near-impossible total.
A score of 188 for two with 10 overs remaining became 270 for four thanks to a 34-run partnership between Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh that occupied just 22 balls.
Just 14 boundaries came along the ground, but India also managed seven sixes.
Ganguly led the way with five, taking his World Cup total to a tournament-leading 14.
His fifth, a Martin Suji full-toss smashed deep into the crowd on the mid-wicket boundary, brought up his century from 108 deliveries.
He had faced 101 balls for his 83 when he became the sole victim of Tikolo's off-spin, pulling to David Obuya at midwicket.
Sehwag's wicket, a leading edge collected by Maurice Odumbe over his shoulder at mid-off for 33, was just reward for Peter Ongondo in a tight opening spell.
But Ongondo's arrival as a batsman was less effective.
Promoted up the order to three in search of quick runs, he faced just five balls, failing to get off the mark before top-edging a pull to mid-on off Nehra's first legal delivery.
Opener Ravindu Shah was already back in the pavilion, lbw to Zaheer Khan in the ninth over.
And the route was well-trodden by his team-mates, who were unable to score at anywhere near the required rate.
With bad weather looming, Ganguly brought spinners on at either end, accounting for 10 overs in just 29 minutes.
India were well in command by the half-way mark in the Kenyan innings but it took 22 further overs for the job to be completed.
The youngest of the three Obuya brothers was Tendulkar's second victim, lbw in the 46th over, before Zaheer bowled Martin Suji to end proceedings.
The annual press conference of LGT, the Liechtenstein bank at the centre of the tax evasion controversy, is usually a dull and dry affair.
And every question was about the scandal in which German intelligence purchased a data disc stolen from the bank, filled with details of Germans who allegedly tried to evade paying tax back home.
Fourteen other countries, including Britain, are conducting inquiries into their own citizens on the disc for tax evasion.
The head of the LGT, His Serene Highness Prince Max von und zu Liechtenstein, is a member of the principality's ruling family.
Speaking afterwards, when I pressed him on the �100m Britain expects to get back from UK taxpayers who used LGT to evade paying tax, he told me Liechtenstein was being treated unfairly - and that Britain, too, was a keen player on offshore finance markets.
The British government says it is keen to clamp down on people using other havens to hide their money.
But other critics also say Britain is being inconsistent, with tax havens such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands operating from British dependent territories.
"Because of the number of places that the UK allows to operate as tax havens, our role in providing the secrecy spaces that these locations provide, which harbour crime, is greater than Liechtenstein's," says Richard Murphy, a campaigner on tax issues.
Whatever Britain chooses to do, it will be in conjunction with other European Union countries.
The last time they took action, they produced something called the European Savings Tax Directive, which levies a withholding tax on anonymous bank accounts.
But a senior figure at those negotiations has told me that Gordon Brown, who was chancellor at the time, was instrumental in watering the directive down - something the Treasury denies.
"We need clear pressure from [the EU council of finance ministers] Ecofin and the Commission on Liechtenstein to provide more information to make sure people are not acting illegally to evade their tax obligations.
"The EU Savings Directive has already led to a big increase in transparency and co-operation across borders to prevent tax evasion.
"We need assurances that if criminal acts have been committed, the necessary action will be taken in terms of prosecution," he says.
Offshore locations around the world are watching closely - and some are sniffing a genuine change of mood.
Robert Kirkby is technical director at Jersey Finance, which promotes the island as an international finance centre.
Banking makes up 30% of the economy here, and Prince Max is defiant when I ask him whether Liechtenstein will have to back down and abandon banking secrecy.
Would President Vladimir Putin fly on to Iran, as planned, or would he cancel at the last minute and go back home?
You could understand if Mr Putin did decide to change his travel plans - Russia's secret services had supposedly uncovered a plot to assassinate the Kremlin leader in Iran.
A report about it had popped up on a Russian news agency on Sunday - unsourced, with frustratingly few details, and adding the sombre line that Mr Putin had been informed.
A Kremlin spokesman announced he had no information that Mr Putin's trip to Iran was off.
A few hours later, the same spokesman said he had no information that Mr Putin's trip was on.
Mr Putin himself was slow to unmuddy the waters.
After being received with military honours, he hurried off with Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Russian-German Forum.
And what about the summit, an event which ended up being pushed out of the headlines by all this talk of terror plots and assassinations.
But it did highlight the booming trade relations between Russia and Germany - the economic ties which grow stronger, despite political differences between the two leaders.
Lebanese queue to cast their ballots
A tight race is predicted between the US-backed 14 March alliance, which has a small majority in parliament, and its rivals, supported by Syria and Iran.
Initial estimates put turnout at more than 52%, a high figure for Lebanon.
Interior Minister Ziad Baroud said turnout had exceeded that of the 2005 election and was "unheard of in the history of Lebanese elections".
Some three million people were eligible to cast ballots.
About 50,000 security personnel were deployed to prevent violence - although no major incidents were reported.
Former US President Jimmy Carter, who heads a team of international observers, said Lebanese parties - and their foreign backers - should accept the result of the vote.
"We also hope that the United States and Iran and Saudi Arabia and other countries will also accept the results of the election and not try to interfere in the process," he added.
Lines of cars, some waving flags of various political parties, were on the move from the early hours as voters turned out in numbers to cast their ballots.
Many polling stations were besieged by long lines of people, especially in Christian areas, reports the BBC's Jim Muir in the capital, Beirut.
"I voted for the first time in my life today simply because these elections will decide in which direction the country will go," Elie Yacoub told the AP news agency after casting his ballot in Beirut.
Joseph, a Christian, said he was voting for the governing majority "to safeguard our freedoms".
Voting in his home town in the district of Jbeil, north of Beirut, President Michel Suleiman urged people to turn out to vote - "an important act that should be done calmly and with joy so that afterwards we can start to build Lebanon".
"Democracy is a blessing that we must preserve, a blessing that distinguishes Lebanon in the Middle East," Mr Suleiman said.
The leader of the current parliamentary majority, Saad Hariri, hailed a "great day for democracy, a great day for Lebanon" as he cast his ballot in Beirut.
Under Lebanon's power-sharing political system, seats in the 128-member parliament are split equally between Christians and Muslims, with further sub-divisions for various sects.
Saudi Arabia and Syria, which have been at odds over recent years, are talking to one another.
US President Barack Obama is trying to talk to Syria and Iran.
So the feeling is that these acute, international and local tensions that are reflected so strongly here are easing off.
There is a general feeling that the Lebanese want to get on, that they want to keep their country going despite their political differences.
Analysts say the result could depend on which Christian politicians are elected in a few key constituencies.
The Christian vote is said to be split evenly between the two camps.
Hezbollah is fielding only 11 candidates, though it is a powerful member of the broader opposition coalition, which includes the maverick Christian leader Michel Aoun, and the mainstream Shia movement Amal.
US officials have said they will review US aid to Lebanon if the Hezbollah-led alliance wins.
The current majority in parliament was swept to power in 2005, following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in a car bombing in Beirut.
The bombing forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon after a 29-year presence amid accusations of Syrian involvement in the attack.
The government in Damascus has strongly denied the claims.
In May, the number of Afghans seeking asylum rose to 900 - 200 up on the previous month and more than double the number recorded in May last year.
Afghans were the largest national group applying for asylum in Britain last month.
Galbraith poses Afghan election questions
Peter Galbraith said the $300m mission is now "leaderless", calling the UN special envoy a "terrible manager".
Speaking to BBC News, he also accused Norwegian Kai Eide of failing to act upon evidence of electoral fraud.
Mr Eide responded by saying he had the full backing of the international community and the US administration.
A UN spokesman rejected Mr Galbraith's accusations, saying public debate about the organisation's credibility in Afghanistan was highly unfortunate.
Mr Galbraith angered Afghan President Hamid Karzai by reportedly calling for a complete recount of the vote.
"Once it became clear to Kai Eide that this evidence would be harmful to President Karzai, he ordered us to do nothing with it," he told BBC World News America.
Mr Galbraith also launched a personal attack on his former boss, saying he had lost the confidence of many of the country's political opposition figures and was mistrustful of his own staff.
"So we now have a mission that costs over $300m a year with several thousand employees, that's leaderless," he said.
A UN spokeswoman at the headquarters in the US said the body was "certainly concerned" about the allegations of fraud.
"We're trying to do as much as we can to specify what the UN role exactly was, and what the UN role still is," Michele Montas said from New York.

Robert Brown has been in prison for 25 years for a murder he said he did not commit.
He claims senior police officer Jack Butler forced him to confess to murdering Manchester woman Annie Walsh in 1977.
Next month his case will finally come before an appeal court.
In the programme broadcast at 2235 GMT on 29 October, Ross McWilliam investigates the evidence that has lain hidden for decades.
There are allegations of police corruption and a cover-up that could now prove Brown was wrongly convicted.

But critics claim the tests are just party games and not serious science.
Ross McWilliam investigates for Frontline Scotland in the programme broadcast at 2235 GMT on Tuesday, 19 November.
Robert Brown served 25 years for a murder he always insisted he did not commit.
Now, thanks to a long campaign to clear his name, he is back on the outside, freed two weeks ago by the court of appeal in London.
Frontline Scotland has been with Brown since his release and in the programme broadcast at 2235 GMT on Tuesday, 26 November, looks at how life on the outside is working out for him.
Since he was freed on appeal, Brown has gone through none of the rehabilitation and learning processes in place to help long term convicts adjust to freedom.
The programme also talks to former inmates like Paddy Hill, who served 16 years as one of the Birmingham Six, about how it feels to be a victim of a miscarriage of justice.
United's Federico Macheda scored to set up a tense finale, but Drogba's strike, from what appeared to be in an offside position, proved to be a vital winner.
"The linesman was directly in front of him, there was not a soul near him and he gets it wrong," Ferguson insisted.
The victory left Chelsea two points clear at the top of the Premier League with five games remaining and in the driving seat to deny United a fourth consecutive title.
The London side dominated the first half, rewarded with a stunning opener from Joe Cole, and despite United improving after the break, Drogba came off the bench to score what turned out to be the winner.
The Ivory Coast forward was played through by Salomon Kalou and as he crashed the ball into the net, the United defence stood bewildered after Drogba appeared to be in an offside position.
United also had a penalty appeal turned down by referee Mike Dean when Ji-Sung Park was challenged by Yuri Zhirkov, while the visitors were denied a spot-kick when Gary Neville appeared to barge into Nicolas Anelka.
Officials got the big decisions wrong - Phelan
Dean was in the headlines this week after Blackburn's Martin Olsson admitted he deliberately went down in the box at Burnley because of the referee's reputation for giving penalties.
Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti remained unconcerned with the controversial decisions.
With the loss coming on the back of United's lacklustre defeat in the Champions League to Bayern Munich in midweek, Ferguson admitted his players lacked an edge in the opening 45 minutes.
Ancelotti, whose decision to start Drogba on the bench was vindicated with the second goal, was delighted to pick up three invaluable points in the race for the title.
Kettering dominated throughout but Lincoln took the lead against the run of play with a Lenny John-Lewis header.
The lead lasted 13 minutes before poor defending by Lincoln allowed Craig Westcarr to slot in from 10 yards.

After registering a massive 44-point lead from the 67-23 first leg victory, the Dorset outfit were 46-45 winners in the second leg at the Norfolk Arena.
Millions of French men and women may be facing the imminent arrival of the euro with some trepidation, but French banks say they expect no major problems when the new currency hits the street in just under a month.
"Ninety-eight percent of the work is already done," says Bruno Milano, director of a Paris branch of CCF, which wastaken over last year by the global banking giant HSBC.
"Now all that has to be done is the supply of the euro notes and the coins," he says.
His upbeat assessment is shared by the FBF, the French banking federation.
"Everything is going according to the scenario we set out," said the FBF's Colette Cova.
Most of these are individual accounts, but the 800 business accounts make up 60% of the branch's turnover.
"We went to see our business customers to see how they were organised -could their software could handle the euro, how they saw the arrival of thenew currency, what measures they'd taken, what training they'd had.
This will be especially high because for the first two monthsthey still will be accepting payment in francs but will be giving change in euros.
He says that on the whole individual customers are well prepared for thenew currency.
They're used to seeing prices in the shops in both francs andeuros, most of their salaries are now paid in euros, and they've all received their euro chequebooks.
This confidence is borne out by a recent survey on French attitudes to theeuro.
Those who wereworried said the biggest problem would be converting from francs to euros.
This includes newspaper advertisements, a euro section on its website, and a daily two-minute sponsored spot on a classical music radio station duringwhich experts in various fields discuss the meaning and the impact of theeuro.
It complements the French government's euro information campaign, onwhich it has lavished 45m euros (�25m, $40m).
The latest CCF information sheet on the "Euro Stand" reminds customers thattheir accounts were switched to euros on October 18.
It shows pictures ofall the new coins and explains what details to look out for in the notes toavoid being given forgeries.
It also tells them how they can get a preview of the euro by coming to the bank on December 14 or 15.
Banks and many large stores began receiving their supplies of euro coins inSeptember.
The months ahead will be busy, he admits.
"Obviously there will be a rush of customers in the first weeks of nextyear coming in to get their euros, and to change their francs," he says.
But he insists that his branch and the CCF in general, which has a further200 branches across France, will take it all in its stride.
Two hundred and fifty staff who are usually based in the bank'sheadquarters on the Champs-Elysees will be going out to the branches from14 December until the middle of February to help out with the switchover.
Afurther 350 temporary staff who have also had special training will also betaken on for the same period.
Chris Mason, a Medical Research Council Clinical Fellow at University College London who developed the technique won the �10,000 National Endowment for Science, Technology & the Arts prize at the Medical Futures Awards in London, announced on Thursday.
His idea will also be fast tracked through NESTA's Invention and Innovation programme, with the chance of possible further funding of up to �100,000.
Mr Mason told BBC News Online that he believed his automated system would move tissue engineering away from being a "cottage industry" where tissue is made in laboratories by hand.
Even whole organs could one day be created.
In the system Mr Mason has devised, a patient's cells are mixed with the chemicals, then injected into a disposable plastic mould where they multiply.
Because this happens within the mould, there is less chance of contamination and the procedure is more efficient.
The initial research will focus on creating blood vessels for use in cardiac bypass surgery.
At the moment a vein is transplanted from the patient's own leg.
This can be lengthy and painful - so much so that many patients complain about leg pain rather than chest pain after surgery.
The automated tissue engineering system should mean patients spend less time in hospital and free up surgeon's time.
Mr Mason estimated around one million metres of blood vessels are needed each year for cardiac bypass surgery, many more than are currently made.
He said his automated system was better than the existing system because there was no human contact with the blood vessel until the surgeon removes it to transplant it into the patient.
But Mr Mason warned it could be at least seven years before trials involving patients begin.
He also suggested automated engineering of human tissue could allow an ethical alternative to testing drugs on animals.
"You make a much better quality product when you automate something - what you make on Monday is the same as what you make on Tuesday and on Wednesday"
He said more heart bypasses could be done once the technique was in use.
US researchers say their findings, published in Science, could explain why some breast cancers lead to new tumours long after the disease is treated.
Secondary, or metastatic, cancers are responsible for the majority of deaths from the disease.
UK experts said it was essential to know more about how the cancer spreads.
It has traditionally been thought that the spread of cancer to another site in the body was a late event that only occurred when a disease was advanced.
Cancer cells had been thought to have stayed in place until they had undergone a series of genetic alterations making them more aggressive.
They have to be able to survive the journey through the bloodstream and be able to initiate malignant growth in their new environment in the new site.
In this latest research, by a team at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center in New York, mice were injected with normal breast tissue cells which had been manipulated so the scientists could "switch on" cancer genes (oncogenes).
It was found that the cells were capable of travelling in the bloodstream to the lungs and surviving there for up to 16 weeks without expressing any oncogenes.
The cells did not begin growing aggressively in the lungs until the oncogenes had been turned on.
The researchers say that examining each step of the process by which cancer metastasizes, including those involving normal cells, it might be possible to work out ways to destroy the cells responsible for the disease's spread through the body.
She spoke to Stephen Sackur at the Editorial Intelligence conference in Portmeirion, in North Wales.
The move will be made as part of its commitment to make more use of technology and the web to transform official services.
Currently organisations that want access to datasets that tie postcodes to physical locations cannot do so without incurring a charge.
Following a brief consultation, the postcode information is set to be freed in April 2010.
The announcement about releasing postcode data came as part of a much wider plan to use technology as part of the Smarter Government strategy.
A spokesman for the Ordnance Survey said the consultation would begin before Christmas 2009.
"It's a chance for anyone who has views on what can be given away to make those views known," he said.
In October 2009 the Royal Mail took legal action that cut off the access many websites had to such data.
Harry Metcalfe, who helped sites get at postcode data, said he was "cautiously optimistic" about the decision to open up the OS data sets.
"If the right data is released in the right way, this will be a positive development," he said.
Also included in the Smarter Government announced by Gordon Brown was the intention to get the "majority" of government services online in the next five years.
It also pledged a further £30m cash injection for UK Online Centres to help another million Britons get to grips with the web for the first time.
Five hundred Black Watch soldiers and 350 support personnel will move from Basra to the US sector in central Iraq, but remain under British control.
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher praised Britain's support, saying it demonstrated "the kind of role that Britain is prepared to play".
Defence chief Gen Michael Walker said the troops would be home for Christmas.
The redeployment was announced by Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon on Thursday after ministers agreed to the US request, based on a recommendation from Gen Walker.
Details of when and where Black Watch will go have not been disclosed, but officials have said it will be within a large area to the south and west of Baghdad.
Gen Walker said the troops will be under "tactical control" of the US commander, but "he has no authority to give them orders that would, in any way, be against the doctrine and training that we would undertake".
He reiterated the government's promise that Black Watch will be home for Christmas.
Mr Hoon told MPs there was a "compelling military operational justification" for the move, and it entailed a "militarily acceptable" level of risk.
Preparations for the redeployment have been under way at the Black Watch's base in Basra, in southern Iraq, for several days.
The regiment's Warrior armoured fighting vehicles have been reinforced to provide better protection against possible insurgent attacks.
Shadow Defence Secretary Nicholas Soames said the Tories supported the redeployment as "a necessary military contribution" but criticised the length of time taken to announce a decision, after initial reports of the US request emerged last Friday.
So why did so many people there fail to exercise their democratic right?
Liverpool City Council said the high proportion of students in the area was one reason for the low turnout.
"The students are entitled to vote but I think they see their role more at home.
Stephen Potts, an 18-year-old quantity surveying student at Liverpool John Moores University, is one of those who will not be casting a vote in Thursday's elections.
"Students generally are not really interested in politics, everyone seems to be too lazy.
"I've got a friend studying politics, I don't think even he bothers with it.
"We got the forms through for postal voting but everyone ignored them, I just saw them sitting on the microwave.
Adam Murkin, a first-year engineering student at the university, said he will not be voting either.
But Gemma Clark, 20, said she would be casting a vote in Liverpool on Thursday.
Kathleen Fanning, 62, has lived in the central ward all her life and has cast her vote in every local and general election.
Liverpool City Council has taken steps this year to encourage more people to take part in the elections.
Mr Kidger said he hoped to see turnout increase to between 20% and 30%.
Mr Kidger said the authority had also conducted a Black, Minority Ethnic (BME) registration campaign, with a certain degree of success.
"Obviously, once you are registered, you are more likely to be involved and at least realise you are entitled to vote.
Dr Neil Gavin, political scientist and senior lecturer at Liverpool University, said factors such as employment, standards of education and age of population in areas had an influence on voter turnout.
"Also, if the election is seen as a foregone conclusion, that is likely to make a difference," he said.
Dr Gavin said local and European elections also attracted a lower turnout than General Elections.
Ken Livingstone's spoke out after some footage was taken off the organisers' website on the advice of experts.
Charity Epilepsy Action said it had received 22 calls from people who had suffered fits after watching the clip.
But the logo's designer has blamed poor promotion for the negative reaction to it, rather than the work itself.
However, Mr Livingstone said the designer should not be paid a penny for the "catastrophic mistake".
But Michael Wolff, of designers Wolff Olins, who created the logo, said it has not been "done justice" and blamed Olympic organisers for not publicising it properly.
"I think it's a great shame that it's been shown as a static thing, when it's quite a democratic thing capable of a lot of interpretations," he said.
The animated film, which was unveiled along with the logo for the London Games on Monday, is now being re-edited by London 2012.
Organisers said the footage removed concerned showed a "diver diving into a pool which had a multi-colour ripple effect".
After its release Prof Graham Harding, who developed the test used to measure photo-sensitivity levels in TV material, said it should not be broadcast again.
Simon Wigglesworth from Epilepsy Action said he was shocked at the choice of animation.
The new logo, which cost �400,000 to develop, has also been heavily criticised and more than 38,000 people have signed an online petition to have it scrapped.
The BBC News website invited users to send in suggestions for alternative logos, and has so far received more than 500.
Alistair Dickey, 26, from Broughshane, was part of the University of Memphis-led team which found the tomb and five mummies.
It was the first intact tomb to be found in the Valley of the Kings since Tutankhamun's in 1922.
"The first half hour after we found it, we actually saw into the chamber - the whole team was on cloud nine," he said.
The archaeologists have not yet been able to identify the mummies.
Egypt's chief archaeologist Zahi Hawass said they "might be royals or nobles" moved from "original graves to protect them from grave robbers".
The Valley of the Kings, near the city of Luxor in southern Egypt, was used for burials for around 500 years from 1540BC onwards.
The newly-found tomb is thought to date from the 18th Pharaonic Dynasty, the first dynasty of the New Kingdom which ruled between 1539BC and 1292BC and made its capital in Thebes, now Luxor.
"We had been excavating workmen's huts - these huts belonged to the workmen that actually painted and decorated the tombs in the valley," Alistair said.
The force said recently a woman called 999 because she did not have �1 for a supermarket trolley and one in 10 999 calls it received were not emergencies.
The greeting is changing from "South Wales Police how can I help" to "South Wales Police what is your emergency?"
Experts at Cardiff University say it may make people think more carefully about what their actual emergency is.
To reduce the number of non-urgent calls, control room staff will answer 999s in the same way as their contemporaries in many US police departments including New York and San Diego.
South Wales Police control rooms saw emergency calls rise by approximately a third more than normal over Christmas and the New Year.
The switch has been welcomed by Cardiff University researchers Professor Martin Innes of the Universities Police Science Institute and Dr Frances Rock of the Centre for Language and Communication
They are investigating the change as part of a long-term research project to improve telephone contact between the force and the public.
"We hope our studies will improve the working lives of people who answer and respond to calls and will improve the experience of members of the public who call South Wales Police.
The change in how 999 calls are answered is one of the first major changes introduced by Supt Kevin O'Neill, who is the new divisional commander for communication.
Supt O'Neill said he hoped the new approach would be a "simple but hopefully effective" way of answering calls.
"Calling 999 with an unnecessary non-emergency call could block a genuine call for vital seconds and put lives at risk.
Beckham, 33, is currently scheduled to return to Galaxy on 9 March.
"Negotiations are getting more intense," said the Italian club's vice-president Adriano Galliani.
Beckham, who signed a five-year deal with the Galaxy in January 2007, moved to Milan in January to stay fit during the Major League Soccer off-season and so maintain his bid for an England place.
"It's a complicated path, as we have always known, but I'm trying," Galliani added on the Serie A side's TV channel.
Galaxy supremo Tim Leiweke last week described Milan's recent offer for the player as "ridiculous".
But Mr Stoiber said high taxes damaged economic growth and destroyed jobs.
Tax cuts and help for the victims was his party's strategy, he said.
BBC Berlin correspondent Rob Broomby says the chancellor set out to make a good impression in parliament, just days after he failed to outshine Mr Stoiber in a pre-election television duel.
According to Mr Schroeder, 180,000 homes have been flooded and 740 kilometres (460 miles) of roads have been destroyed.
The rebuilding of Eastern Germany had been set back years, and in many regions people would have to start almost from scratch, he said.
But from the reunification of Germany had come the unity of the Germans in head and heart, he added.
Correspondents say the government's record in dealing with the floods has wrong-footed the opposition, which has said it will not block Mr Schroeder's plan to delay tax cuts, even though it objects to it.
With less than a month to go before a general election, most opinion polls still put the conservatives ahead of the Social Democrats - though the floods have helped Mr Schroeder narrow the gap.
The conservatives' short-term plan to finance flood assistance using central bank profits, was widely criticised as borrowing in disguise, and rejected by the bank itself.
The final cost of the cleanup could be as high as 15 billion euros for Germany alone.
Some money has already begun to flow to those affected.
A team of Argentine scientists found the drug helped hamsters recover up to 50% faster from forward shifts in their daily time cycles.
However, the drug only worked in conjunction with light therapy, and only in one time direction - the equivalent to flying eastbound.
The study features in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
In mammals, the light-dark cycle regulates the body's biological clock, which promotes activity during the daytime, when it is light, and sleep at night.
The researchers from the National University of Quilmes shifted the light-dark cycle of hamsters six hours forwards, by switching on lights six hours earlier than usual.
They then monitored the hamsters' running wheel activity to assess when their body clocks had adjusted to the new time cycle - the hamsters are active in the day but stop running when the lights go out.
Injection of Viagra before the time shift meant the hamsters adjusted to the new time cycle faster, even when low doses of the drug, which did not cause penile erections, were used.
Viagra, the drug sildenafil, was originally developed for the treatment of high blood pressure and angina, and is used to treat erectile dysfunction.
When used without the shifts in light, the drug did not induce changes in the hamsters' activity, so it seems to work by enhancing the light-induced response.
Dr Diego Golumbek, who led the research, said the drug seemed to work via a molecule called cGMP which is known to have a role in setting the body's time clock - it is present at higher levels during the day.
The Viagra blocks the activity of an enzyme which breaks down cGMP, allowing higher levels to build up.
Dr Golumbek said the fact that different mechanisms may be used to slow down and speed up the body clock explains why Viagra only worked when the lights were switched on early, not late.
Professor Robert Lucas, from Manchester University, said although looking for ways adjust biological clocks was important, regulating light exposure was the most widely accepted strategy for doing this.
Pfizer, the makers of Viagra, said the drug should only be used in accordance with the approved labelling.
"Human rights were traded away in almost all parts of the world," Amnesty Secretary General Irene Khan said, publishing the report in London.
The United Liberation Front of Assam (Ulfa) said the Bhutanese army had agreed to accept them.
Over 120 people have died since Bhutan launched its first offensive against Indian rebel groups on Monday.
Three rebel groups have used Bhutan as a base for operations against India for the past decade.
Ulfa told the BBC's Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta that it had appealed to the Red Cross to intervene to protect the women and children.
However, group spokesman Rubi Bhuyan said there had been no response and the rebels were left no choice but to surrender the families and injured.
An Indian army official said Ulfa was trying to use the Red Cross to secure safe passage for their rebels and allow them to escape capture.
Lieutenant-General Jitender Singh Varma said if the Red Cross went into Bhutan most of the rebels would hide their weapons and register with the international organisation as sick or non-combatants.
He said most of the rebels had fled from their bases and gone into the jungles of southern and western Bhutan.
Several leaders have been captured, but General Varma said the top Ulfa leaders, Paresh Barua and Aurobindo Rajkawa, had escaped to Bangladesh.
About 6,000 Bhutanese troops have destroyed almost all of the 30 rebel camps in the country during the offensive, officials say.
The camps were said to have sheltered about 3,000 rebels.
Indian troops have been deployed on the country's border with Bhutan to prevent rebels from fleeing into India.
The three rebel groups are Ulfa, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO).
Ulfa is fighting for Assam's independence from India while the NDFB and the KLO are fighting for separate tribal homelands.
Sabotage - on both sides
Fox hunting and the famous
He lost his parole bid last December on the basis of secret evidence.
A judge ruled his case was "of great public interest" and gave him leave to seek a High Court judicial review.
The murder of Pc Geoffrey Fox, 41, Sgt Christopher Head, 30, and Det Con David Wombwell, 25, became one of the most infamous crimes of the 1960s.
All three were unarmed and in plain clothes at the time of the attack.
The officers were shot in front of children playing in a street, after they had pulled over a van containing Roberts and two other men following an armed robbery.
Under current rules, Roberts can only be kept in prison if he is still considered dangerous or a risk to the public.
Roberts is being held in a low-security prison near Newton Abbot, Devon.
Bookmakers Paddy Power are offering odds of 6-1 on the Murphy's Law star becoming the 11th Dr Who in 2010.
Other names being mooted for the role include Paterson Joseph, John Simm and David Morrisey.
However, Nesbitt's friendship with Steven Moffat, who has taken over as lead writer and executive producer of the show has many pundits backing the Northern Irish man to land the coveted role.
Nesbitt and Moffat also previously worked together on the hit BBC drama, Jekyll.
Tennant announced that he was standing down from the role after winning the outstanding drama performance prize at the National Television Awards.
"When Doctor Who returns in 2010 it won't be with me," he said.
Grosvenor Estates have plans for a stadium and sports village which they hope to complete by 2017.
Three of the sites were indentified under a previous planning initiative, whilst another option is to move onto land already owned by Grosvenor.
The U's sold the Abbey to property developer Bideawhile in 2004 in a bid to avoid administration, which ultimately failed.
Grosvenor are aiming to relocate the club in a new state-of-the-art community facility and redevelop the Abbey for housing or retail.
The stadium development could include homes, office space and education facilities.
There will also be potential to develop the club's community activity.
"The Cambridge United youth programme is at the heart of what we're trying to do here," White said.
Three of the sites are those put forward by Cambridgeshire Horizons in 2008, whilst further options include land owned by Grosvenor as part of the Trumpington Meadows development and the former Blue Circle quarry.
"I think it's too premature to start naming a top two or three as we need to assess all of these sites," White said.
Grosvenor says the financing for the new stadium is secure, but questions remain over how the facility's running costs will be covered.
The U's are struggling to meet their costs at the Abbey, but White says the new development will open fresh revenue streams to the club.
"The plan is to have several revenue spin-offs for the football club with conference facilities, retail facilities and hotel facilities," he said.
The aim of the game is simple - to lift more weight than anyone else.
The Olympics and Commonwealth Games competitions are divided up into weight categories.
This also includes powerlifting for elite athletes with a disability (EAD).
In both categories, competitors are given three attempts to complete a lift.
The heaviest successful lift in each category contributes towards the total score, so if an athlete lifts 90 kg in the snatch and 130kg in the clean and jerk, their overall score is 220kg.
In EAD powerlifting, athletes compete lying on their back and must complete a successful bench press within two minutes.
For a lift to be successful, the athlete must support the weight above their head, with the arms straight.
They must be in complete control of the weight, so the body should be motionless.
Three referees judge weightlifting, and a majority verdict is accepted as official.
A good lift is signalled by flashing a white light, and an illegal one by a red light, although the decision can be overturned by a jury.
If two lifters finish the competition with the same total, then the one with the lower body weight is declared the winner.
Most of the power required for weightlifting comes from the back, rather than the arms and legs, and lifters can support as much as three times their own body weight.
In the clean and jerk, athletes lift the weights from the floor to their shoulders, and then over their heads.
The snatch is the more difficult discipline, because the bar must be lifted from the floor and over the lifter's head in one motion.
The legs may be bent or split when lifting the bar, but they must come together to ensure the lift is declared valid.
In the clean and jerk, which requires a more narrow grip, the lifter pulls the bar to the shoulders in one movement, drops into a squat, and then stands straight up.
Once the arms are locked and the bar is steady, the lifter brings the feet back together to ensure the lift is declared good.
You can start weightlifting from as young as eight.
For young people, the sport is all about learning a new technique - it takes a very long time to get to the heavy stuff.
If you want to have a go, the British Amateur Weightlifting Association is the best place to find out more.
Stade wingers Christophe Dominici and Julien Saubade produced three brilliant finishes between them to give their side a deserved 17-6 half-time lead.
Having offered little in the first half, Sale battled back well and were rewarded with Sebastien Chabal's interception try on 70 minutes.
But Saubade's interception score with five minutes left ended Sale's hopes.
With a huge crowd of 45,000 looking on, the pre-match Moulin Rouge-themed entertainment promised a high-octane match - and so it proved as Stade's classy backs ran riot in the first half.
Stade's willingness to spread the ball, and fluency in doing so, stretched Sale's defence to the limit, with one superb early break from Mirco Bergasmasco halted just short of the tryline.
But after missing with his first shot at goal, Daniel Larrechea opened the scoring for Sale on 14 minutes with a straightforward penalty.
The visitors' lead did not last for long though, as within a minute Dominici had outstripped some naive Sale defence to provide a try worthy of the atmosphere inside the Parc des Princes.
Centre Geoffroy Messina powered through the first line of defence, before feeding the mercurial Dominici and despite having just inches to work in, he danced up the touchline past Jason Robinson's despairing tackle.
Stade's second try was even better, with the impressive full-back Juan Martin Fernandez straightening the line before passing to Saubade to chip over Robinson and collect.
To make matters even worse, Sale's injury crisis took another turn for the worse with their England wing Mark Cueto hobbling off with a hip injury.
Lee Thomas slotted a well-struck penalty after Juan Fernandez Lobbe was taken off the ball, but Sale were living off scraps and it was little surprise when Dominici crossed for his second try.
Again, Stade's backline gave their winger all the room he needed to stand up Robinson and squeeze into the corner with another tremendous finish.
After the break, Sale dug in with real character as they started to treat possession with more respect and their pack began to get the upper hand around the fringes.
A glittering Robinson break seemed to spark the visitors, and Thomas' second penalty was no less than his side deserved.
Stade's first-half fluency began to desert them, and it needed a long-range penalty from substitute Lionel Beauxis to settle their nerves.
The butterflies returned straight after though as Chabal intercepted on halfway to burst through for a try, and the conversion cut Stade's lead to just 20-16.
Sale were within sight of a losing bonus point at the very least, but a loose pass from Richard Wigglesworth saw the razor-sharp Saubade intercept and grab a bonus point for the home side.
"To be fair, it will be very hard.
In the 10 years since Burma's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the country has moved very little towards achieving the democratic change she has so steadfastly fought for.
She is once again under virtual house arrest, where she has been since 22 September 2000 after she tried to travel outside Rangoon.
The difference now is that she is allowed frequent visitors, including her sons.
The military authorities did offer to allow her to travel to the United Kingdom to see him on his deathbed.
But she refused for fear that the military government would not allow her back into the country.
She had not seen him for three years.
Ten years ago the Burmese army was still fighting bitter battles against the ethnic rebel groups which controlled much of the country's border areas.
Now all but a very few, particularly the Karen National Union, have signed ceasefire agreements with Rangoon, and the Burmese military now effectively controls the borders.
Burma was also facing growing international isolation 10 years ago, and apart from China had virtually no friends.
Rangoon increasingly relied on the Chinese for military hardware, training and trade - a increasingly close relationship that alarmed the rest of Asia.
Since then the countries of the region have pursued a vigorous policy of engagement.
In July 1997 Burma was admitted to the south east Asian regional grouping, Asean, and India has developed close relations.
The rest of the international community is pondering reducing Burma's international isolation, provided their is substantial political reform in the near future.
The authorities reacted by clearing the universities and sending the students home.
They remained shut for some time, and although the government says the country's universities and colleges opened last year - in effect are only partly opened for fear that students will take to the streets again.
She continued to remind them that her party, the National League for Democracy has convincingly won the national elections held in May 1990.
The NLD has continued to demand that the military junta hand over power to a civilian administration.
She left Burma's military leaders in doubt that she was not going to give up her fight to see democracy restored to Burma.
It was partly this continuous confrontation between the military and Aung San Suu Kyi, along with growing pressure from Burma's neighbours - especially Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and an escalating economic crisis which led Burma's Generals to feel that they had to find a way to accommodate the opposition leader.
For more than a year now the military junta and Aung San Suu Kyi have engaged in what has become called a dialogue process.
"It's a process of confidence-building and a preliminary to actual talks," the NLD spokesman U Lwin told BBC.
It a process that has been facilitated by the UN envoy for Burma, the Malaysian diplomat Razali Ismail.
He has made six visits to Rangoon in the past 18 months encouraging the two sides to talk to each other.
While the two sides have not had face-to-face discussions, although the intelligence chief Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt has meet Aung San Suu Kyi twice in the last 12 months, substantial progress has been made.
While Aung San Suu Kyi's uncompromising determination has helped her stand up to the Generals, it has not always endeared her to all her supporters.
There have been some in the NLD over the last six years who felt she has too autocratic style of leadership and should have been more conciliatory towards the military much earlier.
She has of course dismissed these allegations saying that the military junta had declared war on the party and that centralised leadership was sometimes needed as a matter of survival.
On the face of it at least, Burma - 10 years after Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize - has not changed much, and is no nearer having truly democratic institutions.
But in reality the situation has changed - "qualitative rather than quantitative" according to diplomats and frequent visitors to Burma.
Ten years ago there was no prospect of political reform, now at least there is hope.
The firm announced that anti-retroviral therapy (ART) would be provided where clinically necessary at company expense, and said it would consult with trade unions and the South African government on implementation.
Anglo is one of the first big firms in the country unilaterally to adopt free in-house treatment for HIV-positive employees, who it says account for 23% of its 90,000-strong southern African workforce.
The firm said implementing the programme would cost 1,700 rand (�103; $161) per month per participating employee.
An earlier study by subsidiary Anglogold calculated that appropriate health measures would add $4-6 - or up to 2% - to the cost of producing an ounce of gold.
Combined with the natural reluctance of some workers to come forward to be tested, the firm said it expected participation in the programme to be about 13%.
Anglo has tended to win high praise from campaigners, who are relying on unilateral initiatives from companies to lead the way.
Aids campaigners argue that the South African government has been slow to develop a strategy on HIV, despite the scale of the epidemic in the country.
But the company's fears over the costs of a complete ART programme roll-out have so far prevented it from doing much more than acknowledging the problem.
Other multinationals in South Africa, notably Coca-Cola, have been attacked for failing to meet promises on on HIV treatments.
Sales of all formats in America dropped by 10% over the last year, and the number of CDs sold in Germany fell by the same proportion, new figures show.
The British market has gone against the trend, with recent figures showing strong growth in the albums market.
Music industry officials in America and Germany have pointed the finger at the rise of CD "burning" - or copying songs onto blank CDs - as a cause of the problem.
Their criticism comes after a victory in the online arena, after record companies blamed free online song-swapping service Napster for harming CD sales.
Record companies are now preparing to launch their own paid-for music download services after crippling Napster through legal proceedings.
US figures showed a dip of 5% in CD sales and a drop of 43% in the sales of music bought on cassette.
An industry study found that half of those questioned had downloaded music from the internet in the last month, and 70% of those had burnt the songs onto CD.
Hilary Rosen, head of the Recording Industry Association of America, said she expected the figures to improve by the end of the year.
In Germany, Peter Zombik, head of the country's phonographic industry federation, said the decline in sales was the worst for 20 years.
Some 133 million blank CDs were used to copy music in the last year, compared with a total of 109 million CDs, tapes and records that were bought, he said.
Earlier this month, British figures showed that album sales have risen by 18% in the first half of the year.
The ceremony - American TV's biggest awards of the year - were due to take place on Sunday, 7 October.
Organisers must now decide whether to reschedule the ceremony yet again or cancel it.
The organisers had sought to create a night of mutedcelebration, asking participants to cut back on red-carpetarrival fanfare and forgo showy gowns and tuxedoes in favourof business attire.
The decision to call Sunday's show off was taken after heads of the major TV networks consulted each other.
"I did not speak to one person today from the community who was passionate about going on.
The three-hour ceremony, watched by millions across America, had originally been due to take place on 16 September.
But they were postponed because of national mourning following the attacks on New York and Washington.
If officially cancelled, it will be the first time the awards have been scrapped in their 53-year history.
The only other time the Emmys have been affected by world events was in 1978, when the ceremony was delayed by half an hour because then President Jimmy Carter announced the Camp David Accords.
The singer, 40, is due to stand trial next year after an incident in April when she found a woman sleeping on her ex-boyfriend's couch in Los Angeles.
Kristin King has said an "angry, vicious and erratic" Ms Love threw a bottle and a lit candle at her.
The star is also awaiting trial on two unrelated drug charges.
The widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and former singer with rock band Hole, Ms Love has faced separate charges in five recent legal cases.
In one, she pleaded guilty to hitting a man with a microphone at a New York nightclub and in another, she admitted being under the influence of cocaine.
The charge of assault with a deadly weapon arose on 25 April when Ms Love allegedly poured a bottle of whisky over Ms King before throwing the bottle and a candle at her face.
The singer and actress then sat on Ms King, pulled her hair, dug her nails into her arm and grabbed her left breast in the "worst pinch I ever had", the alleged victim has claimed.
The incident left Ms King with bruises, nail marks, a bump on the back of her head and a chipped tooth, she has said.
Ms Love is free on $150,000 (�80,000) bail and must return to court in Los Angeles on 15 December for a hearing that will decide when her trial will start.
Last month, her lawyer Howard Weitzman said thesinger had been "grossly overcharged".
Opposition protesters took to the streets of the Iranian capital, Tehran, on Sunday in defiance of official warnings of a crackdown.
Police blocked streets leading to the centre of Tehran to try to prevent thousands of people from joining the protests.
It was the worst violence in Iran since the immediate aftermath of June's bitterly disputed presidential election.
Opposition leaders criticised the government for using violence to suppress protests on what was a holy day for Shia Muslims.
Security forces used tear gas to try to disperse protesters but opposition websites said police also fired shots at the crowds.
It appears that the scale of the protests took the police by surprise and they lost control of some areas.
Sunday's protests highlight the simmering tension in Iran six months after the disputed presidential elections.
The unrest coincided with the climax of the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura to mourn the 7th Century death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.
Given the depth of feeling on the streets, it is unclear how this latest crisis will unfold.
Homeless fruit picker Robert Long was found guilty of causing a fire at the Palace Hostel in June 2000.
It killed 15 young travellers, including five from the south of England and two from the Merthyr Tydfil area of south Wales.
Long was sentenced to life imprisonment for two counts of murder and 15 years for arson, with the sentences to be served concurrently.
But Queensland state attorney-general Rod Welford says the judge at the trial at Brisbane Supreme Court was wrong not to take into accountthe deaths of 13 other backpackers in the blaze.
Prosecutors had agreed to charge Long for only two of the deaths to speed up court proceedings.
The move has been welcomed by the father of one of the two Welsh backpackers killed in the blaze.
Natalie Morris, 28, from Cefn Coed near Merthyr Tydfil, was on holiday with her friend Sarah Williams, 23, from nearby Aberfan, when the pair were trapped in the burning hostel.
Her father, Ken Morris, said he had talked to a number of the other bereaved parents and they all felt Long should be held to account for the other 13 deaths.
Organisation Truckersworld says thefts from lorries have risen by 63% in the past year, with most taking place while drivers are parked up and asleep.
Freight crime is believed to cost the economy some £250m a year and drivers say that unless action is taken that cost will be passed on to consumers.
The government says it has carried out research on lorry parking in England.
Truckersworld is lobbying ministers to demand more secure overnight parking.
The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, Geoff Dunning, agreed that theft from heavy goods vehicles was on the increase and often involved violence.
Police blame organised criminal gangs who are often armed with knives and last year 50 vehicles were hijacked by thieves.
In recent years, campaigns have been run to warn HGV drivers about the risks of parking in lay-bys overnight.
Signs in numerous languages have been placed at the most high-risk sites telling both British and foreign drivers of the dangers.
The Department of Transport said it understood the "importance of parking facilities in enabling drivers and operators to work safely and efficiently".
"That is why, last year, we embarked upon research in to the provision of lorry parking in England," said a spokesperson.
Scarletmist, set up by Richard Marks, a Glastonbury regular of 20 years, aims to beat the touts and remind people that the festival is a charitable event.
To date, about 100 tickets have been exchanged on the site - which is getting 70,000 hits a day.
The pace is expected to pick up as the festival approaches and tickets are issued.
"This year I will do Reading and Leeds, and maybe one other festival.
"The aim is to get the site recognised as a free resource throughout the festival-going community.
"It is particularly useful for people who want to sell a ticket quickly - and at short notice," he added.
He stresses that the site is not responsible for any tickets exchanged, but adds that user feedback has been positive.
"I have tried to make the tone of the site sympathetic, to put over the message that there are alternatives, but that people need to be realistic, he said.
The festival runs from Friday 27 to Sunday 29 June, with the gates opening at 0900 BST on 25 Wednesday.
David Perry, for the Crown, said if this was the case there would be little to stop foreign belligerent states from using the same argument.
But Keir Starmer QC, for five of the activists, said the rule of law should apply irrespective of the consequences.
The Law Lords are hearing appeals by 20 anti-war protesters.
Fourteen say they should not have been convicted of aggravated trespass near Southampton docks because they were trying to stop an "illegal war".
Another protester is using the same argument after she was convicted of aggravated burglary for entering RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire.
A further five, who are alleged to have tried to immobilise American B52 bombers at Fairford, are due to stand trial separately at Bristol Crown Court later this year - and their defence will depend on the House of Lords hearing.
The Law Lords are being asked to decide whether a valid defence is available to activists who allegedly broke the law and committed a crime to prevent what they regarded as an even greater "crime of aggression".
The group of 20 say that if you can establish an offence is a crime under international law, it should also be an offence under section three of the Criminal Law Act 1967.
But Mr Perry told the Law Lords it was not their role to "make law".
"We would submit that the power to create laws is no longer a matter, we would say respectfully, for your lordships because there is no authority or mandate for a court to create a law," he said.
But Mr Starmer argued that some of the arguments being raised by the Crown had nothing to do with this particular case.
"The judges aren't creating law in any shape or form.
In earlier hearings, judges have ruled that the courts cannot deal with the legality of the war, which was considered to be a political matter.
The Court of Appeal said that acting to prevent the commission of a crime could be considered as a defence, but added that in reality in cases like this "they were protests and were not attempts to prevent crimes".
Rabinder Singh QC, defending 15 of the group, told the Law Lords, headed by Lord Bingham, that the protesters were being wrongly deprived of a defence which would have questioned the legality of the war and which could have resulted in their acquittals.

With the garden finally coming to life after the severe winter, this fly looked slightly curious to see a camera coming towards it, says Neil Paterson of West Lothian.
This image, looking west over the ruins of Castle Tioram and Loch Moidart, towards the island of Muck, was taken early in the morning by Graham Harris Graham, of South Alloa.
Jim Farish says this spring lamb, photographed on Skye at the broch at Struan, was happy to let him get within a few feet of it.
Rosemary Watson, of Comrie, Perthshire, says she quickly captured this rainbow in Glen Quaich early one morning, when there was a sudden blink of sunshine.
This waterfall at the River Glazert, near Campsie Glen, was shot by Andrew Jack from Edinburgh as he took a break from driving.
Paul Murphy took this picture of his Scottish terrier puppy, Archie, on top of Cockleroy, outside Linlithgow.
This scene at the Skye Bridge was taken by Thelma Edis-Blewitt, from Nethy Bridge, during a bank holiday trip.
Allan MacPhee, who lives on South Uist in the Western Isles took this picture at a beach at Daliburgh during a sunset.
The incident in Glasgow three years ago claimed the lives of nine people and injured 33.
Owners and operators ICL plastics and ICL Tech were fined �400,000 for health and safety breaches.
At question time, Mr Salmond said a comprehensive inquiry would be able to look at the full scope of the tragedy.
The inquiry call, from Glasgow Maryhill Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson, has been echoed by the victims' families, who earlier branded the sentence an "insult".
Ms Ferguson said a full judicial public inquiry was necessary so that all the lessons of the incident could be learned.
This, the former minister said, would "send out a signal that in this country it is completely unacceptable that nine people should lose their lives just because they went to work".
The first minister said a decision on the type of inquiry was down to Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini, but under the 2005 Inquiries Act would be ordered jointly by Scottish and UK ministers.
Ms Angiolini is consulting the families and authorities involved and is expected to reach a decision by the end of the month.

January 2009 will mark the 100th anniversary of the first pension payment, following the passing of the Old Age Pensions Act in August 1908.
And after being in operation for more than a century the system will change in 2012 when personal accounts - the new government-backed, national pension plan - will be introduced.
Whatever your question, Paul Lewis and experts were here to offer advice.

The basic character of the firm was established as long ago as 1976 when Bill Gates clashed with the members of California's legendary Homebrew Computer Club.
This was where many of those that have gone on to shape the hi-tech world first met and chatted about their new hobby and the first popular home computer - the Altair 8800.
Bill Gates and co-founder Paul Allen wrote software for the Altair that actually allowed hobbyists to do something with it.
Homebrew members seized on the software, copied it and freely distributed it - much to Bill Gates' annoyance.
In an open letter to the group Mr Gates decried this willingness to steal.
"Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?" he asked in the letter, signing himself as a general partner at Micro-Soft.
And, because Paul Allen stepped down from Microsoft in 1983, the letter is also seen as an insight into Bill Gates business philosophy.
It helped Microsoft gain control of the market for desktop computers and meant that innovation only happened when it said it could - largely because Microsoft controlled who had access to the way its software worked.
And, as many commentators have pointed out, Bill Gates' dedication to Windows has been a brake on the risks the company has been willling to take.
The rise of the internet and the open source and free software movement has made that desire to protect Windows and use it as the foundation for everything Microsoft does more of a weakness.
It is one of the ironies of hi-tech history that just as Bill Gates broadly succeeded in his aim of putting Windows on every desktop it no longer mattered.
The net, by its nature and founding ethic, encourages a more open and collaborative style of use and software development.
At the same time, people are less and less interested in sitting down in front of the same PC and more interested in getting at their stuff no matter where they are.
Plus in recent years Microsoft has innovated often by acquisition rather than by building technology in-house.
So it is probably appropriate that Bill Gates is passing his role as chief software architect to Ray Ozzie - whose signature work was on software called Lotus Notes which helps people collaborate across a network.
In many respects Bill Gates is an icon of an earlier era and Mr Ozzie is one of the standard bearers of that more open way of working.
And, it has to be asked, if Windows and Bill Gates' are so tightly coupled, if one goes, will the other? Could Windows Vista be the last outing for the operating system?
Clearly Ray Ozzie has some tough decisions ahead.
They said the effort needed to ensure an alcohol licence for the event would take up too much volunteers' time.
Cambridgeshire Police made the appeal to question "the legal position in the licensing magistrates' court".
"Let me make it absolutely clear once again that we are not against the event in principle, and never have been.
"Last year, however, there were 73 arrests, 244 people were given formal warnings for cannabis possession and eight were given penalty notices for urinating in public.
The Strawberry Fair in Cambridge was given the go-ahead by Cambridge City Council despite complaints about drug and alcohol abuse last year.
"This is not an issue on which the police should have been allowed to dictate.
"They unanimously decided that the new look Strawberry Fair should be granted a licence.
The animal, found last August in Bushy Park, south-west London, carried European bat lyssavirus, closely linked to classic rabies virus, tests showed.
The animal was destroyed earlier this month after behaving abnormally.
The virus can be transmitted through a bite by an infected bat, but the danger to humans is regarded as small as treatment is highly effective.
The Health Protection Agency advised anyone bitten by a bat to seek immediate medical advice.
This strain of rabies has been found in six bats in the UK since 1996, in Sussex, Lancashire, Surrey, Oxfordshire and Shropshire, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.
The Liverpool supporters were crushed to death on 15 April 1989 during their team's FA Cup semi-final tie with Nottingham Forest at the stadium.
The city centre siren signalled the two-minute silence at 1506 GMT.
Victims' families, survivors and players past and present gathered at Anfield for a remembrance service.
Sheffield Wednesday FC said its staff would observe the silence.
The club did not hold a formal memorial service at Hillsborough at the request of Liverpool FC and the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
But the Hillsborough memorial on Parkside Road and the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough was open on Wednesday for those who wanted to pay their respects at the stadium.
About 300 people gathered for a brief informal service, held by a vicar in front of the memorial, which was draped with Liverpool flags and red and white flowers.
Many of those at the ground broke down in tears as they observed the two-minute silence.
Those gathered spent time looking at the tributes, before visiting the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.
"What happened that terrible day is something that should never be forgotten.
The crowd will also be asked to observe a minute's silence before Sheffield Wednesday's match against Southampton on Saturday.
With its economy shattered, poverty endemic and political strife and repression widespread, the state once described as an "outpost of tyranny" by the US is probably not at the top of everyone's holiday destination list.
But Zimbabwe boasts one of the natural wonders of the world in the magnificent Victoria Falls, the ruins of Great Zimbabwe and herds of roaming wildlife, and some hardy tourists are still being drawn across its borders.
According to the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, more than 218,000 tourists from outside Africa entered the country last year, some 109,119 from Europe.
One of those who included the country in their travel itinerary was Adrian Wright, originally from Hampshire, who wanted to witness the elections earlier this year.
"I've always had an interest in the economy and politics and it was the most interesting time," says the 29-year-old, on a career break.
Although the shops and shelves "were empty", if travellers have US dollars, supplies can always be bought on the black market which is "working proficiently", says Adrian, who now lives in Australia.
As well as those attracted to Zimbabwe by history-in-the-making, the country's wildlife still acts as a draw for hunters, those on safari and volunteers on working holidays.
"I would have considered it [Zimbabwe] due to what I heard about the variety of wildlife here, although it would have been a harder decision if the project was not here to help," she says.
Although the 21-year-old has experienced daily power cuts, problems with telephone lines, the impact of food shortages and currency difficulties, she admits she has been shielded from much of Zimbabwe's troubles thanks to the protective environment at Antelope Park, in the country's midlands.
A generator on site allows her to "straighten her hair" and internet access means she can update her Facebook page to let family and friends know how she is doing.
"Tourism has slowed to a trickle in the last few years," says Tom Hall, travel editor of the Lonely Planet guides.
"It has been a real challenge for us because not always what the media says is what is going on on the ground," says Felicia Munjaidi, who promotes Zimbabwe tourism in the UK for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority.
The country remains a "value-for-money" destination, she says, and insists Zimbabweans are still "known worldwide as the most welcoming hospitable people".
However, not everyone accepts the optimistic figures quoted by tourism chiefs.
"I don't believe them," says John Robertson, an independent economist in Harare, who states the government is "desperate to express what is happening in more upbeat terms".
Although tourism is probably no worse than it was a few years ago, it cannot be argued there has been a recovery, he says.
But, he adds, the biggest challenge will be restocking the country's wildlife, which he claims could take 25 to 30 years.
The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force estimates game ranches have lost between 80% and 90% of wildlife to poachers, with national parks down almost 40%.
So what of the ethics of visiting a country with such a poor record on human rights and conservation?
Tourism Concern does not advise against going, but says travellers should bear in mind tourist dollars spent at "big international hotels or foreign-owned safari lodges" will not necessarily benefit local people or the wildlife.
He believes visitors will return to Zimbabwe because the country still has what tourists are looking for and this will, in turn, help the country get back on its feet.
Yet, however optimistic some in the industry remain, most appear to agree Zimbabwe will only truly win back its rightful place on travellers' itineraries when it achieves genuine economic and political stability.
Until the Stormont speaker Eileen Bell ruled his assembly alliance with the Ulster Unionists out of order last month, the PUP leader David Ervine might have expected to be attending the St Andrews talks as part of Sir Reg Empey's delegation.
But now - with the link broken - Mr Ervine will head his own delegation consisting of himself and three support staff.
The UVF is suspicious of talk from London and Dublin about increased north-south cooperation if there's no deal - it argues that the loyalist ceasefire of 1994 was based on the assumption that the union was safe and authority would be channelled through a Belfast-based assembly.
So far the UVF has resisted pressure to disband or disarm and the latest Independent Monitoring Commission report found that the UVF leadership had sanctioned a murder bid on the alleged informer Mark Haddock.
That said, the Progressive Unionists have resumed contact with the Monitoring Commission which they broke off in late 2004 after it criticised the party for not using its influence to end UVF activity.
In 2005, the IMC recommended that thousands of pounds in Assembly grants be withheld from the PUP, but the Secretary of State, Peter Hain, continued to pay the cash because of what he called the "role that the PUP plays in attempting to secure peace and stability in the loyalist community".
The PUP is in favour of financial assistance for tackling deprivation in loyalist areas.
Last month, the PUP and Sinn Fein in Londonderry released a joint statement confirming they had "embarked upon a sustained dialogue to develop initiatives based upon common and agreed community issues".
But in a later interview on BBC Radio 2's Jimmy Young show, the deputy prime minister insisted he had the ability to continue at the helm of the vast Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
It said Mr Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has produced policy documents and set up task forces, but had produced few tangible improvements.
It says that millions of pounds have been wasted on management consultants and the department has failed to control spending on the Coastguard Agency and the extension of the London UndergroundJubilee Line.
"This is an inheritance of problems that I have occurred after decade and decade of under investment in public transport.
The deputy prime minister also promised he would respond fully to the criticisms.
The chair of the committee, Gwyneth Dunwoody, said the report, published annually by the committee, had focused on the running of the department and was not a personal attack on Mr Prescott.
Mrs Dunwoody said it was "silly not to pretend" the department had problems.
"We're saying there are a lot of problems and it is silly to pretend there are not.
The report is the latest in series of attacks on Mr Prescott, and came in the wake of the departure of his press chief Simon Dugdale who "stepped down" on Tuesday.
Mr Prescott said that he felt like a fox in open season.
But Conservative leader William Hague said that not even the most cunning fox could snarl up the whole country.
Mr Hague said it was too late for Mr Prescott to use as the excuse that other governments did not do things.

The Heroes Return scheme grants funds to veterans wanting to go back to where they trained or served in action.
Former Able Seaman, George Wells, from Wiltshire, visited the Island twice for a radar training course during the WW2.
The scheme, run by the Big Lottery Fund, has given out around 4,000 grants since it opened in April 2009.
In the Isle of Man only seven grants funding 13 war veterans, spouses, widows and carers have been applied for so far.
The funds, totalling nearly £6,000, have allowed Manx veterans to travel to France, Holland, Italy and parts of the UK.
But time is running out as the scheme closes on 31 January 2011, with trips having to be made by the end of 2010.
Wenger reflects on 13 years at Arsenal
The Frenchman, who this week celebrates 13 years in charge of the Gunners, also revealed how he "questions himself every day" as he strives to improve.
"There are still more targets to achieve, said Wenger, who turns 60 later this month.
A European trophy is the one thing that is missing from Wenger's managerial CV after 13 glorious years at the club.
But having not won a trophy in four seasons, Wenger is determined to bring silverware back to the club and it is this that still drives him on.
"My expectation is to win every single football game I manage and I did not do that, so I can never exceed my expectations.
"I try to assess my performance with what I do and on a positive note, and ask 'How I can be better? How can I improve? How can I get this team to achieve what I believe is in the team?"
"There are still more targets to achieve.
"I believe we have consistently managed to be at the top level, within our resources and improving our structures.
"The club is on a new platform and to reach many more targets.
Ferguson, who has managed United for 23 years, believes Wenger's success is further proof that "longevity brings rewards".
But despite their differences over the physical nature of Allardyce's teams, the former Bolton boss paid tribute to Wenger's achievements with the Gunners.
"Anybody who can get into double figures (in years) as a manger these days is achieving a huge amount of success for their particular football club," said Allardyce.
"I think probably elsewhere, outside England, you are not allowed to do that, but in England, and particularly at Arsenal as the years have gone by, he's been allowed almost total control of the development of the football there.
BBC Newsnight profiles the controversial and colourful career of Argentina manager Diego Maradona.
The Lions pulled off a famous victory in the First Test with a spectacular four-try performance.
Orchestrated by Rob Howley, led up front by Keith Wood and inspired by a brilliant midfield display from Brian O'Driscoll, Graham Henry's men turned the pre-match predictions on their heads.
With three-quarters of the game gone they led the world champions 29-3 - heady stuff even by the distinguished standards of the Lions Down Under.
Tries from Andrew Walker and Nathan Grey cut the deficit to take the Aussies to within two converted scores with 10 minutes to go - but the tourists deservedly held on.
The Wallabies have now failed to beat the Lions in seven attempts in Brisbane.
From the third minute of the game, when Jason Robinson scored in the corner, they never looked like halting that sorry run.
The game - and maybe the Test series - took a decisive turn in the 10 minutes after half-time.
With a slender 12-3 lead the Lions could have been forgiven for going on the defensive.
Instead they ripped into the Wallaby rearguard like men possessed.
George Smith was left trailing in his wake as the 25-year-old crashed over the line to send the 12,000 Lions fans in the Gabba crowd into raptures.
O'Driscoll's Irish team-mate Rob Henderson broke from midfield in mirror fashion and Scott Quinnell was there at the ruck to power in from two yards.
The Wallabies were in disarray, 26 points down after Wilkinson's conversion at a stage in the game when they would have expected to be level at the very, very least.
Some expected the game to start slowly with both sides opting for safety first.
For 120 seconds that was true.
Then the series exploded into life through a man who has still to make an international start for his own country.
The Lions passed the ball flat and fast through to Robinson on the left.
One shimmy and the Sale winger was free, scooting past Chris Latham on the outside and running joyously into the corner.
Wilkinson missed a long penalty and then Martin Johnson decided to run an eminently kickable one as his forwards set up camp under the posts.
Australia held on - just - and battled their way back.
A Walker penalty took them to within two points and soon the Wallaby backs were running the imaginative lines that make them so dangerous.
Wilkinson missed a simple penalty and the Lions momentum seemed to be dissipated.
Then O'Driscoll barrelled off the ruck on halfway and burst Owen Finegan's tackle.
He slipped the ball outside to Robinson who drew Walker, waited, and sent James in at the corner for a wonderful score.
Wilkinson finally converted and there was daylight between the sides.
In contrast to the win in South Africa four years ago, this was a victory built on magical running in addition to tireless work in the tackle.
Pre-match talk of a all-out war proved way off the mark - this was international rugby at its hard-fought yet free-flowing best.
For the two weeks building up to the match you should follow a high carbohydrate/low fat diet.
Make sure you do not start eating foods which you would not normally eat - the last thing you want to do is upset your stomach.
If you do get hungry between meals eat fruit or energy bars.
Remember to drink plenty fluid before, during and after you train.
With just seven days to go until the competition you should have a dress rehearsal of the matchday.
Try to plan and practice your matchday menu (see matchday for details) and see if it fits in well with the competition.
If it works then you will feel more relaxed on the day in the knowledge that the menu suits you.
If not then try something different - perhaps a menu which works well for you in training.
This should include plenty of fluid throughout the day - around 1000ml before the competition and plenty afterwards to prevent you from dehydrating.
Wariness over discussing the subject extends even to showing the film, which depicts the slaughter in graphic detail and also shows the rape of 1000s of women and young girls.
"I think this film can give the chance to - not only Japanese but also other people - to think about the war and history," she said.
The film has still not been screened in the Japanese capital Tokyo and many other cinemas are unwilling to screen it fearing attacks from right-wing nationalists who deny that the massacre occurred.
So far, though, in Nagoya at least, no attacks have been made.
The clash took place near the Kissufim border crossing in central Gaza.
The Israeli military says it hit a group of Palestinians laying explosives near Gaza's perimeter fence.
Islamic Jihad, a radical Islamist group, said the Israeli troops entered the Gaza Strip and fired from a helicopter and tanks.
The body of a 23-year-old Islamic Jihad fighter was taken to a Gaza hospital immediately after the fighting.
A second body was later retrieved from the area, it was reported.
The Israeli military said it believed four militants were killed and claimed they were armed with explosives, grenades and assault rifles, the Associated Press news agency reported.
The Israeli military released a photograph of the weapons it said were found.
Gaza medics said only two bodies had been retrieved.
There has been an unsteady ceasefire since Israel ended its assault on Gaza in January 2009.
Factions like Islamic Jihad have continued to fire rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel.
Last month a Thai farm worker in Israel was killed by a rocket fired from Gaza - the first such death in a year.
Over roughly the same period, about 90 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in a mixture of Israeli military operations and border clashes, according to the UN.
Hamas says it has been trying to keep attacks on Israel in check.
Islamic Jihad said that on Sunday police had detained several of its fighters, along with those from another group, and forced them to sign pledges that they would not engage in attacks on Israel, the Associated Press reported.
The decision by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will mean that embryos can be screened and selected to help sick siblings.
The authority already allows embryos to be tested so families can weed out genetic disorders.
However any change in screening rules is likely to prove controversial and be opposed by anti-abortion groups who question the ethics of embryo selection.
The list includes a handful of people who could already be described as "famous" - such as actors Keira Knightley and Jamie Bell - but most are relatively unknown and from all walks of life.
The youngsters are tipped to make many millions during their careers, independent of any current or predicted inherited wealth.
Top of the list was 19-year-old Carl Churchill, who co-founded DMC Internet in July 2000, using just �5,000 of his savings.
The company, which employs 12 permanent staff, has contracts with the NHS and Department for Education, and has just achieved its first �1m turnover.
Sunday Times Rich List author Philip Beresford, who compiled the list for the Royal Bank of Scotland, predicted Mr Churchill, who grew up in Solihull, would be worth �100m by 2020.
Twins Bryony and Kathryn Frost who are currently ranked the UK junior number one and two for steeplechase and tipped for success in the 2012 Olympics, were also on the list.
Nineteen-year-old Romero Bryan started designing clothes at 13, and has already seen pop singer Samantha Mumba - also on the list - wear one of his creations to the Brit Awards.
It is thought by 2020 he could be sitting on a �30m fortune.
The youngest contender is a 13-year-old female golfer who decided she wanted to go professional at the age of nine.
Henrietta Brockway is a member of Team Faldo, Nick Faldo's select group of promising golfers.
Among the existing celebrities on the list is Star Wars and Bend it Like Beckham star Keira Knightley, 18, who is ranked second with a potential worth of �50m.
British Academy award winning actor Jamie Bell, aka Billy Elliot, is only 17 but could be looking at a �30m fortune by the age of 34.
Footballer Wayne Rooney, 18, was spotted at the age of nine and if he fulfils his potential could have earned �25m by 2020, according to the list.
Another recognisable name on the list is Sam Branson, son of one of the UK's most famous entrepreneurs, Richard Branson.
Excluding any money he stands to inherit the 18-year-old - who is currently modelling for designer Ozwald Boateng - could make �10m in the next 17 years.
Twelve of the contenders went to state schools, and unlike those who feature in the Sunday Times Rich List, they come from all over the country rather than predominantly London and the South East.
The list is a prediction of those who, based on their current performance, will be sitting on a self-made fortune in 17 years.
In fact, due to a drop in the National Lottery sales, the numbers of people gambling fell from 72% in 1999 to 68%.
Commission chairman Peter Dean said more than 99% of adults who gambled did so harmlessly but there were still 250,000 "problem gamblers" in Britain.
Gordon Brown's spokesman said problem gambling had to be tackled.
The Gambling Prevalence Study questioned 9,003 people between September 2006 and March 2007 about 17 types of gambling - from scratch cards to casinos.
It looked at attitudes, the popularity of different types of gambling and the prevalence of problem gambling and followed a similar study in 1999.
Mr Dean said they had been expecting an increase in the number of gamblers, and the amount of problem gambling.
"It was something of a surprise, and a relief too," he told the BBC.
"There have been more forms of gambling available in the intervening years - fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) in betting shops, online gambling and so forth and the overall figures for online gambling are not up.
The National Lottery remained the most popular form of gambling, but the amount of people taking part had dropped from 65% in 1999 to 57% in 2007, the survey suggests.
Participation in all other types of gambling, excluding the lottery, had risen from 46% in 1999 to 48%.
Only 6% of those questioned had used the internet to gamble in the previous year, 3% had used fixed odds betting terminals and 4% gambled in a casino.
This is higher than in Norway, but similar to Canada and New Zealand and lower than Australia and the US.
Professor Peter Collins, director of the Centre for the Study of Gambling, said he would like to see the number of problem gamblers being "a good deal lower", but said measuring them was an "inexact science".
"There are very severe problem gamblers whose tragic situation is quite as grave as any other addiction, but there are people with much less serious problems," he said.
But the Conservatives said one in seven people who took part in "spread betting" were considered problem gamblers and argue new forms of gambling are creating more addicts - yet are most likely to be promoted on TV, under the Gambling Act.
The report will be used to measure the effects of the new Gambling Act, which came into force on 1 September, and brought casinos, bookmakers and online betting under one regulatory body.
It also made it easier to advertise casinos and online gambling sites on the television.
The government said the report's findings were not "grounds for complacency" and it remained focused on protecting children and vulnerable people.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said a review will be carried out into the funding of gambling research, treatment and public education - currently supported on a voluntary basis by the gambling industry.
In July Mr Brown said the government's plan to use super-casinos to regenerate run-down areas would be reviewed, amid fears it could make gambling addiction worse.
"The prime minister said in July that the issue relating to a super-casino is whether or not this is the best way of meeting our regeneration objectives.
That review is due to be published later this autumn and the spokesman said the Gambling Commission's report would be an "important consideration".
The murder of a Celtic fan at the hands of a Rangers supporter brought a violent reminder of sectarianism in Scotland.
In Bankhall Street in the Govanhill district on 29 May, teenager Thomas McFadden was stabbed to death in a brawl.
But for Hutton and Rushford their elation at Rangers' victory during a heated match was not confined to a few celebratory pints and a handful of rowdy soccer songs.
The pair were picked up by police and charged in connection with the death of Mr McFadden, 16.
The bloody event in which Mr McFadden died was one of the sorriest episodes in the history of a religious divide involving the city's Catholics and Protestants.
Football has been its major vehicle of expression.
That event formed part of the background to claims by one of Scotland's leading composers, James MacMillan, that there is still a strong anti-Catholic bias in Scotland.
At Edinburgh University, sociologist Michael Rosie is researching the history of sectarianism in Scotland.
Both Celtic and Rangers have backed campaigns to wipe out the sectarian followings their teams have - but old habits die hard and pleas for tolerance have been shown to fall on deaf ears.
A campaign to eradicate racism from the Scottish game has been more successful and those behind it say education could be the key to tackling sectarianism too.
But for the family of Thomas McFadden it is too late - their son was the latest victim in the tribal warfare which goes by the name of Glasgow football rivalry.
Swansea Labour member Alan Williams has urged churches and leaders of all faiths to set aside part of their Remembrance Sunday plans to call for peace and unity on racial and religious grounds.
Mr Williams emphasised his appeal was not intended to seek an end to the allied bombings in Afghanistan, but to focus people's minds on 11 November - two months after the US terrorist attacks.
The MP is behind a Commons early day motion calling for a "weekend of prayer for peace".
The weekend would include Remembrance Sunday, the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday and the Muslim holy day on Friday.
Mr Williams said he had come up with the idea after talks with Muslims in his Swansea West constituency.
They claimed that - despite calls for racial unity - tensions over the terror attacks and bombings had begun to spill over into racial tension and abuse.
"I am not taking a stance which is anti-war and I'm not part of anypeace campaign," he said.
"I see it as a healing process - a few days in which, in the midst of allthese tensions, we are able to appreciate that our neighbours who have differentreligious beliefs and ethnic origins from us are as concerned as we are aboutpeace for ourselves and for our children.
Last week, Father of the House Tam Dalyell called for a suspension of the allied bombings next month during Ramadan to avoid a "disastrous" backlash to the campaign.

He also followed Prime Minister Tony Blair in apologising to any Iraqis who had been badly treated.
But he cast doubt on pictures published by the Daily Mirror newspaper, which seemed to show prisoners being abused.
The newspaper hit back by saying Mr Hoon's comments were a bid to divert attention from the abuse allegations.
Mr Hoon faced a grilling from his fellow MPs in the question and answer session.
Some of them were concerned that Britain and the US were in danger of "losing the peace" because of the recent abuse claims.
Many MPs were shocked to hear Mr Hoon admit that ministers had not been shown a report about how prisoners were being treated until the abuse allegations appeared in the press.
Remi Korchemny, 73, told a US Federal Court he wrongly dispensed the prescription drug modafinil to an athlete on 4 July 2002.
Korchemny said the substances had come from Balco founder Victor Conte.
Under a plea agreement, the Soviet-born coach will not serve any prison time for the misdemeanour.
Conte and his deputy Greg Anderson have already reached plea deals with prosecutors which look set to result in short prison sentences.
A number of Korchemny's athletes have received bans from athletics, including Chambers and US sprinter Kelli White.
US District Court Judge Susan Illston is due to issue her sentences in the Balco cases on 18 October.
The Bantams went into administration last May after they hit financial troubles following the collapse of the ITV Digital deal.
Administrators were forced to make a number of players redundant as a result and over 30 members of the club's non-playing staff also left.
Former chairman Geoffrey Richmond quit the West Yorkshire club and was replaced by Gordon Gibb last August before the players were paid for the first time in nearly four months shortly after.
The club also struck a deal last August with the Professional Footballers' Association to enable them to receive financial help for two years as they attempted to clear their debts.
In December, the Bantams received an injection of �5m to ensure their survival at least until the end of this season.
They received the much-needed cash boost from the Rhodes family - father David is a club director and son Julian is chief executive.
Meanwhile, Bradford have signed Danish goalkeeper Stefan Magnusson and he willbe on the bench against Ipswich.
The 22-year-old has joined the Bantams until the end of the season as coverfor Aidan Davison due to the injuries to Gary Walsh and Nicky Beach.
Rossi had been banned in a match-fixing and bribery scandal, but he went from villain to hero as Italy beat West Germany 3-1 to lift the title.
Great Britain had three representatives in Spain and Northern Ireland stole the headlines with a sensational 1-0 win over the hosts in Valencia.
However, they crashed out in the second phase, along with an unbeaten England.
This was the first tournament with 24, rather than 16, teams and there were concerns before the event that many of the smaller nations would struggle to compete.
In the event most acquitted themselves admirably, particularly Northern Ireland.
The most bizarre incident, though, came when Kuwait walked off the pitch in their game against France in Valladolid after a row over whether the referee had blown his whistle to stop play.
They were ordered back on by Prince Fahid and France eventually won the match 4-1.
Scotland failed to reach the second stage and, although both Northern Ireland and England qualified, that was as far as either team went.
England, back for the first time in 12 years, topped their first phase group but trailed in behind West Germany after two goalless draws in the second phase.
Northern Ireland finished bottom of their section which was topped by France, who had lost their opening match of the tournament to England with Bryan Robson scoring after just 27 seconds.
The Germans had suffered the ignominy of being on the wrong end of the shock of the tournament, going down 2-1 to Algeria in the opening round.
But they made it through to the second phase after victory over Austria and Chile and went on to meet the French in the last four in a match that produced one of the most controversial incidents in World Cup history.
With the scores level at 1-1, France were denied a likely goal when German keeper Harald Schumacher took out Patrick Battiston with an x-rated challenge.
The French midfielder was carried off on a stretcher but Schumacher escaped a red card.
France took a 3-1 lead but Germany fought back to level the scores, before winning the match in a penalty shoot-out.
In the other semi-final, Rossi scored both goals as Italy beat Poland 2-0, and he was on target again in the final.
After Antonio Cabrini had become the first man to miss a penalty in a World Cup final, Rossi put the Italians ahead.
Marco Tardelli and Alessandro Altobelli made the game safe for the Azzurri, and Paul Breitner's late reply was little consolation for the Germans.
Bishop Luiz Flavio Cappio, 59, made the decision after talks with a government minister in Cabrobo, north-east Brazil.
The government had planned to divert water from the Sao Francisco river to the north-east's drought-prone regions.
Opponents said the idea would benefit only wealthy landowners.
They also said the $2bn project was too expensive, and would reduce the quantity of hydro-electric energy currently generated by dams on the river.
Bishop Cappio announced the end of his hunger strike on the steps of his tiny whitewashed church.
On behalf of Brazil's president, Mr Wagner agreed, as he put it, to extend the dialogue about the controversial river project which led to this hunger strike.
There will now be a nationwide debate about the merits of the project, and the bishop has been invited to Brasilia to meet President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
What the bishop did not get here was the outright cancellation of the project that he had initially demanded.
But his local supporters, who include members of a native Indian tribe, are celebrating what they see as a famous victory.
The markets think the Opec production increase will not be enough to fill the gap.
They were also rattled by an announcement from Statoil that two North Sea oil fields were being closed for technical reasons.
The high cost of oil could threaten the global economy which is still struggling to show any significant growth.
Oil shipments by Venezuela, which supplies 13% of US needs, are still down to about 20% of normal export levels.
Iraq sells up to 2 million barrels per day on the international market, but that would be stopped by a war.
Opec agreed to increase official production after an emergency meeting in Vienna.
"Opec is trying to send a very strong message that it will do its utmost to stabilise demand and supply," said the cartel's president Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah.
However, Nigeria's oil minister said that while Opec was committed to stabilising the price, oil remained cheap compared to other commodities.
Developed countries should reconsider their tax policies if they want dramatic cuts in fuel prices, Dr Rilwanu Lukman told the BBC's World Business Report.
Another Opec meeting is scheduled for 11 March.
Italian opera star Cecilia Bartoli was named best female artist at the event, held at London's Royal Albert Hall.
British conductor Sir Simon Rattle won orchestral album of the year for his recording of Beethoven's Symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic.
The awards, in their fifth year, are billed as the orchestral and operatic answer to the pop and rock Brits.
Terfel won the best album award - the night's biggest prize - for Bryn, which has sold more than 300,000copies in the UK since it was released last year.
Another violinist, 29-year-old Daniel Hope, was named best young British classical performer.
The contemporary music award went to US composer Philip Glass for his soundtrack to the film The Hours.
Russia's Maxim Vengerov won the critics' award for his recording of Benjamin Britten's Violin Concerto and William Walton's Viola Concerto, conducted by his friend and mentor Mstislav Rostropovich.
Guests at the ceremony - hosted by ITV news presenter Katie Derham for the fourth year running - included former boy soprano Aled Jones, actor Nigel Havers and musical star Elaine Paige.
The event, which will be broadcast on ITV1 on Sunday, featured performances from Westenra, Kennedy, fellow violinist Vanessa-Mae and Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins.
American soprano Renne Fleming, the recipient of this year's outstanding contribution to music award, joined Terfel for a duet of Bess, You is My Woman Now from the musical Porgy and Bess.
There were also performances from Amici Forever, the world's first "opera band", and the King's College Choir Cambridge.
Five awards were decided by the Classical Brit awards' voting academy, a body made up of media professionals, members of the Musicians' Union, promoters, industry executives and orchestra leaders.
The album of the year award was decided by Classic FM listeners.
None of us had ever encountered such a living legend, and for lovers of cinema he was perhaps the only true legend who'd ever lived.
At the Actors' Studio he learned better than anyone how to turn into someone else, to become a Mexican revolutionary, or a Hell's Angel, or a New York docker, or a river, or a tree.
After that he wouldn't speak to me for 12 years or so, and he made me suffer terribly, giving me serious doubts about myself and my work.
In the darkness I asked him if he'd ever realised how much I was in love with him.
The murder, outside a radio station in the central Dutch city of Hilversum on Monday, came just over a week before Fortuyn was due to contest the country's general election.
The public prosecutor said ammunition found at the suspect's house matched the calibre of the bullets which killed Fortuyn.
Police also removed environmental literature from the man's home in the town of Harderwijk, 50 kilometres east of Amsterdam.
Under Dutch law a suspect can be detained for 100 days before being formally charged and brought to trial.
Murder is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in the Netherlands.
The court appearance came as the Netherlands was still adjusting to the shock of the murder.
Thousands rallied in the city of Rotterdam, Fortuyn's home and power base, on Tuesday evening to protest about the killing.
Opinion polls had suggested that Fortuyn, 54, would win 15% to 20% of the vote in the 15 May election, with his policy of restricting immigration to the Netherlands gaining him substantial support.
His name will still appear top of his party's list of 52 candidates.
The BBC's Paul Anderson in Rotterdam says it seems likely that the party - which is called Fortuyn's List - will gain from the sympathy vote.
The murder has caused consternation across Europe, with leaders expressing horror that such violence could erupt on the Dutch political scene.
The BBC's Tim Franks in Rotterdam says that many people who marched against the killing on Tuesaday night did so to express their sorrow that this should happen in the easy-going Netherlands, rather than to show political support for Fortuyn.
Fortuyn came to prominence in March when his party made a strong showing in local elections in Rotterdam.
He provoked public indignation by calling for the Netherlands' borders to be closed to immigrants, and by describing Islam as a "backward" religion.
He was shot six times, suffering multiple wounds in the head, chest and neck, and died shortly afterwards.
Fortuyn's funeral will be held on Friday, and his remains buried at a favourite spot in northern Italy where he had a holiday home.
They want the public's views on whether, and how, genetic screening techniques should be used to help couples with serious genetic disorders in their families have healthy children.
However, the HFEA has stressed that it will not re-consider its ban on using the technology to enable parents to make choices about their children on social grounds.
Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is currently used to detect whether an embryo created in the test tube is carrying a genetic defect that will give rise to an inherited genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis.
It can also be used to determine the sex of an embryo in cases where a family is at risk of passing on a serious sex-linked disorder, such as muscular dystrophy, to a male child.
But PGD may also offer some couples greater reproductive choice, enabling them to begin a pregnancy knowing that only unaffected embryos have been transferred.
Four centres in the UK are currently licensed to carry out PGD and one more to carry out the embryo biopsy part of the procedure only.
Approximately 20 babies have been born following 200 PGD treatments in the UK.
PGD was first successfully used in 1990 to produce two sets of twin girls.
It is estimated that everybody carries one or two abnormal genes that could cause defects.
However, the defect will only appear if both parents carry the same abnormal gene.
Anti-abortion pressure group Life said more efficient methods of detecting "defects" would "permit this country to proceed further along the road ofcallous discrimination".
"Life opposes such discrimination before birth and after and urges all people of goodwill to oppose such discrimination too.
"Many people who have a disability lead autonomous and productive lives and are valued members of our society.
A 17-year-old Kent schoolboy has spent just four weeks putting together an encryption method for computer files which could take 30 billion years to crack.
Peter Parkinson's Unbreakable Encryption program is now available over the Internet and illustrates the futility of many governments' attempts to control the use of the technology.
The United States bars the export of such strong encryption without "key recovery", the ability of a third party to unlock and decode encrypted files if, for example, they suspect criminal activity.
The UK Government also wants such keys, to be held by "trusted third parties", so that the security forces can foil paedophile rings, drug dealers and spies, among others.
But an English sixth former appears to have demonstrated the ease with which strong encryption without key recovery can be programmed and distributed.
His key length is 2048 bits, compared to the 40-bit "weak" encryption allowed for export by the US.
Peter admits 2048-bit encryption is more than anybody needs, but it helps to sell the product.
He designed a slick Windows interface for his program and spent four weeks of after-school and weekend work putting an extra step in the encryption of each bit of the RC4 algorithm, a stream cipher technology developed by America's RSA Data Security.
Peter operates out of his bedroom at home in Maidstone, Kent, and plans to set up a registered company when he is 18, although he still wants to continue his education.

Mr Prescott's role in chairing nine Cabinet committees has been stressed when questions have been raised about the deputy prime minister's workload.
Those workload questions followed the ministerial reshuffle in May which saw him lose his own department.
The Cabinet committees Mr Prescott currently chairs include those on domestic affairs and local and regional government, as well as single issues such as animal rights extremism and the Post Office network.
But the government will not say how often Mr Prescott has actually had the task of chairing any of these meetings.
Following the terror alert last week, the Home Secretary John Reid announced he had chaired meetings of Cobra, the government's emergency response committee.
This prompted more speculation about the role of Mr Prescott, who as deputy prime minister is nominally senior to Mr Reid.

The vote seals the United Nations' 15 January deadline for the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to order his troops out of Kuwait, or face military action.
After three days of sometimes heated debate, the House of Representatives passed the motion authorising use of force by 250 votes to 183.
The Democrat-controlled Senate vote was far closer, at 52 to 47, but was not as narrow as had been feared.
It is the first time Congress has approved military action since the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964 at the start of the Vietnam War, and it was by no means a foregone conclusion.
At times the Senate vote was too close to call, and some were predicting the president would be forced to go to war without Congressional backing.
It has also made it clear it will withdraw its support if the war becomes prolonged or results in heavy casualties.
President Bush welcomed the votes, saying they represented the "last best chance for peace" and sent "the clearest message to Iraq that it cannot scorn the January 15 deadline".
He said he had not yet made a final decision to launch an attack on Iraq, but warned it would be "sooner rather than later" if Saddam Hussein did not withdraw.
Senior Washington sources said the president had obtained permission from the British, Saudi Arabian and Egyptian governments to launch an attack at only a few minutes' notice.
The tough line was reinforced by the British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, in Abu Dhabi on a trip to the Gulf.
In a last-minute effort to avert war with diplomacy, the UN Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, arrived in the Iraqi capital Baghdad yesterday with his latest five-point peace plan endorsed by EC foreign ministers.
Iraq continued to refuse to comply with the UN ultimatum for its troops to withdraw from Kuwait, and at 2330 GMT on 16 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began with a devastating aerial bombardment of Baghdad.
On 28 February, President George Bush declared victory.
Kuwait was liberated, but the Gulf War left Saddam Hussein in power.
A democratically-elected government was sworn in after elections in 2005.
However, it has proved very difficult to find an acceptable balance of power between Iraq's national groups, and the country continues to be destabilised by violent extremists.
American and British troops have so far been unable to pull out despite repeated guerrilla attacks which have killed more soldiers than the war itself.

Rival investment groups from China and Dubai were reported to be preparing �1bn takeover bids for the Premier League champions.
The Glazers paid �790m for United over two years ago to complete a takeover that was initially controversial with a section of the club's fans.
But the Glazers appear to have won over some of the United support by backing Sir Alex Ferguson strongly in the transfer market since taking control.
It is understood that an unnamed Chinese consortium approached the club - rather than the Glazer family - months ago to see if the Glazers would be interested in selling United and were told the club was not for sale.
Earlier this year reports suggested that the American billionaire owner Malcolm Glazer was ready to sell United after profits fell short of his expectations.
But the family insisted that they were "committed to the long-term ownership of the club".

Former US assistant secretary for defence Lawrence Korb reflects on the implications in the Middle East.
A charismatic public speaker from a poor rural background, Chen was seen as a steely fighter with a populist touch.
Despite winning a second term in office in 2004, his hopes of building a lasting political legacy were undermined by waning popularity and a series of corruption scandals.
In 2006, following a string of allegations against his family and advisers, he was seriously weakened when prosecutors arrested his son-in-law on insider trading charges in July and then, in November, his wife faced charges of corruption and forgery.
Presidential immunity prevented prosecutors charging Chen when he was in office, but he stepped down in May 2008 and six months later was arrested.
He was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009 after being found guilty on charges of money laundering, bribery and embezzlement of government funds.
He said the charges, and the trial, were politically motivated and appealed against the verdict.
On 8 June 2010 the Taipei District Court overturned one of the lesser corruption charges, saying there was insufficient evidence he had embezzled $330,000 (£205,000) of diplomatic funds.
An appeal against his conviction was rejected on 11 June, but his jail term was reduced to 20 years after Taipei's High Court ruled there had been less money involved in the corruption than previously thought.
Chen has often been a controversial figure.
He was an ardent supporter of independence for Taiwan, but insisted he was a "peacemaker, not a troublemaker", saying he had no plans to declare independence except in the event of a Chinese invasion.
But his often prickly approach towards Beijing, and his Democratic Progressive Party's traditional pro-independence stance, caused some to worry about Taiwan's longer-term stability and prosperity.
China was deeply suspicious of him when he was in office, accusing him of planning constitutional changes that would destroy its hopes of eventual reunification.
Chen Shui-bian's life is a tale of tenacity in the face of adversity.
He was born to illiterate tenant farmers in a village in southern Taiwan in 1951.
As an ambitious young lawyer, he joined a maritime legal firm and married Wu Shu-chen, the daughter of a wealthy doctor.
Chen fell into politics in the early 1980s when he defended a group of pro-independence leaders following a protest in the port of Kaohsiung.
Tragedy struck in 1985, when his wife was paralysed from the waist down after a truck ran over her in what many believe was an assassination attempt on Chen himself.
The following year, Chen was jailed for eight months after losing a libel case involving the ruling party, the Kuomintang (KMT).
But if his enemies hoped to keep him out of politics, they achieved the very opposite.
He became a member of the Taipei municipal council and, after the birth of multi-party politics and the formation of the DPP, became the capital city's first popularly elected mayor in 1994.
When Taipei's voters threw him out four years later, he turned his defeat into an opportunity to run for the presidency in 2000.
His personal success in that campaign was followed by his party's victory in parliamentary elections the following year - the first democratic transfer of power from one party to another in the Chinese world.
Much of Chen's appeal to voters lies in his personal dynamism and his down-to-earth background - many refer to him by his nickname, A-bian.
He has also been seen as something of a maverick.
In 2004, in Taiwan's first televised presidential debate, his opponent Lien Chan focused on the president's character, calling him "capricious," "irresponsible" and "unreliable".
Chen Shui-bian left office in May 2008 when he was succeeded by Ma Ying-jeou, who had campaigned on promises to expand economic ties with Beijing and end the confrontational approach of his predecessor.
The 300 megawatt Qinshan 1 plant in Zhejiang province was shut down last July after what one nuclear safety official described as a "welding problem".
The problem caused bolts holding guide pipes to the main body of the reactor to fall off under strong water pressure, the official is quoted as saying.
He added that the plant would begin producing electricity again next month following repairs.
China has only two operational commercial nuclear power stations but has an ambitious nuclear power construction programme in what is an increasingly energy hungry country.
At present China relies heavily on coal and oil fired power stations but the government regards nuclear power as a cleaner alternative.
The Qinshan plant was the first to have been designed and constructed using domestic resources.
Officials say no one was hurt in last year's accident at the Qinshan plant and there was no leak of radiation.
However newspaper reports in neighbouring Japan have expressed alarm at the delay in reporting the incident.
The national Asahi Shimbun said on Monday that the accident showed "problems in technical standards and disclosure of information as China and other Asian nations are trying to speed up their development of nuclear power plants".
A Japanese Government official has confirmed that Beijing informed authorities in Tokyo at the time of the accident "on condition it should not be made public" but refused to give details.
Under a bilateral agreement China and Japan exchange information on problems at nuclear reactors.
The Japanese official said that Chinese nuclear safety authorities had determined that the magnitude of the trouble was lower than Level Two on the scale of eight set by the International Atomic Enegy Agency (IAEA).
Any incident at Level Two or above has to be reported to the Vienna-based agency.
Its members urged the US Congress to ensure the country was adequately protected against Chinese spying.
The report was published in the same week that US President Barack Obama made his first official visit to China.
A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington dismissed the allegations as baseless and irresponsible.
The report - which says China's spying is becoming more intense and sophisticated - was produced by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
"China is changing the way that espionage is being done," said Carolyn Bartholomew, who chaired the commission.
Col Gary McAlum, a senior military officer, told the commission the US defence department had detected 54,640 malicious cyber incidents to its systems in 2008, a 20% rise from a year earlier.
This figure was expected to jump 60% this year, he said.
Not all these attacks are from China, but China was the largest culprit, the report said.
"A large body of both circumstantial and forensic evidence strongly indicates Chinese state involvement in such activities," the commission said in its 367-page report to Congress.
The report also said that Beijing was building a navy that could block the US military from reaching the region if fighting should break out between China and Taiwan.
The 12-member bipartisan commission was set up in 2000 to analyse the implications of growing trade with China.
The release of the report came as Mr Obama ended his first official trip to Asia, which included several days in Beijing, where he had extensive talks with President Hu Jintao.
Wang Baodong, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, called the spying allegations "baseless, unwarranted and irresponsible".
He called the commission's suggestion that China's navy was being built up to challenge the US in the Pacific a "Cold War fantasy".
Mr Wang criticised the commission for recycling old, unproven allegations and for issuing an annual report "aimed at misleading the American public"
More broadly, the report expressed concern about the practice of reward and punishment practised over foreigners seeking access to China, saying it stifled their freedom to raise questions.
Twenty years after the nuclear incident, it is still not clear what the full effect on people exposed to radioactive materials will be.
Estimates of the number of people who will die as a result have ranged from 9,000 to 93,000 deaths.
But writing in Nature, experts said it was simply too soon to say what the final toll would be.
Sixty-two deaths have so far been attributed directly to Chernobyl.
There have been 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly in children and young adults, resulting in 15 deaths.
A draft version of the UN's Chernobyl Forum last year suggested up to 4,000 deaths could be linked to the incident.
All of this data was from a 1996 study.
Explaining why the 4,000 figure was given prominence in the report, Melissa Fleming, a press officer for the International Atomic Energy Agency told Nature that it was to counter the much higher estimates which had previously been seen.
It is much lower than the 93,000 figure given by Greenpeace in its evaluation of the Chernobyl impact published this week.
Writing in the journal, Dr Dillwyn Williams a thyroid cancer expert from Strangeways Research Laboratories, Cambridge, UK, and Dr Keith Baverstock, an environmental specialist from the University of Kuopio in Finland, said lessons could be learnt from history.
They said the aftermath of the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima by the US was that 20 years is too soon to be able to predict all the consequences of fallout.
The radiation exposure was different in Japan - where the bombs led to whole body radiation.
After Chernobyl, exposure was largely from radioactive particles inhaled or ingested by people living nearby - except for those working near the reactor.
But the scientists say the Japanese Radiation Effects Research Foundation, which was set up to study the bombs' legacy, is a good model for monitoring the effect of Chernobyl.
The thyroid cancers seen have been linked to high levels of radioactive isotopes of iodine.
But radioactive iodine can also concentrate in the salivary glands, the stomach and the breast tissue.
There are already indications that the breast cancer rate in Gomel, Belarus, and other heavily contaminated areas, is double that which would be expected.
Other experts say wrangling over numbers is hampering survivors' recovery.
Louisa Vinton, who manages Chernobyl projects for the UN Development Programme, said myths about radiation had created a "paralysing fatalism".
The mental health of people in the area had suffered, with seven million being labelled as victims of the accident, and aid to the area had created a culture of dependency, which might have encouraged exaggerated fears of ill health among residents, she said.
The worst-hit areas will be radioactive for centuries; but much of the abandoned area will be habitable within decades.
The Chernobyl Forum says the 30-km exclusion zone around the plant is likely to remain in place.
But it suggested that, in other areas, roads should be rebuilt and people encouraged to start up farms and hospitals.

People want to see tighter restrictions around the cosmetic surgery industry to protect patients from some of the more aggressive sales techniques, according to an interim report published today by the NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh's review into cosmetic interventions.
One hundred and eighty people have responded to the Department of Health's review, which was set up in the aftermath of the PIP's breast implant scandal.
The site has been formally declared a Catholic sanctuary, which means that in future it can host religious ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms.
The statue's serene gaze over the city gives little hint of the Herculean effort that went into its construction.
Over 1,000 tons of materials had to be moved up the 700m high Corcovado hill.
Workers began transporting the stone and other building materials in 1922.
The statue was assembled at the top and officially opened on 12 October 1931.
Today the site is visited by more than 300,000 tourists each year, but the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro says it wants to reclaim what it calls the sacred sense of the monument.
So to mark the birthday, the statue was officially declared a Roman Catholic sanctuary, meaning couples will now be able to marry in a small chapel at the foot of the towering structure.
On Thursday hundreds of nuns and priests watched as the site was consecrated at a mass led by Archbishop Eusebio Scheid.
He read out a goodwill message from Pope Benedict XVI describing the Christ statue as a beacon of compassion and fatherly protection.
Investors are concerned that any payment default could prompt a wave of major losses at brokerages across the country.
There are also fears that a shortfall of funds could spill over onto other stock exchanges as well.
The Calcutta exchange was hit by a default of 960m rupees ($20m, �14m) after three brokers were unable to settle their trades, according to the local business newspaper, the Economic Times.
The executive director of the exchange, Tapas Datta, said it will not be known until Saturday whether any brokers have defaulted.
Mr Datta also stressed the exchange had enough funds in its settlement guarantee fund to cover any shortfalls.
The guarantee fund contains 5bn rupees.
Mr Datta also named some of the brokers having problems.
India's stock markets are already reeling from reports of an insider trading scandal at the Bombay Stock Exchange.
On Thursday the BSE accepted the resignation of its president Anand Rathi, following allegations that he had leaked market-sensitive information.
Over three trading sessions at the end of last week, the Bombay market lost nearly 9%.
The plunge contrasted with a trading peak last Wednesday following the release of what was seen as a market-friendly budget in India.
The BSE is also known as The Stock Exchange, Mumbai.
Many Egyptians believe Sainsbury's has links with Israel, something it has consistently denied.
The decision to pull out of Egypt comes as Sainsbury's reports a healthy growth in sales across the group as a whole for the first three months of 2001.
The BBC's correspondent in Cairo, Frank Gardner said Sainsbury's had gone out on a limb in Egypt, which has no tradition of supermarket shopping.
It had faced problems last year, at the height of the Palestinian uprising, when a story went round that Sainsbury's had Jewish connections, a rumour encouraged by local shopkeepers.
Angry mobs had thrown stones at some stores and Muslim preachers had told people that shopping at Sainsbury's was sinful.
Other Western businesses were also targeted including Coca-Cola and Macdonalds.
But the anger had largely subsided, Mr Gardner said, and Sainsbury's failure to exploit such a large and apparently receptive market as Egypt must ultimately count as a management blunder.
"It is a huge blow to British business and a huge blow to ordinary Egyptians who had started to accept that this was the way to shop in the future, rather than going to tiny corner shops who were overcharging them," Mr Gardner told BBC News 24.
Its decision to move into the country - at a time when it was struggling to hang on to its core UK market - puzzled many analysts.
In 1999, the retailer paid �100m for an 80% share of local retailer Egyptian Distribution Group.
But within a year Sainsbury's was saying it was planning to 'dilute' its share after incurring operating losses of �10m.
Sainsbury's blamed the losses on a 'deterioration of the trading environment' in the Middle East and difficulty in obtaining new licences from the Egyptian government.
The food retailer said the sale of the Sainsbury business in Egypt to the company's minority partner will result in a �100 to �125m exceptional loss.
A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said the decision to go into Egypt had been taken under previous chief executive Dino Adriano.
She said the size of the potential market, the quality of the workforce, favourable investment conditions and good relations between the Egyptian and British governments, had all been factors in the decision.
"The situation was more stable when we went in there," she added.
Sir Peter, who was appointed last year to turn the retailer's fortunes around, decided it could not carry on sustaining losses in its Egyptian operations and decided to pull the plug.
It now expects to see a return to improved profitability in the second half of this year.
Sir Peter said the figures, unveiled in a trading update, were the result of promotional campaigns and the impact of stores extensions and refits.
Sainsbury's, which is due to report its full-year results on 30 May, said it had completed the sale of its 22 Homebase DIY stores for �156m.
Sainsbury's is the UK's second biggest grocer after Tesco and has been struggling to stop a decline in profitability and customer numbers.
Tesco is due to announce its first quarter sales and profits on Tuesday, and is widely expected to report profits of more than �1bn for the first time.
Brent crude fell sharply following Saudi Arabia's announcement on Monday that it might boost production by 500,000 barrels a day.
Traders are expecting the Saudis to start pumping more crude oil in the days to come.
However, there are fears that Saudi Arabia could may just have been posturing to bring down the price of oil, and that it will not act without the full consent of its fellow members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).
There have been mixed signals with expectations that other Opec members are about to join the Saudis in boosting production, but a senior Opec official seemed to dampen any hopes of increased production.
Opec President Ali Rodriguez said the organisation would only raise output insisted the cartel will raise production only after full consultations and the agreement of all members.
"The Opec secretary general informed me officially that there was no idea by any country to raise outputunilaterally," he said.
But other sources said that the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Algeria could join Saudi Arabia by increasing supply by an overall 500,000 barrels a day, with the Saudis contributing to the bulk of the increase.
The sources said an announcement was expected within the next few days.
The Saudi oil minister made his announcement only two days after an Opec agreement to increase production by 708,000 barrels a day had come into force.
Opec has committed itself to push crude oil prices down to a level of about $25 a barrel, in an attempt to meet the demands of both consumers and producers.
However, two previous production increases initiated by Opec failed to move the oil price below $30 a barrel.
The news will encourage consumers and politicians in Western governments, who have come under pressure after pump prices soared.
Eighteen months ago, a barrel of Brent crude oil was trading for as little as $10.
Saudi officials fear customers could switch to other fuels unless they act to bring the price down.
There is also increasing political pressure from Saudi Arabia's foreign allies.
In the United States, Vice-President Al Gore reportedly fears for his re-election chances if the Washington administration fails to drive down petrol prices, which have soared to $2 per US gallon.
In the UK, where fuel taxes make up a far greater percentage of the total price, the government has come under pressure to reduce taxes and therefore prices as well.
At the weekend, Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered a "pay up or shut up" message to those campaigning for lower petrol prices in the UK, claiming a cut in taxes would mean cuts in essential services such as health.
In the medium term, Saudi Arabia's decision to increase its crude oil production should indeed drive down prices at the petrol pumps.
But Saudi Arabia is one of the few Opec countries that could actually sell more oil.
Only Kuwait is known too have some spare capacity, while the Saudis have reportedly approached Mexico, a non-Opec member, to see if they could boost output.
It says it has the capacity to fix 6,000 cars a day - meaning it will be a month before this process is complete.
The company has just over 200 repair centres across the country that can carry out the work.
The Japanese car giant also had news on the Prius recall, saying that its service centres had received the software to update the Prius brakes.
No date has yet been set for those repairs to begin, but Toyota said it would be notifying affected owners by letter in the coming days.
The pedal repair should take no longer than 30 minutes to complete, and Toyota says its UK centres will extend their opening hours.
Toyota will prioritise those customers whose cars have been identified as having the fault via the Toyota customer helpline.
Mr Settle urged drivers to contact their local dealer or ring the company's hotline in order for their vehicle to be booked-in for the procedure, which involves a piece of metal being fixed into the accelerator pedal.
The company has said that older models will also be given priority as the fault occurs when the pedal becomes worn.
Prius drivers affected by that recall should also receive letters, but if they are concerned they should contact their dealer or ring the company's hotline.
Meanwhile, in the US, a Congressional committee has cast doubts on Toyota's plans to fix its two acceleration problems.
In a memo to lawmakers it said there was growing evidence that neither Toyota nor federal safety officials had identified all the faults.
The memo cited "substantial evidence" of redesigned floor mats failing to stop the pedals sticking under the mats.
There have been complaints in Japan and the US that the brakes on the Prius momentarily fail when driven on rough or slippery road surfaces.
There have been no reports of any such accidents in the UK.
The Prius recall is expected to send this figure even higher.
Simon Cowell on why he is quitting American Idol.
Bookmakers have already started offering odds - with British journalist Piers Morgan the surprise favourite.
Other contenders include Sean "Diddy" Combs, Quincy Jones and Cowell's former American Idol co-host, Paula Abdul.
Some commentators have snarkily commented that TV network Fox's big new signing, also announced yesterday, was being prepped to take over.
That would be former US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.
American Idol producers will be looking for an established music industry expert with a sideline in withering put-downs.
Cowell's vicious barbs ("you have the personality of a handle" is a personal favourite) carry even more weight in the US, where the other judges prefer a softly-softly "you go, girl" approach to criticism.
With that in mind, it is possible that the quick-witted comediene Ellen DeGeneres, who has just joined the series for its ninth run, may already be being groomed as Cowell's heir.
However, Peter Rice, chairman of entertainment at TV network Fox, admitted it would be impossible to completely replace the sarcastic music executive.
"We're not going to find a Simon clone who can do what he does because he's one of a kind," Rice said.
But the real question is whether Idol and The X Factor can peacefully co-exist.
In the UK, Cowell's rival singing contest, which expands the entry criteria to admit over-25s and groups, effectively killed off Pop Idol.
It led to a protracted legal battle, with Idol's creator, Spice Girls impresario Simon Fuller, arguing that the X Factor had blatantly copied his format.
The pair ended their spat when Cowell agreed to take a seat on American Idol.
But a repeat looks unlikely in the US.
However, industry watchers will keep a close eye on the ratings for both X Factor and American Idol when the two go head-to-head next year.
Both will be screened on the Fox network, with X Factor running in the autumn, finishing just in time for Idol to pick up the reality TV baton in the new year.
Fox executives insisted on Monday that Idol would continue for at least three seasons without Cowell.
"I wouldn't put X Factor on if I didn't think it could exist separately," Cowell said.
Nonetheless, Idol's ratings have fallen in recent years after a peak of 30m viewers in 2005 - although it is still the highest-rated programme in the States.
And Cowell may have another ace up his sleeve - bringing pop star Paula Abdul with him to the X Factor.
UK viewers may also have raised an eyebrow at the timing of X Factor's US launch - which will clash with the show's slot on ITV.
Cowell could, like Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli - who judge on both Strictly Come Dancing and its US counterpart - divide his time between the two shows, clocking up frequent flyer miles as he goes.
However, that would damage the X Factor's unique twist, whereby the judges mentor their acts.
The alternative, of course, would be for Cowell to pack up his acerbic wit and quit the UK altogether.
Although that seems unlikely, it could be the cause of a few stress headaches at ITV this morning.
However there are ways in which you can reduce water consumption without too much effort.
Several specimens have been recovered, including a nearly complete and very well preserved skull.
"This is the most terrific find I have been associated with in more than 25 years of field work," said David Krause of the State University of New York.
The predator, 30ft long, was buried by a flood not long after its death and protected from decay and scavenging.
The finding is reported in the journal Science.
The announcement was made by Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit.
The statement in the Indian parliament marks a major shift for India, which had previously refused to put a figure on its planned emissions.
But analysts say the actual level of carbon dioxide will still rise - but at a slower pace.
The minister said the targets would only be a domestic commitment and would not be legally binding.
He said they would be achieved through measures such as "clean coal" technology in power stations, improved vehicle emissions targets, and better building standards.
But to a Boston jury, Woodward was responsible for the death of eight-month old Matthew Eappen, whom she was looking after in her job as an au pair in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Following her A-levels at the local Helsby High School, Woodward was unsure of her future, so took a year off before deciding on college.
By late summer 1996, Woodward was working for the Komishane family in Manchester-by-the-Sea, 30 miles north of Boston, looking after their eight-month old baby.
She was keen to meet more young Americans, to go out in the city - and to have more of an adventure.
But the Eappens have remained convinced that she was resonsible for Matthew's death.
Chief Inspector of Prisons Anne Owers said much of the poor practice at Northallerton Young Offender Institution had been rectified.
But the inspection also highlighted a need to improve the way the jail helped to resettle offenders.
The prison, which first opened in 1783, processes young prisoners who are about to be released back into society.
Routine inspections are carried out every four years, but officials can drop in at anytime unannounced, which happened at Northallerton in January.
Previous reports had highlighted problems with bullying, poor sanitation and lack of exercise facilities.
Now inmates are able to shower everyday and have access to a modern gym.
"We are acutely aware that when we release prisoners back into the community we are putting them back in contact with the public.
Since the last inspection the prison has transformed from a remand centre to a young offender institution.
The prison currently houses 125 18-21 year-olds, for offences such as burglary, robbery and motoring convictions.
Offenders spend the last five to seven weeks of their sentences at Northallerton.
As well as the new gym facilities, they attend a job club, undertake computer training and literacy classes.
She said the Tories had appeared "unrepentant and unattractive" to voters at the last two elections and were "slaughtered" as a result.
The hard-hitting speech came as party spokesmen unveiled some of the new policies on health and education which the party hopes will help revive its fortunes.
Plans to give more power to parents and radically reform NHS funding are among 25 new policies being promised this week by the Tories.
But it was Mrs May's speech which was the talk of the coffee bars in the Bournemouth conference centre on the first day of the event.
The party chairman surprised representatives with the force of her attack on "feuding and sniping" in the party, and her message that "glib moralising and hypocritical finger wagging" had to end.
She said the Conservatives' base had become too narrow, as had, occasionally, the party's sympathies - with minorities "demonised" by some Tories.
And in the last two general election campaigns - led by William Hague and John Major - the party had been "unchanged, unrepentant, just plain unattractive", she said.
She pressed home her message that the party needs more women candidates - saying its current selection procedure was "hopelessly stuck in the past".
And she said the raft of new policies being unveiled this week would help see the Conservatives returned to power.
The first of those were announced later by education spokesman Damian Green and shadow health secretary Dr Liam Fox.
Meanwhile, widely-trailed plans to give parents and other groups the power to run state-funded schools were announced by Damian Green.
But the message from Mrs May was that policies had to come hand in hand with change - and an end to "petty feuding and sniping" - within the Tory party itself.
The run-up to the conference has seen the party facing damaging attacks on Iain Duncan Smith's leadership.
Mrs May also hit out at those politicians - among them Tories - whose "disgraceful" behaviour had eroded public faith in politics.
Later, Mrs May admitted she was referring to Jonathan Aitken and Lord Archer.
"I think most people know who they were, indeed one or two of them ended up in jail," she told BBC's Newsnight.
Her comments come after days of damaging headlines about Jeffrey Archer and John Major's affair with Edwina Currie.
The call was made by the president of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association at its annual congress.
Delegates backed a motion calling for industrial action if key improvements were not put in place.
The Scottish government said it would not be "diverted" from fully implementing the curriculum by August.
Peter Wright, the president of the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA), told Friday's congress in Peebles that the new Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was "deeply flawed" and not yet fit to be fully rolled out in schools.
He said there needed to be dialogue with Education Secretary Mike Russell, and said the union had ideas for how the problems with the curriculum could be fixed.
The alternative to this, Mr Wright said, was that CfE be abandoned altogether in secondary schools, the consequences of which would be "serious but by no means unthinkable".
Mr Russell last month announced the new curriculum would be brought into secondary schools across Scotland in August.
The changes, already in place in primary schools, are designed to give teachers more freedom and make lessons less prescriptive.
But a survey of SSTA members found that 88% felt they needed additional resources to implement the new curriculum while 90% said the main problem was lack of assessment materials.
On Friday, delegates passed a motion backing a ballot on industrial action if "satisfactory progress" was not made with ministers by June.
They want "clear and unequivocal" information on curriculum structures, a list of the core skills to be taught for every subject area and working groups to develop core material.
General secretary Ann Ballinger said the proposed action would be "short of a strike" - but could see members working to contract.
"I have based my decision on the unanimous advice given to me by the experts on the management board, of which the SSTA is a member and therefore voted for this decision.
Mr Russell said he was "fully committed" to continuing to discuss "real and genuine concerns" with unions.
"However, complaints and demands that show a deliberate misinterpretation of the very heart and principles of the new curriculum will not find any sympathy with me," he warned.
Last week Mr Russell confirmed experts were producing simplified versions of key documents for the new curriculum.
New material will also be published, highlighting examples of good practice in key areas such as literacy and numeracy.
Experts at the Priory, which normally deals with drug or alcohol addictions, say that text addiction is just as big a problem as gambling addiction.
Some people can spend up to seven hours every day texting their friends, and one man in Denmark nearly lost all his money sending messages on his mobile.
Centres will be trying to cure texters in London, Hampshire and Glasgow.
Ken Stewart, from the Priory, said the texters might have "withdrawal symptoms" when their phones are taken away from them.
Texters recently broke a record, when 111 million messages were sent at New Year, twice as many as a normal day!
Aid workers said hundreds of internally displaced people had been moved from camps near Nyala by government forces.
Earlier the UN's chief envoy in Sudan, Jan Pronk, said the action was in "flagrant violation of international humanitarian law".
The army said it had been asked to protect refugees and evict impostors.
Mr Annan called on the government to immediately halt the relocation of refugees and return them from the "inappropriate sites" to which they had been taken.
He also said in a statement he was concerned at the deteriorating situation in Darfur - in particular the kidnapping of 18 people by the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the mobilisation of thousands of Arab militias.
"The SLA and the militias risk sparking a new round of violence that could claim the lives of thousands of civilians," he warned.
Police and army troops surrounded the Abu Sharif and Otash camps near the town of Nyala in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the World Food Programme's Barry Came said.
In the case of Abu Sharif camp, the government said their forces had been invited into the camp after local leaders said there were residents from local towns there pretending to be refugees to get food rations.
There were no reports of any deaths, he said, but humanitarian agencies had yet to regain access to the camps.
"This is part of an increasing pattern of deteriorating security conditions right across Darfur," he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.
The WFP estimates that about 160,000 people cannot be reached by aid workers.
Pro-government Janjaweed militias are accused of driving the region's black African population from their villages, since two rebel groups took up arms against the government in February 2003.
The senior African Union (AU) officer in Nyala, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mejabi, told the BBC the ceasefire, agreed in April, was being violated every day by the government and both rebel sides in Darfur.
Fighting was reported on Monday near Nyala between the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) rebels and government forces.
Further on, road blocks set up by Arab militiamen are preventing commercial and humanitarian vehicles from travelling.
The head of the AU's peacekeeping operation in Sudan, Said Djinnit, said the organisation now has nearly 250 troops in Darfur.
AU mediators have presented the Sudanese government and rebel groups with a new security deal at talks taking place in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to end the conflict.
The draft includes a proposal to make Darfur a no-fly zone - a key demand of the rebels.
Spokesmen for each side said the new draft was better than a previous one.
A total of 2,616 delegates voted for Mr Li, the only candidate, but 200 voted against and 126 abstained, a congress official said.
The National People's Congress also re-elected Communist Party chief and President Jiang Zemin to the presidency, and Hu Jintao was approved as vice president, both almost unanimously.
In recent weeks outspoken dissidents have protested at his candidacy for chairman of the NPC, saying he is unfit for further public office.
But Mr Li's supporters launched a strong lobbying campaign among parliamentary delegates to ensure his election by a strong majority.
Although Mr Li, 69, is moving from the executive to the legislative branch of government, he remains the highest ranking member of the Communist Party's all-powerful Politburo standing committee after President Jiang Zemin.
Surrounding him on the NPC standing committee will be 19 vice chairman, also elected on Monday.
In a statement, the US embassy said it was "disappointed" China had not used the Olympics "to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness".
The authorities say the protesters will be freed by the end of the month.
Before the Games, the authorities said protests would be allowed in three designated areas, but it never approved any of the applications to use them.
And rights groups claimed that some people were arrested as they tried to apply for a permit.
Olympic chief Jacques Rogge said in a news conference that the failure to grant any licences to protest was unusual.
As well as eight US citizens, China's authorities also continue to hold a UK national.
The UK Foreign Office has already urged China to free 41-year-old Mandie McKeown, saying China needed "to respect its commitment to freedom of expression".
Beijing says the activists will be deported on 30 and 31 August.
Several other foreign protesters have already been deported.
Aboriginal lawyer Noel Pearson said the current system had failed and Australia's Aborigines must be encouraged to take responsibility for their own finances, health and education.
Mr Pearson recently said that fuel sniffing was so endemic that "crying infants are silenced with petrol-drenched rags on their faces".
With no job prospects, they turn to alcohol and other drugs, which in turn adds to domestic violence, their leaders say.
The conference, attended by indigenous leaders and senior government officials, focused on how the Aborigines' strong family structures could be used to help build economic independence.
Aborigines, who number around 360,000 people, remain the poorest and least healthy section of Australian society.
But community leaders said welfare cheques were exacerbating, not solving, the deprivation.
Evelyn Scott of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation said welfare had almost totally destroyed Aboriginal culture and an educational process was needed to get them off it.
Another Aboriginal leader, Joe Ross, said the current situation has starved communities of hope.
Israel says the target of the strike was the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, who has been involved in the planning of suicide bombings against Israeli targets.
Israeli television reported that the Hamas commander had been killed, but Hamas leaders insist he is still alive.
About 40 bystanders were also injured in the attack.
Witnesses said a car received two direct hits in the attack in a crowded area of Gaza City.
According to Hamas officials, an aide of Mr Deif, Abdel-Rahim Hamdan, was killed along with a second as yet unidentified man.
Hamas has vowed to step up suicide bombings inside Israel to avenge the attack.
The strike occurred in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood - a Hamas stronghold in the north of Gaza City.
"Suddenly we heard the sound of a big explosion," said Mohammed Hajar, a hairdresser working in the area.
A large crowd gathered at the scene as rescue workers led the wounded to ambulances.
Palestinian officials say several children were among the wounded.
The latest violence brings Thursday's death toll to seven.
Earlier in the West Bank, a 14-month-old Palestinian baby died after inhaling tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers enforcing a curfew in Hebron.
The International Red Crescent organisation says this is thought to be the first time a child has died of tear gas inhalation during the current violence.
Four other people died in clashes across the Palestinian territories on Thursday, including an Israeli officer killed in a gun battle.
The army officer died near the northern West Bank town of Tulkarm in an exchange of fire in which a member of Hamas was also killed.
Also on Thursday, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon defended Israel'ssiege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's compound.
He said wanted men holedup inside the compound are "the biggest terrorists that exist".
Israeli forces invaded and started destroying the compound on 19 September following two suicide bomb attacks in two days.
It has been a bad year for the priesthood.
Hardly a week has gone by in recent months without some new scandal involving a paedophile Catholic priest - or even the odd bishop - emerging somewhere in the world.
Catholic priests are the Pope's foot soldiers.
Normally at the Vatican I am dealing with red-girdled monsignori who hold high office in the Church hierarchy and who are usually keenly conscious of the power structure in which they operate.
But as I watched the thousands of humble parish priests who have arrived in Rome this week to attend the Pope's rally - the men ultimately responsible for filling the pews and preaching the moral imperatives of Church membership - I wondered to what extent they also must be worried about this unexpected turn of events during the first five years of Benedict's papacy.
Some have been doing what any tourist or pilgrim does when they arrive in Rome - a bit of shopping.
In the morning they have been filling the huge basilicas of St John Lateran and St Paul's Outside The Walls, listening to meditations conducted by eminent cardinals about the difficult role of the priest in a rapidly secularising world, particularly here in Europe.
Latin is no longer the lingua franca of the Church because of the decline in Latin studies in schools, so the Italian, German and English speakers were grouped in one packed basilica and the French, Spanish and Portuguese speakers were in the other, with video links set up between the two.
The Church is becoming technologically more savvy and now has a full-time monsignore in its social communications department dealing with new media.
I would not have been surprised to see some priests Twittering.
Also in St Peter's Square this week, I saw a small group of Catholic women campaigning to be ordained as priests, despite the firm refusal of the Vatican even to begin discussions on a subject which has been officially declared taboo by two Popes.
Clad in lavender robes, the women carried banners proclaiming their cause and distributed leaflets denouncing to bemused pilgrims "the scandalous aberration that can be caused by a super-valued male priesthood with forced celibacy".
That was until the watchful Italian police patrolling the square asked them for their passports and politely requested them to leave Vatican territory.
Nearby another small group of angry Catholics were also holding a press briefing.
They were from the main American clerical-abuse victims group, the Survival Network for those Abused by Priests, or Snap for short.
Joelle Casteix, a victim of abuse - not by a priest but by a lay teacher in her Catholic school in California - carried a picture of how she looked as a cute 16-year-old when she became pregnant and had an abortion.
She told me she had successfully sued and obtained $1m (£680,000) in compensation in a class suit against Church authorities.
"Today I can speak about it, but so many victims have had their lives and personalities destroyed by predator priests," she said.
This week's Rome rallies and vigils were intended as a morale booster for an ageing profession which has to work within societies that are becoming increasingly indifferent or even hostile to organised religion.
In still overwhelmingly Catholic Malta last month, I watched Pope Benedict as he listened to a 28-year-old local seminarian express his fears as he entered a consecrated life.
The International Year of the Priest was the Pope's attempt to answer him.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates called the launch a "big day" that would bring a new digital workstyle and lifestyle.
The new operating system (OS) boasts an improved interface and security tools.
But not all PCs will be able to run Vista - Microsoft recommends machines have at least 512Mb of RAM, a 800Mhz processor and 15Gb of hard disk space.
Microsoft has pledged to continue support for XP users until 2011.
But Microsoft could face a backlash from consumers over its pricing plans - with the cost of Vista versions in the US roughly half the price of equivalent versions in the UK.
Prices for the OS in the UK range from about �100 for an upgrade version of the Basic package to �249 for a copy of the upgrade to the Ultimate version of Vista.
In the US prices start from $100 (�52) for an upgrade of Vista Home basic to $249 (�127) for the equivalent Ultimate version.
Ovum predicts that 15% of XP machines will be running Vista by the end of 2007.
"Part of the appetite is 'something new for something new's sake'," said Mr Mitchell.
Mr Mitchell predicted that the new graphical interface, the improved desktop search tools and a promise of more robust security would appeal to many users.
But he predicted some consumers could be confused by the minimum specifications for PCs to run Vista and by the different versions on sale.
Users can visit the Microsoft website to check if their hardware will run Vista and some new machines are being labelled Vista Capable or Premier Vista Ready, for those PCs with higher specifications.
"There's been an attempt to demystify what the minimum specifications are," said Mr Mitchell.
Microsoft's previous operating system, Windows XP, was criticised for having too many security holes and needing constant patching.
Hundreds of fixes were introduced to the machine, including two sizeable improvements called Service Packs.
The firm has pledged that Vista is more robust, but will come under fire if Vista proves to be the popular target of malicious hackers exploiting flaws, said Mr Mitchell.
"It's crucial for corporate reputation and revenue that Vista proves more secure and stable than XP," he said.
The new operating system has been criticised for the way it handles digital content, such as paid for movies and downloads.
Vista is able to downgrade the quality of video and audio if the content owners - such as a movie studio or download service - want the PC on which the media is being played to have specific connectors, such as a HDMI port to connect to a monitor.
Microsoft has defended its use of DRM saying it is only acting on the requests of content rights holders.
On Tuesday, Microsoft also releases its new version of Office to consumers.
Not a shock result perhaps but the technology behind it has a range of other uses.
The company's system reads an anonymous identifier that mobile phones transmit and can then track their movements.
The approach will be useful for research, security and improving services in environments ranging from train stations to refugee camps.
For their first commercial project, the company has studied the movements of shoppers in a UK shopping centre to determine the paths that shoppers take and how long they spend in the centre as a whole.
What that means for retailers is that dwindling numbers might be offset by simply keeping shoppers' attention longer.
Mobiles are assigned a temporary anonymous number by the network called a temporary mobile subscriber identity, or TMSI, which the phone periodically transmits to advise of its location.
As the phone moves through the different regions served by different base stations, that number changes.
The TMSIs can only be associated with a number by the mobile operators and Path Intelligence encrypt the TMSIs that they acquire as an added level of security.
"Those websites will be following and understanding how you're using their site, which pages you're going to, how long you're spending on each page," she says.
A number of research projects have used mobile networks' data to track mobile users within about 50 metres in a process that has been dubbed "reality mining", and there are even commercial services that will do the tracking.
By contrast, depending on how many of their detectors they place in a given space, FootPath's tracking can be done to a precision of about a metre or two.
The company is presently involved in several market research projects.
It has been approached by humanitarian workers in refugee camps, where a lack of central planning means it is often difficult to site services such as clinics where they can be best used.
The system will also be useful for researching the layout of, for example, train stations.
Contraband mobiles operated from prisons are frequently used for crime organised from the inside, and jamming the signal within prisons presents problems for mobile users nearby.
Friends of the Earth Scotland say samples taken by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency at three of Scotland's 60 beaches give cause for concern and a further five beaches are on course to fail.
The lobby group is now urging the Scottish Executive to look again at how it can best meet the UK government's pledges on achieving clean water standards.
South beach in Ayr, Ettrick Bay on the Isle of Bute and Eyemouth have recorded two poor weekly samples and have failed to make the annual grade.
East Sands at St Andrews, Pease Bay, Cruden Bay, Stonehaven and Millport on the Isle of Crumbrae have all had one poor sample and a second will see them join the other failed beaches.
Friends of the Earth Scotland says that, given the government's promise of clean beaches by 2005, more needs to be done to bring Scottish waters up to scratch.
"The government has promised clean beaches by 2005, but given the continuing failure we need to know the details of how they will bring this about.
"Cleaning up the water off our beaches is going to take time and money and the public need to know when the water at each beach will be brought up to scratch.
Sepa's head of policy, Colin Bayes, said that while the water quality samples were not satisfactory, improvement work is being done by several agencies.
All three Scottish water authorities are undertaking sewage improvement programmes including key projects along the west coast, in Edinburgh and central Fife.
Earlier this year, the Scottish Office increased the number of official beaches from 23 to 60.
Each undergoes a weekly sampling to check levels of bacteria.
The findings are then measured against Europe's mandatory and guideline standards.
But trying to get to the relevant results for the charity or Queen Elizabeth's favourite pioneer would take a bit more work.

At least 15 people have been killed and many more injured in a barrage of Hezbollah rocket strikes on northern Israel.
McClaren has been subjected to intense scrutiny as a below-par England have struggled in the Euro 2008 qualifiers.
"I haven't been low, but now we have a break and you want the next game to come," said McClaren as he reflected on England's 3-0 away win over Estonia.
"After adversity and criticism you want to get back on," added McClaren.
And Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick believes the criticism will make McClaren a better and stronger manager.
"I sense that Steve is stronger for having come through the tests of the past few months," said Barwick.
"Some supporters crossed the line with the vitriolic personal abuse aimed at Steve in Barcelona when we played Andorra at the end of March.
After Wednesday's Euro 2008 qualifiers, Croatia and Israel top the Group E on 17 points, with Russia two points adrift and England a further point behind.
McClaren attributed England's stuttering start in the Euro 2008 qualifiers to their disappointing exit from the 2006 World Cup and injuries to key players.
"It was a big hangover from the World Cup and many big teams have experienced that, and we had to get over that," said McClaren.
"We've been hit a lot by injuries, we haven't had a goalscorer, and we've come under severe criticism and possibly, at times, rightly so.
"We've not turned the corner but we're in a far better position now than we were two months ago.
"Now we need five performances like we've had against Estonia and Brazil.
Newman complained during his life time of the phantoms that "gibbered" instead of the real him.
Catholics have always regarded him a courageous person who resisted the pressures to stay in the Anglican faith.
He has been viewed as gay, by Peter Tatchell, and as "irrefutably heterosexual" by the Newman scholar, Father Ian Ker.
He has been celebrated as a champion of papal authority by conservative Catholics, and of freedom of conscience by liberal Catholics.
Today the Catholic Church is about to beatify him, the last stage before being made a full saint.
But there are Catholics who believe that he was spiteful, narcissistic, and arrogant.
Yet whatever these different versions, his most compelling and most neglected reputation is that of a writer.
The impression is of a night and day foundry, an indefatigable, pressurised letting of of steam.
His gifts were those of a prose writer rather than a poet, although his long poem Dream of Gerontius was a best seller and set to music by Elgar.
He strived and toiled in writing to reach out through the medium of cold print to achieve a heartfelt luminosity and personal contact and feeling.
He worked hard for it, all the while conscious of the power of mass publishing that dominated the reading public.
He was convinced that people are not made religious through scientific reasoning, or philosophy, or giant leaps of faith.
Faith, like love, he believed is the result of approaching religion as a total person, but particularly through one's imagination.
And so he strived in his writing to give a total holistic experience of faith rather than proofs based on a a set of cold, abstract, logical proofs.
My book attempts to tell the story of Newman's writing life; and, as a writer, he had many of the failings of a professional writer, not least a tendency to be self-engrossed and jealous of his reputation.
That was the largest amount ever paid by the central bank since its creation in 1914.
The record figure was largely thanks to its attempts to support the financial system throughout the ongoing financial crisis.
The Fed funds itself from its own operations and returns any profits to the Treasury department.
The figures suggest that US taxpayers have, so far, gained money from the US government's action in propping up the system.
Some of the profit has come from interest earned on government bonds and mortgage-related securities - including those of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The emergency lending programmes instituted by the central bank during the last year's financial crisis helped swell the Fed's balance sheet to more than $2tn.
They were designed to keep down interest rates and get banks lending to each other again, hoping to spark an economic recovery.
The Fed could also lose money on its holdings if it sells them at a time when they have fallen in value.
The gallery has unveiled Julian Opie'sportraits of pop group Blur as well as self-portraits by two of Britain's mostimportant female artists, Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas.
Unusually, the portrait - divided into four images - was commissioned forthe cover of the band's greatest hits album and is well-known by fans of the band.
The four images are "digital drawings" of the members of the British band.
Much of Tracey Emin's work is based on images of herself and her portrait is a stark image of herself crouched on the floor in the nude.
An actor, writer, film director and producer, Forbes, who was born John Theobald Clarke, in east London on 22 July 1926, had his heart set on an acting career as a boy.
Despite failing to complete his studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada), he made his screen acting debut in 1948.
Over the next 10 years, he landed supporting parts in numerous notable British films including An Inspector Calls (1954) and The Colditz Story (1955) - but it was not long before the lure of directing and screenwriting pulled him behind the camera.
Forbes worked on a number of scripts before his breakthrough at the age of 33, when he won critical acclaim for his screenplay for Basil Dearden's The League of Gentlemen.
The following year, he wrote one of his most controversial screenplays for Guy Green's The Angry Silence, starring Richard Attenborough.
His directing career began in 1961 with Whistle Down the Wind, starring child star Haley Mills as Little Kathy who finds a wanted man hiding in her family's barn and believes he is Jesus Christ.
The film was later made into a musical by Andrew Lloyd-Webber.
Forbes directed many more films in the 1960s and early 1970s, including The Wrong Box (1966) and The Raging Moon (1971), which starred his wife Nanette Newman.
In 1975, he directed cult horror classic The Stepford Wives, based on the novel by Ira Levin.
In the film, rich suburban men, threatened by feminism, murder their wives and create robotic, subservient homemakers in their likeness.
A remake of the film, starring Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler and Glenn Close, and directed by Frank Oz, was released in the US on Friday.
Forbes was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975, and put his subsequent remission down to a gluten-free diet and a loving wife.
The condition did not stop him directing International Velvet in 1978, starring Tatum O'Neal, and continuing to act, direct and write throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.
Thanks to Kay, who used Amarillo in his live shows, hit TV comedy Phoenix Nights and a Comic Relief video, the 61-year-old singer is back in the spotlight.
His greatest hits album is near the top of the chart and audiences on his first UK tour for 20 years are going as crazy as crowds in his early 1970s heyday, he says.
The renewed interest has come as a relief and vindication for Christie, who has remained a big star elsewhere in Europe after fading from view in Britain.
"It's brought me back to where I feel I belong," he says.
"I've had enormous success in places like Germany, selling huge amounts of singles and albums.
(Is This the Way To) Amarillo was first released in 1971, six months after Christie reached number two with I Did What I Did For Maria.
But Amarillo only got to number 18 in the UK - because, Christie says, everyone bought it while on holiday in Spain, where it spent almost six months at number one.
So its current popularity, backed by a star-studded video fronted by Kay, is belated justice, Christie says.
"When punk came in, it was the death knell for singers like myself," he says.
His original fans are coming back out in force to see him, he says - joined by students, possibly attracted by the kitsch factor, and others discovering him for the first time.
Concerts still involve what he describes as "an hour and 25 minutes of absolute power".
His current 30-date tour, which includes a stint taking in Swansea, Weymouth, Stoke-on-Trent and the Isle of Man in just four days, is "gruelling", he says.
In addition to a parliamentary salary of �49,822 there are a number of allowances which can be claimed by those serving at Westminster.
MPs are given an allowance from the public purse to pay for office costs incurred in the course of performing their parliamentary duties.
They can claim up to �52,760 per year for the cost of secretarial assistance, general office equipment and the employment of research assistants.
House of Commons figures show that this has risen massively since 1969, when MPs could claim up to �500.
However, if an MP sub lets part of his or her office, the rent paid by those tenants should be offset against this allowance.
MPs are also entitled to free stationery and postal services from the parliament, along with free inland telephone calls.
Since 1984 there has been an entitlement to a limited amount of free travel for MPs' staff, who can claim for nine journeys between their constituency and Westminster each year.
MPs themselves receive free travel to and from the House of Commons and while on parliamentary business in the UK, or are able to claim a mileage allowance.
The spouse and children of an MP can also make up to 15 journeys each year from their constituency for free.
There is also an additional cost allowance of up to �13,628 available to backbenchers who live outwith London.
The money is available to cover the cost of overnight stays away from the MP's home.
Up to a third of the annual office costs allowance is available to cover the parliamentary work carried out by an MP on behalf of a colleague who has died, retired or been defeated.
MPs whose time at Westminster comes to an end at a general election are also entitled to a resettlement grant of between 50 and 100% of their salary.
This payment, which is designed to help adjust to "non-parliamentary life", is based on age and length of service.
This principle means all web traffic is treated equally regardless of the type or origin.
The networks delivering large volumes of multimedia content to US homes are feeling the strain, and demanding fundamental changes to the rules underlying the internet.
Internet service providers (ISPs) in America want more control over the pipelines delivering the data to net users.
Instead of treating all information equally, they want to manage their own pipes as they see fit - and potentially charge websites in return for prioritising their traffic and making sure users can reach their site.
Some of the largest internet companies, such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Skype, which formed the Open Internet Coalition, have voiced their opposition.
The coalition say smaller companies should be given equal access to the internet and want the platform to remain fast, open and accessible to all.
Also, these big net players do not want ISPs to control how users access their sites.
Chris Libertelli, US director of government affairs at Skype, said his company was able to get off the ground thanks to openness policies on the web.
Backing to this kind of openness has come from the highest office in the land, with President Obama adding his voice to the debate.
"I'm a big believer in net neutrality," the US president said in a YouTube Q&A session with Americans.
"We don't want to create a bunch of gateways that prevent somebody who doesn't have a lot of money, but has a good idea, from being able to start their next YouTube or their next Google on the internet," he said.
He went on to add that Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shares the view of keeping the internet open.
However, it is the FCC's job to listen to both sides in the debate - and ISPs such as Comcast, Time Warner and Verizon are being vocal in their opposition to proposals to safeguard neutrality.
Verizon points out that doing away with net neutrality rules could encourage more investment in the platform, like its fibre-to-the-home project Fios.
Link Hoewing, assistant vice-president of internet and technology issues at Verizon, said companies want a chance to compete.
"I think that as long as we can do that it's good for the consumer," he said.
ISPs have seen network traffic increase dramatically in recent years, and they feel entitled to share in the billions of dollars generated by Google and others.
Asking consumers for more money is a problem because Americans are used to unlimited service for one monthly fee.
But in the past couple of years there have been various experiments tried out on American consumers.
Time Warner tested a tiered pricing system which it quickly discovered was unpopular with web users.
Tiered pricing trials failed because of low data limits which deterred the use of bandwidth hungry applications.
Another ISP tried to restrict bit torrent traffic and got pages and pages of bad press as a result.
Net neutrality supporters understand that some consumers decide to pay higher prices for faster gaming services.
But they have a problem with ISPs demanding tariffs from gaming services to have their service delivered faster.
This intensely political battle is being fought out in the corridors of power in Washington DC, but the outcome is likely to impact on every American net user.
Hamid Karzai's administration has been accused of corruption
In his first remarks since being declared winner on Monday of August's fraud-marred poll, he also pledged to lead an inclusive government.
And he called on "Taliban brothers" who have been fighting an insurgency against him to "embrace their land".
The Taliban said in a statement it would continue its fight and called Mr Karzai "a puppet".
The Afghan president's comments came a day after poll officials scrapped a run-off vote that had been planned for this weekend.
Mr Karzai's only challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, pulled out of the race on Sunday, after his demand for the sacking of key poll officials he accused of corruption was not met.
At Tuesday's news conference in Kabul, Mr Karzai said he had hoped Dr Abdullah, his former foreign minister, would have taken part in the vote.
The Afghan president's relations with the West have cooled since he was first elected in 2004, amid allegations of widespread corruption in his administration.
On Monday, US President Barack Obama asked 51-year-old Mr Karzai to intensify efforts to eradicate it.
Mr Obama - currently considering whether to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan - said Mr Karzai would be judged on deeds, not words.
"Our government has been seriously discredited by administrative corruption," said Mr Karzai on Tuesday.
But the West has made it clear that he'll be judged on his actions, not his words, and crucial decisions about the level of foreign engagement and troop levels in the country will now depend upon it.
He said he would work with anyone, whether they had opposed or supported him in the election.
But a now-resurgent Taliban - who were driven out of Kabul in late 2001 by US-led coalition forces, paving the way for Mr Karzai to take power - rejected his overture.
The militants, who carried out attacks across the country during the first round, had vowed to disrupt the run-off, too.
In the initial ballot, hundreds of thousands of votes were discounted, including almost a third of those cast for Mr Karzai.
His share of the vote was cut to just under the 50% threshold needed for outright victory, requiring a second round to be held.
Dr Abdullah was adjudged to have won a third of valid ballots in August's vote.
One of the reasons for holding a deciding vote had been to try to restore some legitimacy to the process.
But Afghan election officials said on Monday the second round - which Mr Karzai had been the favourite to win - was being scrapped to save money and for security reasons.
Hundreds of passengers suffered long delays because of a signal failure on the main line into the region on Thursday night.
The Great Western main line from Paddington to Penzance was brought to a halt for two hours when computer failure at Slough caused a complete signal blackout.
Also, Cornwall's main line trains were stopped by a lorry hitting a bridge at St Austell on Friday.
After the signal failure, more than 100 trains were delayed, with passengers diverting via Waterloo to try to reach South West destinations.
Railtrack has said the problem was a rare one and has apologised.
First Great Western described it as major chaos.
All mainline services into Cornwall by First Great Western, Virgin and Wessex were halted temporarily while the St Austell bridge, which had been hit, was checked.
Meanwhile, Virgin's new Voyager trains are still susceptible to salt water on the main line through Devon at Dawlish.
The tracks go along the sea front and tides can result in salt water being thrown over lines, causing electrical systems in the new trains to short circuit.
Virgin said, in general, the Voyagers have not had to be stopped recently.
The company said the problem only occurs when there are high tides with heavy seas and contingency plans were in place if conditions got bad.
The company also said its investigation into the problem will go on for the next eight weeks.
Engineers are determining what modifications can be made to prevent the problem occurring again.
The modifications will then be carried out during the trains' regular maintenance.
So far it has secured only half of �1bn needed for the athletes' village and media centre in Stratford, east London, ODA chairman John Armitt said.
Mr Armitt said funding was "more difficult" but "we are on schedule".
Athletes will stay in the 3,000-home Olympic Village during the 2012 games - the biggest component of the 500-acre Olympic Park - which is being built by Australian firm Lend Lease.
In addition the media centre will house 20,000 broadcasters, photographers and journalists.
Mr Armitt said the ODA had originally expected to already have "quite big sums of private sector funding" for the village and media centre.
"The consequence of what is happening in the markets means that the availability of funding is more difficult," he said.
The ODA expects further deals to be struck by the end of 2008 but it will make up the shortfall from its contingency fund.
Mr Armitt said the fund "was designed for major unexpected circumstances - and this clearly counts as that".
After the Games the village will become part of the overall Stratford City regeneration scheme, which will include a shopping centre and up to 3,300 new homes.
Print out and keep this list of local contacts to hand.
"This is a step in the right direction and a key strategy for England Women," an FA spokesman told BBC Sport.
The players had to apply to be considered for the central contracts and it is understood that there is scope to increase the number available to 20.
Those tied to the new deal will have to ensure availability at all times of the year, which could explain why Kelly Smith, Alex Scott, Eni Aluko, Anita Asante and Karen Carney, who now play in the United States, are not in the 17.
"This is a vital step," said FA chairman Lord Triesman.
"We have worked very hard with the FA board and the Professional Footballers' Association on these contracts over a long period of time to ensure they are right for the players.
"This is a great opportunity for those players who have been successful.
"These contracts will help them to focus on training and playing and, just as importantly, on getting the adequate rest time in between without having the pressures of working a 35-hour week.
The 28-year-old hit a third-round 69 to sit on 12 under, one ahead of former US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy.
The pair, alongside Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia who are both 10 under, completed two holes of their final rounds before play was halted.
Meanwhile, Anthony Kim was disqualified for using a damaged driver.
With rain washing out play on Friday, the players will come back to complete their final rounds on Monday for the first prize of 650,382 euro (�532,000).
But Kim's participation ended in the third round when he caught the club on a sprinkler while walking down the seventh fairway and proceeded to use the driver twice off the eighth tee.
Golfing precedent means that any player who damages a club, other than during normal play, and subsequently uses it or replaces it is disqualified.
"Tapping the club or banging it into the ground isn't under the rules considered to be in the normal course of play," explained European Tour senior referee Andy McFee.
Kim, the world number eight, began the day five strokes behind overnight leaders Henrik Stenson and Garcia, after a second-round one-over-par 73.
He reached the turn eight over for his third round after a triple bogey on the eighth and was eventually disqualified on the 11th fairway.
"I found a rules official and they told me if the club had changed [in appearance] it was a disqualification," he added.
Wilson made a straightforward par at the first hole of his fourth round and saved another at the second after finding sand off the tee.
But the Mansfield-born golfer, along with Ogilvy and Mickelson, all have birdie chances waiting for them on on the third green on Monday morning.
"It didn't do any harm playing the few holes, it was nice and steady," said Wilson.
His absence means a total of 13 of the Springboks' World Cup-winning squad are unavailable for the tour which also sees them play the Barbarians.
Du Preez has a shoulder problem, while Victor Matfield withdrew last week to spend more time with his family.
Other absentees include Wikus van Heerden, Danie Rossouw, Gurthro Steenkamp and Percy Montgomery.
They are due to club commitments, while Clermont Auvergne have refused Springbok captain John Smit permission to face the Baa-Baas at Twickenham on 1 December.
The hooker should be available to take on Wales at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.
Prop BJ Botha and centre Jean de Villiers are missing through injury, while Prop Os du Randt and number eight Bob Skinstad have retired.
It means uncapped duo, prop Wian du Preez and number eight Ryan Kankowski, and twice-capped flanker Hilton Lobberts come into the squad.
The trio were called up after loose forwards Danie Rossouw (neck) and Wikus van Heerden (neck) and prop Gurthro Steenkamp (hand) pulled out of the squad on Monday.
As the entire stadium held its collective breath, Rhona Martin came up with the goods as she sealed gold for Great Britain with the very last stone.
"I don't think it's really sunk in that I'm Olympic champion" said Martin in the immediate aftermath.
"They made my job a whole lot easier.
"It's just fabulous - pretty damn good.
Great Britain's Chef de Mission SimonClegg was among the first to congratulate captain marvel.
"What a way to win a gold medal! Rhona is a very composed and focused woman and it could not have happened to a nicer person.
The election will now have to go to a run-off vote between these two, which is provisionally set for 18 March.
The two men faced each other in run-off elections in 1991 and 1996, winning one each.
Both contenders have been lobbying hard for the support of the many eliminated candidates.
"I will vote for Nicephore Soglo in the second round - I campaigned for a change, and between Kerekou and Soglo it is Soglo who represents change," Mr Houngbedji told reporters on Saturday.
"Nothing can stop the wind of change," he said.
The fourth-placed canbdidate, Bruno Amoussou, who received 4% of the ballot has not revealed his hand.
Benin was one of the first African countries to embrace democracy a decade ago and has since then seen two peaceful handovers of presidential power.
Mr Kerekou, 67, the former dictator turned democrat, has earned himself a nickname along the way - "the political chameleon".
Both men spent this campaign accusing each other of corruption and promising to reduce the price of fuel.
The Malaysian central bank is imposing strict foreign exchange controls, in an attempt to protect the national currency, the ringgit, from further devaluation.
Describing the measures as a last resort, the Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohammed, said the government would set a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit, which would only be allowed to trade in Malaysia.
Following the announcement share prices fell sharply, finishing more than thirteen-per-cent down.
The ringgit has lost nearly forty-cer-cent of its value against the dollar in the past year -- a trend blamed by Dr Mahathir on foreign speculators.
From the newsroom of the BBC World Service
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a joint statement with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing.
The US says the shield, parts of which it plans to deploy in Europe, is key to its own security and that of allies.
Both Russia and China have opposed the plans in the past but this is the first time they have come together to do so.
The US, which wants to locate a radar base in the Czech Republic and an interceptor missile site in Poland, says the system will offer protection against missiles fired from states like Iran and North Korea.
However, the plans have soured US-Russian ties, with Moscow fearing that the system could be used against Russia.
The joint statement from Presidents Medvedev and Hu came as the Russian leader began a two-day state visit to China, part of his first foreign trip since he assumed office on 7 May.
"Both sides believe that creating a global missile defence system, including deploying such systems in certain regions of the world, or plans for such co-operation, do not help support strategic balance and stability, and harm international efforts to control arms and the non-proliferation process," it said.
Russia last month demanded it be granted permanent access to the planned US sites in central Europe, saying it would need to monitor their activities.
This is the first time President Medvedev - who took office earlier in May - has openly criticised the US missile system in the style of his mentor and predecessor Vladimir Putin, correspondents say.
The tone of official Russian pronouncements on Friday, with the notion of "Western double standards", suggests no imminent thaw in Russia's relations with the West should be expected, the BBC's Russian affairs analyst Steven Eke says.
He says that Moscow and China again stressed their shared view of the world based on rejection of alleged American dominance.
The two countries have deepened their strategic co-operation in recent years, even holding joint military exercises, our analyst adds.
After working full-time for 25 years, both as a two-parent and single-parent family, regarding work as a symbol of success and not being a parent I now feel that trying to juggle my different roles has changed the way in which I feel about choosing to do both .
So I feel that the issues in today's programme would look very different if it had been made in another country with a more modern view on parental responsibility.
This programme is a mind-boggling indulgence in gender bigotry.
Why is it implied that the relationship of a mother, with a child, is somehow more profound, meaningful, precious or important than that of a father with a child?

The Rev Peter Mullen, who ministers in the City of London, said he had gay friends and the words were "satirical".
The gay rights group Outrage described the comments as "Neanderthal".
A Diocese of London spokeswoman said the remarks did not reflect its views.
In the same blog, Mr Mullen called for all gay pride parades, which he branded "obscene", to be outlawed.
He also criticised the blessing of two gay priests at a "wedding" performed earlier this year in a City of London church.
The Diocese of London spokeswoman said officials had met Mr Mullen and it had been agreed that the comments should be removed.
Academics at the Centre for Virtual Environments (CVE) have already made models of Liverpool, Chester and parts of Manchester and Salford.
The team, based at the University of Salford, said the 3D models were a good way to show prospective developers how their plans will look.
The idea is backed by regeneration experts Renew.
The 3D technology is being showcased at a university masterclass on Thursday.
"The masterclass will enable regeneration practitioners to develop their skills, enabling them to make best use of these new technologies.

As the preferred bidders, the consortium had to show they could come up with just under �4m before they could proceed.
The chairman of New Fox plc, John Holmes, says that everything is now in place for the consortium to take over the club.
"The potential investors had to follow up their pledges with cash and cheques by this afternoon's deadline and that we have accomplished," said Holmes.
Holmes added that there one or two minor issues to be cleared up over the takeover but he was confident they would be resolved over the next few days.
Leicester have been in administration since last October after building up massive debts of about �50m.
Lineker has invested a six-figure sum into the consortium's fund.
Another former Leicester striker, Emile Heskey, also made a substantial donation to help the group reach their target.
The First Division club are now aiming to come out of administration by mid-February.
Leicester are second in Division One, two points behind leaders Portsmouth.
The 33-year-old centre-half, who has signed a two-year-deal, made 93 appearances for the Hatters before leaving to join Colchester in 2000.
"It's 12 years since I first signed but it seems like it was only five minutes ago, it's great to be back," White told the club's website.
Luton manager Mick Harford is pleased to have secured the services of White.
"His arrival will give added competition and strength in depth to our squad which is what we lacked last season," said Harford.
White becomes Luton's fourth signing this summer after the arrivals of Liam Hatch, Adam Newton and Andy Burgess.
Archive - highlights from Nick Faldo's glittering career in golf
The six-time major winner is the most successful British golfer in the modern era with 30 wins on the European Tour.
"I am more than a little bit humbled to have been afforded this great honour," said the 51-year-old Faldo.
Ex-BBC rugby commentator Alastair Hignell becomes a CBE while cricket's Graeme Hick and Charlotte Edwards, and badminton star Gail Emms receive MBEs.
Inside Sport - Nick Faldo
"I believe I join Sir Henry Cotton as the only other professional British golfer to receive a knighthood so to stand alongside such esteemed company is incredible.
"I should like it if I may to accept this honour as a representative of a sport that has given me so much in my life.
He then successfully defended the title in 1990 with a play-off victory over Raymond Floyd, before winning a second Open three months later with a record-low score of 18 under at St Andrews.
His third Open arrived in 1992, and his final major victory at the Masters in 1996 was perhaps his most memorable.
Trailing Greg Norman by six strokes heading into the last round, he shot a 67 to the Australian's 78 to win by five shots.
Twice a European Order of Merit winner in 1983 and 1992, Faldo also picked up the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award following his 1989 Masters triumph.
In the Ryder Cup he made 11 appearances winning a record 23 points and helping Europe to victory five times and also captained the side in 2008, although the United States eased to a 16½-11½ triumph.
The knighthood follows on from the MBE he received in 1998.
Former England rugby player-turned-commentator Hignell retired from the BBC at the end of last season.
He has devoted much of his time to raising funds to combat multiple sclerosis.
The 53-year-old, who was diagnosed with the disease himself in 1999, also played county cricket for Gloucestershire.
Ex-England batsman Hick who retired from Worcestershire at the end of last season, gets his MBE for services to sport, as does Edwards, the captain of England's World Cup-winning women's cricket team.
Hick scored 136 first class centuries in his 25 years at New Road, and said he was delighted at being recognised.
Edwards, 29, became the youngest player to feature for England when she made her international debut in 1995.
"It's a huge honour and after the amazing year I have had this has topped it off perfectly," she said.
Badminton star Emms, who retired from the sport following the Beijing Olympics, has also received her MBE for services to her sport.
She won Olympic silver in 2004 with Nathan Robertson in the mixed doubles, and bronze, silver and gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
Meanwhile, television cook Delia Smith, who is a director of Norwich City, was awarded a CBE for services to the food industry.
Jamaica's Usain Bolt writes himself into Olympic history breaking the 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m world records and winning three gold medals.
Lloyd not to blame for Davis Cup - Draper
Lloyd resigned after Great Britain lost to Lithuania a fortnight ago - his fifth straight Davis Cup reverse.
Former British number one Greg Rusedski is the favourite to replace him but Draper hinted otherwise.
"It's interesting to hear the feedback we've got from the players - we don't need a big name," Draper said.
The humiliating 3-2 defeat by Lithuania, a tennis nation with a fraction of the resources available to the British game, left Great Britain facing a July play-off against Turkey to avoid relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.
This dire state of affairs prompted Draper, who was appointed chief executive in 2006 and whose own LTA record has come under fire, to ask his "player director" Steven Martens to conduct an internal review.
Martens will present his initial findings to the board on Tuesday, the same day Draper goes before the All-Party Parliamentary Tennis Group - a group of MPs and peers chaired by Baroness Billingham - to explain how the LTA spends the £27m it receives in public funding from Sport England for grass-roots projects.
The panel is expected to quiz Draper about the amount he has spent on salaries, bonuses and pay-offs for a succession of high-profile staff who have been hired by the national governing body only to leave without making much of a difference.
Henman hopes for grass-roots change
Speaking on the eve of his Westminster appearance, Draper said the money spent on the likes of star coach Brad Gilbert and former head of women's tennis Carl Maes was "a very small amount in terms of the bigger picture".
This last comment will come as a surprise to Draper's loudest critics, who have frequently highlighted his failure to meet targets on getting players into the top 100 or boosting the number of juniors competing regularly.
As well as uncomfortable questions about the LTA's spending, Billington's panel will ask Draper for clarification on the targets he is working towards and a progress report on the drive to increase participation in the sport.
For his part, Draper will point to the genuine progress being made on the world stage in women's tennis and at junior level.
He will also flag up a small increase in participation levels in Sport England's last annual review of grassroots sport - tennis being one of only four sports out of 33 to show a "statistically significant increase" in participation in 2007/2008.
Draper said 60% of the LTA's money was directed at grass-roots projects, including "significant investment" in schools tennis, coaching initiatives and new facilities.
On the more immediate issue of appointing a new Davis Cup captain, Draper said Martens had taken "a broad view across players, coaches and parents" but did not reveal which players had been consulted.
It is widely believed that British number one Andy Murray will have a big say in the appointment if he is to be persuaded to play Davis Cup tennis more regularly.
This would appear to rule out Rusedski, who is already employed by the LTA but reportedly does not get on with Murray, while the Scot's former coach Mark Petchey is believed to have an uneasy relationship with Draper.
Murray's current coach Miles Maclagan has been mentioned as a possible candidate but the world number three is unlikely to be keen on losing him and four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist Tim Henman has already made it clear he does not want the Davis Cup job.
Henman told BBC Radio 5 live on Tuesday the LTA must focus on increasing mass participation in the sport.
"There has been a lot of focus on Davis Cup but, for me, that should be the icing on the cake," he said.
On the controversial subject of Murray's commitment to the GB team, Draper defended the current policy of using him on a "tie by tie" basis.
"[Murray] enjoys playing Davis Cup but his priority has got to be winning Grand Slams and major titles - that will get more people playing the game and it will inspire the next generation," he said.
A joint report by several international aid agencies said the mission had had "disastrous" humanitarian consequences.
It said the offensive against ethnic Hutu rebels in eastern DR Congo had caused widespread killings and rape.
The Congolese and international lobby groups said the UN needed to take immediate action to protect civilians.
The Congo Advocacy Coalition report said disarming the Hutu rebels is a top priority - but that for every rebel who has been disarmed this year, one civilian has been killed, seven women or girls raped, and 900,000 people made homeless.
The UN supplies, transports and - in some cases pays - the Congolese government army as part of international efforts to rebuild the country after many years of war.
It is currently backing a government army offensive against the FDLR rebels now based in eastern DR Congo but originally from neighbouring Rwanda, where some of them took part in the genocide of 1994.
Since January, it has also been reported that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, 7,000 women and girls have been raped, and more than 6,000 homes have been burned down in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu.
The coalition urged diplomats and UN officials to discuss the situation during a scheduled meeting in Washington DC this week.
Some of the violence has been reprisals carried out by the Hutu rebels, the report said, but Congolese government soldiers had also targeted civilians through killings, rape and looting.
The report includes satellite pictures of villages in eastern DR Congo taken before and after the government offensive and rebel reprisals.
The pictures show apparently busy villages reduced to abandoned, burnt-out huts.
The coalition said the UN had failed to use its influence to stop the government army employing commanders with a known record of human rights abuses.
Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the UN needed to use its clout.
Conservation officer Malcolm Smith told the BBC that he and a group of other people had tried in vain for an hour and a half to get the whales to sea.
The pygmy sperm whales had repeatedly beached, and both they and the humans were tired and set to give up, he said.
But then the dolphin appeared, communicated with the whales, and led them to safety.
The bottlenose dolphin, called Moko by local residents, is well known for playing with swimmers off Mahia beach on the east coast of the North Island.
Mr Smith said he felt fortunate to have witnessed the extraordinary event, and was delighted for the whales, as in the past he has had to put down animals which have become beached.
He said that the whales have not been seen since, but that the dolphin had returned to its usual practice of playing with swimmers in the bay.
But the rise in profits fell short of analysts forecasts because of rising costs, currency appreciation and higher investments in sales and marketing.
Wipro offers IT and call centre services to foreign clients and has worked for more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list.
He said outsourcing from Western countries was expected to contribute $422m in revenues in the July-September quarter.
Wipro said it had hired more than 2,000 employees during the quarter, and added 29 new customers.
The company suffered a serious blow in June, when it lost its second top executive in a month.
Wipro is majority owned by Mr Premji, India's richest man.
Britain's leading theatre company, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), has had a shake-up - and the rumpus was immediate.
The changes to the RSC entail job losses and mean abandoning the company's London base at the Barbican Centre.
Theatre union Bectu said it was "horrified" - and some critics were anxious about the future of the illustrious RSC.
It also wants to become more attractive to big-name actors by offering shorter contracts.
The RSC says it will start to choose theatres to suit a particular work, giving it greater flexibility and freedom to innovate - meaning it will say goodbye to a permanent home.
Matt Wolf, Variety magazine's London Theatre critic, says he is surprised at this, and blames a British tendency to blame buildings for theatrical ills.
"There is this feeling that here that buildings are millstones around theatre company's necks," he says.
And it should be remembered that the Barbican was built specifically to RSC specifications, though that was a long time ago.
At least the Barbican does not seem overly bothered at being abandoned.
Barbican managing director John Tusa welcomed the plan, saying it would free up his stages for popular international events.
This summer The Barbican will welcome Theatre de Complicit�'s latest work The Noise of Time, contemporary plays by Japan's Yukio Mishima and the UK premiere of Robert Wilson's production of Strindberg's A Dream Play.
Bectu has criticised the shake-up on the grounds that both the domestic audience and the large tourist market want the RSC to have a "home".
But Wolf, an American based in London, says that he cannot see the changes having much effect on tourists.
RSC artistic director Adrian Noble is keen to institute a regime of shorter contracts so star actors can join the company for individual productions.
Ralph Fiennes and Kenneth Branagh, both former RSC alumni, have already agreed to perform under the new arrangement.
Given the demand for "names" to win audiences for plays this move is inevitable.
"I know from experience that big stars, but also the more mature actors with families found it difficult to take RSC two-year contracts," says theatrical agent Marina Martin who represents Simon Callow and several RSC actors.
Martin says it is changes in the film and television business that have caused this knock-on effect in the theatre.
"There are so many production companies about, all trying to get a green light on film projects, all of which need a star name on," she says.
In the meantime actors must keep themselves free in case a project gets the go-ahead, and this is true of everyone, not just the stars.
While he welcomes the shake-up in general, what Wolf mourns is the erosion of the repertory system in which a company of actors would perform different roles in a rotation of plays.
"I think audiences love to see actors like Simon Russell-Beale perform in three different plays in a weekend and the RSC did that uniquely well," he says.
"As wonderful as the repertory system is, it rules out better known actors getting involved as they have other commitments," she says.
Whatsonstage recently conducted a survey of theatre audiences who said they were tired of TV and pop stars who drop out of leading stage productions.
She feels that while keen theatre-goers are cynical of gimmicky star casting, a classical name can pull in a big audience.
"I think a shake-up at the RSC was long overdue and we'll have to see how it is implemented, but this is not about glitzy style over substance," she says.
Nobody doubts the calibre of classically trained British actors, and particularly those of the RSC.
If Noble can now attract other former alumni like Michael Gambon, Juliet Stevenson, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart and Emily Watson to join Fiennes and Branagh, there will not be any complaints.
The star thanked the label's executives and called his time at Def Jam a "unique and fulfilling experience".
During his time at Def Jam he signed artists including Rihanna and Ne Yo.
He remained with the label after stepping down as CEO last year and struck a deal worth a reported $150m (£95m) with concert giant Live Nation, that includes touring, publishing and albums for the next decade.
"Working with Doug Morris and LA Reid has been a unique and fulfilling experience and I respect them immensely," he said.
"Doug and I spoke directly and had one of the most unique 'negotiations' ever.
Jay-Z has since created a new record label and has been working on a new album, Blueprint 3, with Kanye West since 2008.
Police would save time and money if they got rid of live identity parades and showed witnesses a video line-up instead, according to new research.
The practice is fairer to non-white suspects and also costs less money, said Tim Valentine of Goldsmiths College, University of London.
Speaking at the British Association Festival of Science in Glasgow, the psychology professor said the fairness of identity parades had been measured for the first time.
The construction of video line-ups made them fairer for African-Caribbean suspects, he said, possibly because people from ethnic minorities were less willing to stand on parades.
"More of the volunteers for the videos are a better fit to the description that the witness gave, so there is less probability of picking someone purely by chance rather than from memory," he said.
Professor Valentine argues that the use of video avoids the need for a witness to be in the presence of the suspect, thus reducing witness anxiety.
It also saves money on paying volunteers for each parade and reduces the cost of parades that have to be cancelled because the suspect on bail fails to attend.
Professor Valentine has been working with West Yorkshire Police, who have been piloting a video system of identity parades since 1996.
Instead of a witness or victim turning up at a police station to look at a suspect and nine volunteers lined up next to each other, they get to look at a 20 second video line-up before making a decision.
The video shows a head-and-shoulder shot of the suspect together with eight or more images pulled from a video database.
Professor Valentine knows of 40 cases using this method that have led to convictions using video identifications.
In 1996, the cost of identity parades was �14m, with half of these cancelled at short notice, he said.
The Home Office is reviewing current codes of practice.
The people of Sipson and their near-neighbours have campaigned for years to keep developers away from the quiet village where just a handful of shops serve the estimated 2,000 inhabitants.
The BBC's Dhruti Shah asked local people for their views on the plans.
"My dad, Vinod, attends the public meetings and we've got to know our neighbours a lot better because of it.
"The plans galvanised me to take part in the Climate Change Camp and the Greenpeace Make a NOise protests last year.
She said she understood BAA had to make profits but was now more aware of the potential environmental risks.
Geraldine Nicholson is chair of the No Third Runway Action Group (NoTrag).
The organisation is funded by Hillingdon Council and represents people living in the London borough.
A thorn in the side of BAA, the 39-year-old says she will not back down from the fight against the expansion until she gets a legally binding promise it will never happen.
Her home, in Little Benty, is just over 500m from the proposed runway and she is concerned about how this will affect her three young children.
Despite its century-old history, Heathrow Primary School will be demolished and the 350 pupils sent elsewhere if the developers have their way.
Assistant head teacher Alison Lee said the school in Harmondsworth Lane had to retain a non-political stance but it would be a "waste" of an "oversubscribed school with a fantastic reputation" if it did get paved over.
She said the school had continued with its own growth plans and was applying for permission to build new classrooms.
Satpal Arri's daughter Priya, eight, attends Heathrow Primary School.
The 44-year-old said although he did not believe his home in Oxford Road in Harlington would suffer any knock-on adverse affects because of the expansion, he was concerned about the future of the school.
"I work as a delivery driver for a courier company and we do get a lot of airport work but I think the authorities should still look at expanding elsewhere - there's more space around Gatwick Airport and Stansted.
Linda McCutcheon moved to Sipson Road in the village 42 years ago when she married her husband, Terry.
The 63-year-old is chair of the Harmondsworth and Sipson Residents' Association, which has campaigned heavily against the expansion.
"However, there are still plenty of people who see this as their home and, like us, have extremely strong ties to the area.
Guljeet Singh is the new owner of Harmondsworth Village Store, in Harmondsworth's High Street, having taken over the business a month ago.
News of the expansion plans had come as a shock, he said, as the previous owner had not mentioned them.
John Butler, 58, believed the result was a foregone conclusion.
The father-of-four, from Candover Close, Harmondsworth, believes his picturesque village will be BAA's next target.
"We're going to get planes overhead and Terminal Six is going to be at the back of this lovely little village.
Tony Peters, 49, has worked at Exchange Gearboxes garage in Manor Parade, in Harlington's High Street, for more than 20 years.
He has seen his fair share of changes near the airport during that time and is not fazed by the expansion plans.
Terfel picked up the award - his second Grammy - for best classic crossover album at the ceremony in Los Angeles.
Simple Gifts, released on the Deutsche Grammophon label, is a mixture of spiritual and secular songs and includes a duet with singer Aled Jones.
Terfel was unable to attend the 49th Grammys, but said he was "delighted" to win such a "prestigious award".
The singer won his first Grammy for his album Opera Arias in 1996.
Album Simple Gifts includes music from Mozart, Pergolesi, Sondheim and a duet by Welsh composer Karl Jenkins.
In July, Terfel became the second holder of the Queen's Medal for Music in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
He was presented with the medal by the Queen on stage at a special BBC Prom marking her 80th birthday.
The major honours at the 49th Grammy Awards were dominated by country trio the Dixie Chicks, who won best song, best album and record of the year.
Kevin MacDonald has been appointed caretaker boss while no reason has been given for O'Neill's decision to leave after four years in the job.
MacDonald will prepare the side for their Premier League opener against West Ham on Saturday.
In May, Villa owner Randy Lerner insisted O'Neill had pledged his future to Villa in after much speculation over whether or not the former Celtic boss would quit.
Northern Irishman O'Neill has transformed the fortunes of Villa since replacing David O'Leary in August 2006, culminating in an appearance in the final of last season's Carling Cup, their first Wembley final for 10 years.
Lerner had backed O'Neill in the transfer market during that spell but it became clear this summer that similar investment would not be forthcoming.
Former Wycombe, Leicester and Celtic boss O'Neill indicated before the weekend that he was keen to speak to Lerner over how much cash he would make available from the Milner move.
It is unclear at this stage whether the response O'Neill received from the club's hierarchy led to his decision to end his four-year reign at the Midlands club.
Former England manager Graham Taylor, who had two spells as Villa manager, told BBC Sport he had been aware of some unrest at the club during the off-season.
"I'm shocked like everyone else even though I've been aware that behind the scenes that there has been a lack of togetherness," said Taylor, who was in charge at Villa Park between 1987-90 and 2002-03.
Taylor also urged Villa not to rush into appointing a replacement, with the likes of US coach Bob Bradley, Ajax boss Martin Jol and former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson all being mentioned as potential successors.
"It is always a little bit dangerous to rush into appointing a new manager but especially as this is an acute time before the start of the season," added Taylor.
Former Villa captain Martin Laursen said he was not surprised that O'Neill left the club also adding that he did not think his departure would be followed by several players.
"He wanted more than Randy Lerner could give him," Laursen told BBC Sport.
Henman put in a mixed performance for Great Britain in their Davis Cup clash with Austria.
He surprisingly lost his opening singles and doubles rubbers as GB struggled.
But he recovered to win his second singles match against Jurgen Melzer.
Sadly, it was a case of too little too late and it was the Austrians who won 3-2 overall.
Beijing is clearly extremely unhappy at the arms package Washington is reported to be offering Taiwan.
In its first response, China's Foreign Ministry called the arms sales a grave violation of China's sovereignty and a rude interference in its internal affairs.
The arms package being offered to Taiwan will reportedly include four powerful navy destroyers, eight diesel submarines and sophisticated submarine hunting aircraft.
These are the most advanced weapons to be sold to Taiwan by any country in at least a decade.
But while Beijing's initial response is robust it is far from being hysterical.
China may be waiting for Washington to make a formal announcement of the deal before making a full response.
But the measured tone may also reflect relief here that the arms package does not include the most sophisticated weapons Taiwan had been asking for, in particular the Aegis naval air defence system.
Beijing has made it clear the sale of the Aegis system to Taiwan would have been tantamount to Washington declaring a new military alliance with an island that China claims is an integral part of its own territory.
A survey by the British Medical Association of 1995 medical graduates found that only a third (32%) wanted to become GPs.
At present, 55% of fully trained doctors work in primary care.
The number of doctors surveyed who do want to become GPs has risen by 7% since the group was last quizzed in 1998 - but not by enough to meet demand.
The potential recruitment problem is further compounded by the fact that two-thirds of those who wanted to become GPs were women.
"We desperately need many more generalpractitioners in the workforce.
Health Secretary Alan Milburn announced last month that newly-qualified family doctors are to receive a �5,000 "golden hello" as part of a drive to recruit more front-line staff to the NHS.
In addition, new GPs who opt to work for at least three years in a deprived area will be given an extra �5,000.
The study also throws doubt on whether the government will be able to deliver on its promise to increase the number of consultants working in the NHS.
It found that many doctors are facing serious delays before getting on the specialist training ladder.
Many junior doctors were critical of the way they are encouraged to leave clinical medicine for research work in order to progress to the specialist registrar grade (SpR).
About a third of the junior doctors said they found it difficult to obtain a national training number - the mechanism that enables junior doctors to follow a specialist registrar training programme.
Some of the doctors said there were no training places in their region while others complained about being forced to complete a research degree beforehand.
Many felt that spending two to three years in a research post would adversely affect their clinical skills.
"However, it can take up to seven or eight years, and sometimes longer, for juniors to move into higher specialist training.
"The problem needs to be tackled in a coherent way which is why we are so concerned about proposals to dilute national medical workforce planning.
"Research is vitally important to the NHS but it should be undertaken at the appropriate time in a doctor's career and with appropriate resources.
The survey also found that long working hours, sleep deprivation, and a lack of hospital resources wereseriously undermining junior doctors' motivation.
More than a quarter (28%) said they only had a lukewarm or weak desire to practice medicine.
Even among those most strongly motivated, the realities of medical practice are denting their enthusiasm.
The study found that only 68% of the respondentsheld a strong or very strong desire to practise medicine, compared to 85% at graduation.
Respondents also expressed frustration with government proposals for a new consultant contract, especially plans to ban private practice in the early years.
Many felt that having spent five years working 80-100 hour weeks, sacrificing family and social life, that the rewards were no longer adequate.
Mr Winsor says both he and the travelling public have lost patience with Railtrack, and it is now time the company completed the track repair programme.
He has issued an enforcement order requiring Railtrack to stick to its now revised 21 May deadline for completion of the work, the first day of the summer timetable.
Mr Winsor said it was clear he needed to "concentrate the minds" ofRailtrack after the rail operator said at least 16 passengers lines would not beready by the May date.
He warned Railtrack that it could face legal action from the train operating companies if they do not meet that deadline.
Mr Winsor said Railtrack had already missed three self-imposed deadlines for bringing the network back to normal - at Christmas, early in the New Year and the latest one at Easter.
He also called for the publication of the register of Railtrack's assets, and was severely critical of the company's knowledge of Britain's track network at the time of the Hatfield crash.
If the company had known the state of the network, it would not have had to impose 1,000 speed restrictions and emergency timetables which followed the Hatfield crash in October, Mr Winsor added.
He said the setting and then breaking of successive deadlines for the end of this work was leading to "disillusionment".
"Railtrack and train companies must be realistic with passengers and tellthem the truth about when services will return to pre-Hatfield levels," he said.
Detective Constable John Smee said Judge John Gower failed to properly protect the public after hearing how Whiting kidnapped, threatened and assaulted the nine-year-old.
Mr Smee told the BBC that police and lawyers had expected him to get seven years at the June 1995 trial, which also heard how he had attempted to abduct two of the girl's friends.
Mr Gower, now retired, said it was a "perfectly proper, right and just sentence" about which he had no regrets.
But they criticised the decision to release him after two-and-a-half years and said paedophiles should not be released until there was no risk of re-offending.
Mr Smee said he accepted Mr Gower's argument that people cannot be convicted for offences they might commit in the future and that there was no evidence Whiting had planned the attack.
Sarah's parents said Whiting should have been kept in prison longer because a psychiatrist's report at the time of the first case Whiting said there was a risk of him re-offending.
But they told the BBC that they did not attach any blame to Mr Gower.
The couple reiterated their calls for offenders to be kept in prison until it was proven they were safe.
At Whiting's earlier trial, also at Lewes Crown Court, the jury heard how Whiting attempted to abduct the three girls.
He succeeded in pulling one nine-year-old girl into his car, told her he had a knife, and threatened to tie her up unless she submitted to the assault.
The judge accepted submissions by Whiting's lawyer that the attack was spontaneous and not something he had planned.
Judge Gower - who has four young grandchildren of his own - told of his sadness when he learnt of the Payne's tragedy.
Visitors to the station will be given information about the city via Bluetooth posters which activate a text message to phones.
The messages will feature information on events in the city as well as shopping offers.
Stirling's Thistles shopping centre is among retailers who have signed up for the service.
Bluetooth is a wireless connection for phones, laptops or PDAs which can transfer information between mobile devices.
Those coming into the station who have Bluetooth capabilities will receive the text message detailing what is on in Stirling and what offers are available in the shops.
The local authority said the project was aimed at keeping residents and visitors up to date with the opportunities available to them.

The 28-year-old Serbia and Montenegro international had wanted to leave his homeland and had also attracted interest from top clubs in Spain.
That should not be a stumbling block for Rangers boss Alex McLeish, with Mladenovic being a regular with his national side.
"Dragan is the type of player that Alex has been looking for and Jan Wouters went out to see him towards the end of last season and came back with a favourable report," said Bain.
Mladenovic, a late developer on the international scene, is a tall, tough, defensive midfielder with a reputation for goals direct from free-kicks or headers from corners.
He scored the only goal of the game on his Serbia and Montenegro debut against Wales in Belgrade in the Euro 2004 qualifiers.
Mladenovic joined Red Star three years ago and last season, featured in 23 league championship matches, weighing in with three goals.
Meanwhile, Dundee have confirmed that they have rejected a second bid from Rangers for striker Nacho Novo, believed to be around �400,000.
The 28-year-old defender is former Fratton Park manager Avram Grant's fourth new signing at Upton Park.
West Ham say they are also close to signing an unnamed young international who played in the 2010 World Cup.
Ben Haim, who has also played for Chelsea, Sunderland and Bolton, made 24 appearances for Pompey last season after arriving from Manchester City.
The Israeli international missed two months of last season with a groin injury but returned in May to play in Portsmouth's final match of the season, a 1-0 defeat at Everton.
He started his professional career at Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2000 and arrived in the Premier League in 2004, signing for Sam Allardyce at Bolton
Ben Haim joined Jose Mourinho's Chelsea on a free in June 2007 but a lack of first-team chances led to him moving to Manchester City in 2008 on a four-year deal.
After playing a part in Manchester City's Uefa Cup campaign in 2008, Ben Haim ended the season on loan at Sunderland before joining Portsmouth in September 2009.

In an interview with BBC Click's Richard Taylor the pop legend also spoke about his excitement at Barack Obama's election as US president.
The company has stressed the pay-out, which is likely to mean �1m for each family of the seven victims, is not an admission of liability.
The money will come from the collapsed network operator's accounts.
A spokeswoman said Railtrack had decided that the families of those who died in the crash and those who were injured had suffered enough.
"We say that the victims have had enough to deal with andit is time to help them," she said.
The remaining �5m will be shared by the 67 people injured in the crash on 10 May.
Normally, no payments are made after an accident on the railways in whichpeople are injured until the insurers for the companies responsible haveaccepted liability.
But because it has been proving difficult to establish blame in this case, Railtrack agreed with Jarvis, the company responsible formaintaining the points that caused the crash, and West Anglia Great Northern Railway (WAGN), the train operator, to offer compensation now.
The Strategic Rail Authority was also involved in the decision.
Between them, they agreed Railtrack would be reimbursed if another company was found to be responsible.
Railtrack will reportedly start paying out compensation immediately on claimsas they are received.
"We would not want failure to establish liability to cause unnecessary stress to the victims and relatives of those involved.
The crash happened when a WAGN train travelling from King's Cross to King's Lynn derailed just outside the Hertfordshire station.
Broken points were blamed, on a stretch of line which was meant to have been inspected by maintenance staff contracted by Railtrack.
The families of the victims have called for a public inquiry into the crash.
Among them was children's author Nina Bawden, who lost her husband and was herself badly injured.
Mr Paisley jnr has been an assembly member for North Antrim since 1998.
Speaking after he was unanimously selected, he said it was a great honour "to contest this important election".
"I am looking forward to this election and will be asking the people of North Antrim for their continuing support and friendship," he said.
DUP leader Peter Robinson said it was never going to be easy to pick someone to follow an iconic political figure like Ian Paisley.
"But in selecting Ian, I believe the members in North Antrim have picked someone with a strong track record of hard work for his constituents," he said.
Mr Paisley jnr will be standing against his former party colleague, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister in the poll.
At the last general election in 2005, Mr Paisley polled 25,156 votes in North Antrim, giving him a majority of nearly 18,000.
However, at the last European election, the TUV - which opposes sharing power with Sinn Fein - received just over 70,000 votes across Northern Ireland, most of them at the expense of the DUP and it could pose a real threat to a seat its rival has held for 40 years.
The two candidates already seem to be in campaign mode, having traded criticisms and accusations before an election date has been set.
The eight male and two female MPs in the contest tried to win fellow members over by outlining their priorities.
Tory MP John Bercow, the bookmakers' favourite, said the next Speaker must be "an ambassador" for Parliament.
MPs vote in a secret ballot next Monday to choose a successor to Michael Martin who quit over the expenses scandal.
The hustings, organised by the political research charity the Hansard Society, took place in front of television cameras.
It is the first time the election of the Speaker has been subject to such a degree of public scrutiny and the first time the vote will be held in secret.
As well as the hustings, would-be Speakers are publishing manifestos and campaigning in the open.
The candidates then answered questions from other MPs on their proposals for reform of Parliament including changes to Prime Minister's Questions and whether MPs needed such a long summer break.
Mr Bercow said he was the "clean-break" candidate as he had never stood for the office before or been a minister.
"We have to restore trust in politics," he said, adding that he would be an "agent of necessary and overdue change" for Parliament in the wake of the expenses scandal.
MPs must accept all the recommendations of an independent review of their pay and expenses, he said, while Parliament was "profoundly old-fashioned and frequently boorish" and needed modernisation.
Many Labour MPs are said to recognise it is time for a Tory to take on the role after two Labour Speakers in succession and some see the liberal Mr Bercow as the best option.
Tory veteran Ann Widdecombe said the next Speaker had to be "known" to voters and said she had the "vulgar attributes" to help Parliament re-connect with the public.
She is probably the candidate who is best known to the public after appearing in TV programmes such as Celebrity Fit Club and Have I Got News For You.
The former minister has said she wants to step down at the next election and would be "sharply focused" on the role until then before handing over to somebody else.
Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she would be a "healing Speaker" and defended her impartiality after recently standing down as a minister.
She said the next Speaker would have to deal with "tremendous challenges", including the possibility of a hung Parliament, which would require "delicate" handling.
Other people who took part in the hustings were the Conservative chairman of the Commons standards and privileges committee Sir George Young and Liberal Democrat Sir Alan Beith.
Sir George said the Commons had been slow to respond to the expenses crisis and MPs from all parties must unite behind whoever is elected as the next Speaker.
"We simply cannot afford any more divisions," he said.
Sir Alan called for changes to Prime Minister Questions, saying the weekly session too often resembled a "schoolyard" and could be more "effective".
Conservative MPs and existing deputy speakers Sir Alan Haselhurst and Sir Michael Lord both argued their experience would stand them in good stead for the role.
Sir Alan said he would be an "experienced hand on the tiller" during a period of change for Parliament.
Parliament had a "golden opportunity" to reform itself, Sir Michael said, arguing that MPs should be able to put forward motions for debate at short notice.
Veteran Tory MP Sir Patrick Cormack said the next Speaker should show "fearless impartiality" in standing up to the government and the opposition.
The next holder of the Office should "name and shame" ministers who leaked announcements to the media before they were made to Parliament, he argued.
Fellow Tory Richard Shepherd said the Speaker should help "reignite the central purpose" of Parliament to represent the public and defended PMQs as a "spirited occasion".
Labour's Parmjit Dhanda, at 37 the youngest candidate in the race, said the next Speaker should be a "radical" champion of reform not just a "safe pair of hands".
He said he did not want to wait "another 100 years" for the Commons to become more diverse, adding he backed the case for ethnic minority shortlists for MP selection in some constituencies.
Mr Martin's decision to stand down in May, after nearly nine years in the role, came at the height of public anger over claims made by MPs on second homes expenses.
Several MPs stood up to tell him he had to make way for a Speaker who could help the Commons reform itself.
Mr Martin will leave the post on 21 June and his successor will be chosen on the following day.
Solstice directors said Aberdeen City Council's refusal to formally agree to use the nurseries for work placements has jeopardised the project's future.
Aberdeenshire Council has already agreed to subsidise placements.
But the project has said it can no longer afford to take referrals from the city council free of charge.
Solstice provides training, work experience and care for people recovering from mental illness.
It grows plants for sale and maintains gardens and, as a result, is partially self-funding.
The project, on South Deeside Road, has in the past provided a service free of charge to local authorities and community psychiatric nurses referring people.
But its bosses have said that to continue providing enough training and support, it needs to have formal agreements in place which would guarantee that when people are referred to the project the local authority would subsidise their place.
It has already secured this with the local authority in Aberdeenshire but the majority of the people who take part in the project are from the Aberdeen City Council area, which has so far declined to put the agreement in place.
Aberdeen South MP Anne Begg is visiting staff to hear their concerns.
"Without their work at Solstice they could find themselves back in hospital, back on drugs or back in crisis because of the state of their health.
"The city council would have to then provide them with daycare or support.

Six men, all of them Catholics, were murdered by the UVF in the Heights Bar in the village.
Jim Wells of the DUP said totally innocent people had been gunned down at Loughinisland.
He said Sinn Fein could not "have it both ways" and called on them to co-operate with the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).
John McCallister of the UUP said the Loughinisland killings had come at a "truly dreadful time for Northern Ireland".
SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie remembered the Loughinisland killings as "the brutal murder of six of my neighbours".
She said there was undoubtedly collusion in this case and called on the ombudsman to resign.
"I'm no longer certain that the office is independent," she added.
The UUP's Danny Kennedy brought a second matter of the day to the assembly.
Ten Protestant workmen were murdered in the Kingsmills massacre of January 1976.
Mr Kennedy said that the killings had a profound personal impact on him as he had known nine of the victims personally.
He said the leadership of the republican movement had "serious questions to answer" and called on them to give information to the police.
William Irwin of the DUP described the killings as "a squalid sectarian act by a group of criminals" and noted that the HET had said the murders were carried out by the Provisional IRA.
However in 1976, Thorpe found his career brought to a sudden and messy end when he was embroiled in accusations of having conducted a homosexual affair with a former model - and allegedly threatening the model's life.
I was less impressed with Kerry's comments on foreign policy and national security than with his statements about domestic affairs.
I don't think I was the only one, judging from the reaction of the convention crowd.
His focus on his military background was overblown and didn't impress me.
The fact that someone served in the armed forces, even with distinction, doesn't mean they'll make a good president, or even a mediocre one.
Besides, every candidate I can remember has promised to keep America strong and safe.
It's like saying the sky is blue.
Kerry promised that he would and I was very surprised to hear it, since that kind of talk invariably invites charges of "class warfare" from Republicans and the corporate class.
That took courage and is certainly something I don't expect to hear the Republicans espousing.
Yellow school buses are as American as apple pie or hamburgers.
Before they move off, drivers like Eric Witherspoon go through their series of morning safety checks.
He walks through the bus, checking that the seats are properly tightened and upright.
"You don't want them falling out of their chairs," he said.
Out for his first run of the morning is the driver everyone knows as George W, Wallstram that is.
Like most of the drivers at the First Student Bus Company, he genuinely seems to enjoy the work.
As he picks up his first child, he wishes the boy a good morning.
As the big yellow bus, now filled with students, arrives at school, English born teacher Christine Amiss pays tribute to what she sees as a great American tradition.
"It really is a symbol of students getting to the school building in a safe and orderly manner," she added.
And if it works in America, why not in Britain?
That is the thinking of Muir Lockhead, Chief Executive Officer of the British private transport giant, First Group UK.
"It's got a world reputation for being the more secure way of taking children to school, and in the UK of course, traffic congestion at peak times, 20% of that is attributed to children going to school in their parents' cars," Mr Lockhead said.
But, is this simply an American gimmick for making more money?
The safety record is certainly impressive.
Each year in the US some half a million school buses travel carry more than 23 million children to school with an average of less than 10 deaths.
As for their discerning young passengers, their attitude towards the buses is mixed.
"It's fun to ride a bus because you have friends to sit next to," said one student.
But another would rather walk to school.
The first yellow buses are due to be road tested in England later this year, and - given the approval of local education authorities - could be carrying their first schoolchildren soon after that.
As a result the sentences of the 1,200 inmates on death row will be now be commuted to life imprisonment.
Mrs Arroyo said she welcomed the change but insists she is not softening her stance on fighting crime or terrorism.
Mrs Arroyo has been under pressure from the influential Roman Catholic church to scrap capital punishment.
The signing comes as she prepares to head to Rome for an audience with Pope Benedict XVI.
In a speech Mrs Arroyo said "we yield to the high moral imperative dictated by God to walk away from capital punishment".
Earlier she had assured the public that the end of the death penalty did not mean there would be a soft stance against criminals.
The repeal comes just days before Mrs Arroyo visits the Vatican for an audience with Pope Benedict XVI.
Some analysts see the repeal of the death penalty as an attempt to win support from bishops for the president's plan to move to a parliamentary system of government.
Others say Mrs Arroyo is trying to diffuse opposition from the church to the government's efforts to revive mining.
The death penalty was abolished once before in 1987 but was re-imposed seven years later after a rise in crime.
Under that law seven executions were carried out by lethal injection, but in 2000, the then president, Joseph Estrada, ordered a moratorium after strong lobbying by the church, the European Union and human rights groups.
Legislation introduced in 1998 limited the number of tablets in packets of common painkillers such as paracetamol and salicylates such as aspirin.
Until the legislation was introduced the number of fatal overdoses involving painkillers had been rising steadily.
It is suspected that some people who have died did not realise how powerful painkillers can be, and had no intention to take their own lives.
A team from the Centre for Suicide Research at Warneford Hospital in Oxford studied the impact of the change in the law in the first year after its introduction.
They found that the number of deaths from paracetamol poisoning fell by 21%, and from salicylates by 48%.
The number of liver transplants performed as a result of paracetamol poisoning also fell by two thirds.
Rates of non-fatal self-poisoning involving paracetamol fell by 11% in the 12 months following the introduction of the new law.
The average number of paracetamol tablets taken in an overdose fell by 7% and there was a 17% drop in incidents involving 32 or more pills.
The researchers, writing in the British Medical Journal, suggest that even more deaths may be avoided if the maximum pack size was decreased still further - possibly to 24 tablets.
"Since the new legislation, pharmacies and other retail outlets have usually allowed only one pack to be bought per transaction," they say.
"Although this does not prevent a customer visiting several outlets to amass a large supply of the drugs, the general effect of the legislation is to reduce the maximum number of analgesic tablets available for impulsive self poisoning.
Paracetamol is the most common way of self-poisoning in the UK.
Overdoses of drug are also responsible for half of all cases of liver failure in this country.
Before the new laws, overdoses of paracetamol accounted for 40,000 hospital referrals a year and between 100 and 150 deaths.
Aspirin overdoses accounted for about 5,000 hospital admissions annually and about 60 deaths.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence estimates the move would cut the number of unplanned pregnancies by 70,000 each year.
In 2003-4, only 8% of women aged 16-49 used long-acting contraceptives, which also include implants and the coil.
That compared with 25% who took the Pill and 23% who relied on condoms.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that the advantage of the long-lasting birth controls is that women do not have to remember to use contraceptives every day or each time they have sex.
It has now issued guidance for England and Wales saying that long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods should be offered to all women seeking advice on contraception.
But campaigners have warned that encouraging increased use of these methods could help fuel promiscuity and the rise of sexually transmitted infections.
About 30% of pregnancies in Britain are unplanned, it is estimated.
Some of these are down to failure to use contraceptive as directed, such as remembering to take the Pill.
By contrast, LARC methods such as implants, injectible contraceptives, and coils - namely intrauterine devices and the intrauterine system- are less susceptible to incorrect usage.
Its new guidelines aim to promote greater contraceptive choice for women, which, in turn, could help reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortion rates.
It would also be cheaper for the NHS if more women used LARC methods, NICE calculates.
"This will ensure that women can choose and manage, after consultation with their doctor, their own contraceptive needs.
"Overall, LARC methods are not only more cost-effective than the combined oral pill but are also more effective at reducing unintended pregnancy.
But campaigners Norman Wells, director of Family and Youth Concern, said NHS money would be best spent highlighting the benefits of faithful and long-term relationships rather than indiscriminately promoting contraception.
Toni Belfield of the Family Planning Association said women should be given every opportunity to make an informed choice about what contraceptive method best suits them.
Jan Barlow, chief executive of Brook, welcomed the guidelines but stressed that LARC methods did not protect against sexually transmitted infections, and young people must also be encouraged to use condoms.
Baroness Gould, chair of the Independent Advisory Group on Sexual Health and HIV called on the government to monitor PCTs' provision of contraception.

But as the country approaches a second election, teachers are frustrated with the lack of change, despite the ANC government's vision of a decent standard of education for all South Africans.
"Five years ago, many of us were starry-eyed at the new education system we were promised," said last month's editorial in the monthly journal TheTeacher.
Although all South African schools are officially non-racial, a recent report by the Human Rights Commission concluded that "racism in South African schools is flourishing".
Dr Trevor Coombe, a senior official in the Department of Education, maintains that the government never promised any quick fixes.
"There was a clear recognition that the transformation of the system was the work of decades," he says.
And there is no denying the size of the task faced by the new administration in trying to bridge the gulf between education standards in white and black schools.
Education in the old South Africa was governed by a complex ethnically-based bureaucracy, whose legacy remains in the form of corruption and inefficiency.
Racial discrimination is being replaced by social class discrimination, critics of the present system argue.
The education act passed by the new government gives a large degree of autonomy to state schools.
Autonomy may sound like a good thing, but critics argue that it helps to perpetuate inequalities.
A school committee made up of affluent professionals is much better able to raise funds and govern the school than a committee of poor parents who may themselves be inadequately educated.
While the law exempts the poorest parents from paying school fees, parents sending their children to middle-class schools are faced with extra costs, like expensive uniforms and school outings.
In short, the schools with the best facilities cost the most - and only those black pupils who come from relatively wealthy homes are likely to secure a place.
But black children who do make it to a formerly white school face a new set of problems.
Even where classes are racially mixed, black pupils may face racism - whether overt or subtle - from a school establishment which remains predominantly white.
And since the vast majority of South Africans are black, it is clear that even if all the formerly white schools could be purged of racism, this would still not meet everybody's educational needs.
South Africa needs more classrooms and better-trained teachers - and that costs money.
Global financial pressures have forced the government to shelve its Reconstruction and Development Programme - a grand plan for social spending - in favour of a more conservative approach.
"The education policy may be very progressive, but the redress is just not happening," says Salim Vally, a reseacher at the University of the Witwatersrand's Education Policy Unit.
"It's not just a question of throwing money around - but you can't deny that resources in schools are a problem," he adds.
Dr Coombe says that while the government has aimed to maintain its social spending levels, the amount of money spent on each pupil has declined, as the school system has grown.
He adds that the government may have to consider raising its per-pupil spending, "in order to avoid the suffocation of the system".
Much of the government's efforts of the past five years have been in shaping new policies and new structures - efforts which may not be immediately apparent to teachers and pupils in overcrowded, underfunded schools.
"It was imperative that we attack the inherited apartheid system root and branch," Dr Coombe argues.
Much of the criticism of the government's performance so far has been directed - rightly or wrongly - at Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu, who is due to step down after the elections.
Philippa Garson, editor of The Teacher, agrees that Dr Bengu's term of office was concerned primarily with creating new policy, but says his successor must be the one who oversees tangible improvements in education.
"There is no excuse now for not delivering," she says.
He was from 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards and died near Nad Ali District Centre in central Helmand on Monday.
Lt Col Nick Richardson, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, extended heartfelt sympathies to his family and friends.
The number of UK troops killed since the start of operations in Afghanistan in October 2001 has now reached 220.
Next of kin have been informed.
The latest fatality follows the death of 24-year-old senior Aircraftsman Marcin Wojtak, from 34 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment, on Thursday.
He was killed in a blast near Camp Bastion, also in Helmand province.
The University of Cambridge wants to attract the brightest young men and women into its membership, and social class, gender and ethnic background have no place in selection for admission.
Why is it then that some perceptions can be so different and why is it that 'access' to Cambridge (and Oxford) is so often a matter of debate and controversy among young people, their parents and their advisers at school, the media and the government?
A recent independent study by the National Foundation for Educational Research into the factors that influence young people in state schools in their decision whether or not to apply to Oxbridge has shown us the need to provide reassurance to would-be state school applicants, and particularly to women.
They mean this socially as well as academically and I have no doubt that if that message could be passed back to younger pupils in their schools (and their teachers), some of the fears associated with application to Cambridge would go away.
The crucial aspect of interviewing for us is that it engages college tutors directly in the selection of the students they will teach.
When some candidates consider Cambridge, there can be a perception that it will be more expensive than elsewhere, a view on occasion fuelled by high society images in soap operas depicting university life.
Access to Oxbridge can be more precisely defined in terms of the schools (state or independent) with a significant number of pupils who achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A or A*.
The study of access is also being attempted by the University Funding Councils by matching the applicants to individual universities with the affluence or otherwise of their homes as indicated by their postcodes.
However access is measured, the bottom line for Cambridge is that too few bright young people in state schools apply for admission.
To that end, the university and the colleges are redoubling their efforts to improve their literature, their admissions procedures and open days, and in many other ways including, above all, engaging the support of our present students - our best ambassadors.
This is our space for those involved in education to reflect on how it is going from their corner of the world.
The views expressed here are personal.
Officials are now working out the best way of telling patients operated on at Plymouth's Royal Eye Infirmary over a three-year period.
They estimate that about 200 of the patients out of some 5,000 given the lens may need further surgery.
It follows a recall by the manufacturers after reports that some lenses became cloudy.
It follows a recall by the manufacturers after reports that some became cloudy.
The problem developed because of the way the lens was packaged, affecting a small proportion.
The affected patients were all given the lens between December 1997 and May 2001.
Plymouth Hospitals Trust is trying to determine the best way to contact the patients with the affected lens.
It will then have to try and identify which of the estimated 4% of patients will develop cloudy vision.
The 17th Century Ashdown House, in Lambourn Downs, in Oxfordshire, has been owned by the National Trust but was sold on a 60-year lease in 1990.
The remainder of the lease is now for sale but potential occupants are warned the property needs work and is "not for the financially faint-hearted".
The house dates back to the mid-17th Century and was built by the Lord Craven for Charles I's sister, Elizabeth, the exiled Queen of Bohemia, so she might avoid the plague in London.
She died before she could see it and Lord Craven never married but the property remained with the Craven family until 1956 when it was given to the National Trust.
"The house has had as much love lavished upon it as it has money invested in its upkeep and taking on this property is not going to be for the financially faint-hearted.
He says he wants more freedoms for the flagship scheme, which sees private sponsors provide up to �2m, and being given a say in the way they are run.
The academies have attracted criticism and are viewed by some as a threat to the future of state education.
But the Conservative leader said being in opposition was not just about opposing the government.
He and shadow education secretary David Willetts toured new buildings at the London Academy, in Edgware, north London.
City academies, which replace schools in difficulty, typically cost about �25m.
The government wants 200 academies open or under construction by 2010, saying they want to raise standards in deprived areas.
The leader of the Scottish National Party said Henry McLeish's admission of error and willingness to pay back up to �36,000 had "fundamentally weakened" his position and he should consider standing down.
Mr McLeish had originally agreed to pay the House Of Commons fees office �9,000 in a row over sub-letting his constituency office in central Fife.
He stressed that while mistakes were made, he would not resign.
SNP leader John Swinney said he was "staggered" by the potential amount of money involved.
He accused Mr McLeish of breaking the bond of trust with the public and said his position was becoming untenable.
Mr Swinney accused the first minister of avoiding the issue.
"It has now come to a conclusion and the first minister has got to answer how he can remain in office when the bond of trust between him and the Scottish public is fundamentally weakened, and he now must resign," he said.
Mr McLeish must now face his political opponents face-to-face in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday.

Weir and Gordon will start - Burley
Number one choice goalkeeper Craig Gordon also returns from injury.
And manager George Burley has already said Weir and Gordon will start against Macedonia on 5 September.
Stephen McManus is included but is yet to play a game for Celtic this season, while Steven Caldwell and Christophe Berra make it despite fitness worries.
Ross McCormack, Barry Robson and Chris Iwelumo are ruled out with injuries, while Kevin Thomson and Garry O'Connor have been overlooked.
With Gary Caldwell suspended for the clash with Macedonia and the injury concerns surrounding his brother Steven, McManus and Berra, Burley has called upon the experience of 39-year-old Weir.
The Rangers defender won the last of his 63 caps in the 0-0 draw with Norway at Hampden last October, his only appearance in this World Cup qualifying campaign.
Weir will become the oldest outfield player to represent his country since Jimmy McMenemy in 1920.
"I've been in touch with Davie since I've been the manager, he has played in some of the games and played against Norway at Hampden last year," said Burley.
"But David is turning 40 and it is a big ask for a player of his age to play international football, it is a big jump up from the SPL.
"Davie is a model professional but you are trying to introduce other players.
The absence of forwards Iwelumo and McCormack has paved the way for Kilmarnock's Kyle to add his considerable height to Burley's attacking options.
The 28-year-old has not featured for his country since 2004 but has discovered a new lease of life at Rugby Park.
The former Sunderland and Coventry striker has scored 10 goals in 14 appearances for the Ayrshire side.
"It's something that I didn't think would happen," Kyle told BBC Scotland.
"Five years ago, my career ended abruptly because i was injured and I never quite forced my way back into the team once I got fit.
"But if you play week in, week out and score goals, it can give you a chance.
"Obviously George has picked me on my form and I've been scoring goals most weeks, so I think it's good that he's willing to pick other people than the ones being picked recently.
Gordon made his comeback from a four-month spell on the sidelines as Sunderland swept Norwich aside on Monday night, meaning Aberdeen keeper Jamie Langfield drops out of the 25-man squad.
A crushing 4-0 defeat in Norway earlier this month has left Scotland's hopes of qualifying through the play-offs hanging in the balance.
Anything less than three points against Macedonia would extinguish them altogether.
Burley has won just two of his 10 games in charge of Scotland but shrugged off suggestions he had these two games left to remain at the helm.
"Every game, I will try my best for my country and do whatever I can to get the right results.
"I got all the criticism after the Norway game but I will take it on the chin.
"I've been knocked since I took the job.
Lorenzo and former team-mate Valentino Rossi were fierce rivals but the mood is now much better the Spaniard said.
"Ben's serious on the track like me but we have no problems and I don't think we will in the future either," he said.
Lorenzo also revealed that he thought the American, who earned his factory-team chance after impressing for the satellite Tech3 Yamaha team last season - when he was named rookie of the year - could be a serious contender this year.
Lorenzo, 23, romped to his first elite-class world title last season as rivals such as Rossi and Casey Stoner were plagued by injury and technical problems but said he was full of confidence ahead of the new campaign which starts in Qatar on 20 March.
"I'm more relaxed than last year, not because I am the world champion but because I am older so I have more experience," he added.
Spies said he felt under less pressure this season than last, but knew what he had to do this year to maintain the progress of his career.
"Now I need to keep giving 100%, I've got a great crew behind me and am riding for a great manufacturer.
"We should have a great bike this year and I've got a world champion team-mate so I've got the best of the best.
State police commander Guillermo Aranda said residents in the village of Guatape were taken one by one from their homes by men in combat uniforms and shot in the head.
Coronel Aranda said it was not yet known if the killings had been committed by rebels or paramilitaries.
The authorities say they do not know who committed this latest killing.
The authorities have blamed paramilitaries for Wednesday's attack in which 11 suspected guerrilla sympathisers were rounded up in the town of Yolombo and killed.
Rebels and paramilitaries have been involved in intense combat for control of the area.
Police say they recorded 205 massacres in 2000, in which 1,226 were killed.
Most of the killings were attributed to paramilitaries.
According to the US-based group Human Rights Watch, paramilitary groups are responisble for 70% of the human rights abuses in Colombia, most of them massacres of unarmed civilians.
Correspondents say the conflict - which in the last decade has claimed some 35,000 civilian lives - has intensified in recent months.
Peace talks began two years ago between Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces (Farc), and the government, but were broken off two months ago by the guerrillas.
Labour has won the Glasgow North East by-election, sparked by Michael Martin's resignation as Commons Speaker in the wake of the MP expenses scandal.
Willie Bain polled 12,231 votes and said he was ''honoured'' to be the constituency's new MP.
He added it was ''a resounding victory for Gordon Brown and for Labour''.
Sir Bernard Ashley set up Laura Ashley with his late wife.
Sir Bernard, who died on Saturday after suffering from cancer, moved from Kent to Powys with his wife in 1961.
From humble beginnings at the Old Railway House in the little known village of Carno, the company grew to have 5,000 retail outlets worldwide.
Sir Bernard's death comes 24 years after Laura Ashley died at 60 following an accident at her daughter's home.
In 1984, a year before Laura Ashley died, the firm had opened its new company headquarters in Newtown, Powys, creating 500 jobs.
But in the 1990s its fortunes faded, and in 2004 its former headquarters in Carno closed.
In a statement, his family said he was "a larger than life character, very outgoing and social".
Derrick Pugh, a former manager at Laura Ashley in Carno, described Sir Bernard, known to his staff as BA, as a "one-off".
"Sir Bernard, in my view, never got over the death of Laura," he said.
"He was a very shrewd businessman and would not easily accept defeat.
"I spoke to his personal assistant in France this morning, and I was pleased to have learned that he had returned to his grass roots here in mid Wales and he will be buried in Carno close to Laura.
Laura Ashley Plc said its thoughts and sympathies were with Sir Bernard's family at this difficult time.
In later life Sir Bernard opened Llangoed Hall, a country house hotel near Brecon, and in 2000 he created Elanbach, a fabrics business.
He was knighted in 1987.

The military emblem of a shield, spear and knobkerrie is replaced by a traditional cone-shaped hat on the blue, white and green flag.
The hat worn by indigenous Basotho people was on the first independence flag but was replaced after a coup.
Lesotho says its new flag shows it "at peace with itself and its neighbours".
As part of the anniversary celebrations, King Letsie III planted trees at the foot of the statue of the founder of the Basotho nation, King Moshoeshoe I.
And a huge diamond found in a Lesotho mine is going on sale in Antwerp.
The world's largest diamond reported to have been found this century is a 603 carat white diamond named "Lesotho's promise".
The nation, devastated by Aids and saddled with big debts, has also published a major long-term development plan.
Lesotho's next elections are due in 2007.
The series, featuring George the hippo, loudmouth Zippy, human pal Geoffrey and Bungle the bear, beat The Magic Roundabout to first place in the poll.
Animated time traveller Mr Benn was joint third with Play School in the list, followed by Bagpuss.
The poll, conducted for new magazine CBeebies Weekly, saw 1,000 people aged 25-45 pick their favourites.
The rest of the top 10 consisted of The Wombles, The Clangers, Trumpton, Button Moon and Camberwick Green.
Rainbow mixed comic storylines, featuring the four main characters, with quirky animations and musical interludes by Rod, Jane and Freddy.
It was created to help fill daytime schedules when broadcasting hours were liberated in the early 1970s, but was cancelled when production company Thames lost its ITV franchise.
Short-lived attempts were made to revive the Rainbow characters in the 1990s, but in different formats.
Digital channel Nick Jr started repeating a Rainbow series from 1982 earlier this month as part of its evening nostalgia programming.
The Magic Roundabout, which was created in 1965, was revived as a film in 2005.
Pop star Robbie Williams and actors Sir Ian McKellen and Bill Nighy were among those adding their voices.
Other shows to make it into the top 20 included Jackanory, Rhubarb and Custard, Paddington Bear and Captain Pugwash.
It was known that ulcerative colitis, which affects around 100,000 people in the UK, runs in families.
Now researchers have linked the condition with the gene that encodes for interleukin 10 (IL10) - a compound which regulates inflammation.
IL10 therapy has been tested in early studies, Nature Genetics reported.
Ulcerative colitis normally appears in people aged 15-30 and symptoms include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, a frequent need to go to the toilet and weight loss.
Although symptoms can be mild, it can kill in severe cases if surgery is not performed in time.
Individuals with first-degree relatives who are affected are known to be at higher risk, but the individual genes involved had not been determined.
In the latest study, scientists scanned the whole genome in more than 1,000 people with the condition and 800 healthy controls.
Among a few gene differences, they found key variations in genetic regions directly alongside the IL10 gene.
Some early studies, mainly in mice, have already looked at IL10 for colitis therapy but negative findings had prompted researchers to look elsewhere.
"In light of these results, systemic or topical delivery of IL10 should be worthy of consideration for clinical trials," said study leader Professor Stefan Schreiber.
He added that further research on this area of the genome in colitis patients may point to as yet unknown drug targets.
The administration of interleukin 10 to individuals with colitis has been reported to have a positive effect in initial studies, although this potential therapy has not been assessed more thoroughly.
Professor Jack Satsangi a gastroenterology expert at the University of Edinburgh said previous research on IL10 as a treatment had focused on another inflammatory bowel condition, Crohn's disease.
"It may be that it didn't work in Crohn's disease but it's worth pursuing in ulcerative colitis," he said.
"There are also issues about whether it should be delivered systemically - orally, intravenously - or directly into the gut.
Professor Jonathan Rhodes, an expert in colitis based at the University of Liverpool, added that the study would help to unpick what was causing the condition - at least in some patients.
Security officials in Algeria have claimed a military success against an Islamist militant group that has been waging a war of insurgency for the past nine years.
They said the army had killed at least 28 rebels belonging to the second biggest Islamist faction, the Salafist Group or GSPC, to the south of the capital, Algiers.
The victory claim follows growing criticism of the authorities over their failure to put an end to endemic terrorism in Algeria in which an estimate 150,000 people have been killed.
Reports are rare in Algeria of military successes against Islamist rebels and this claim of victory is fortuitous for the government which is facing a wave of criticism.
The contrast is being made between, on the hand, the Algerian authorities inability to have any impact on the country's endemic terrorism, and, on the other hand, the forceful approach being taken by President Bush following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
The rebels were located 300km south of Algiers in mountains between the desert towns of Laghouat and Djelfa.
The group is said to have been active for some time and were responsible for transporting weapons from African countries to the south to their GSPC allies in the north of Algeria where many attacks have taken place in the last few weeks.
Earlier on Monday, news came through from Mascara in northwestern Algeria of the latest attack by the main Islamist group, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in which eight civilians were killed, six of them from the same family.
The cyclone that swept through coastal Orissa two weeks ago looks set to be the century's worst in terms of the number of casualties, and the immense damage to property and people's livelihoods.
Any food at all meant that the death was not a matter of official record, even if it was caused by malnutrition.
That verbal sleight of hand enabled government officials to say there had been no starvation deaths in west Orissa.
But the government and a powerful, venal business class in the affected areas knew they could avoid accusations of deliberate neglect by playing games with words until media attention moved on to another political crisis or natural disaster.
No one is starving to death in eastern Orissa - not yet - but grinding poverty and pronounced under-development have made its people immeasurably more vulnerable to the cyclone and its aftermath.
The state's finances are among the worst in India with just a tiny percentage of national business investment over the past 10 years.
Journalists in the state capital, Bhubaneswar, say governments in Orissa have been of very poor quality for many years.
There are also accusations of neglect by central governments, in part because Orissa has for years been governed by parties in opposition to those in power in Delhi.
Others say this is not a factor and that other Indian states have managed to overcome such neglect, if it exists at all.
Sociologists also say that the state's unique culture and language fall between the north Indian Hindi belt that tends to dominate national politics, and an almost as powerful Bengali presence in the east - another source of marginalisation in India's ethnically-sensitive political system.
The state is also without the large and active diaspora or migrant population that helps fuel development in south India or the western region of Gujrat
While probably no part of India could have been well prepared for such a ferocious cyclone, it's being said that Orissa had taken few if any steps to minimise the impact of storms which, after all, are an annual event.
The few dozen functioning cyclone shelters there were mostly built by the Indian Red Cross, and had no space for livestock - often the only assets of a poor family.
Many deaths probably occurred because poor farmers didn't want to leave behind a cow or a goat to go to the nearest shelter.
Food, medicine and emergency shelter materials were not stockpiled in vulnerable areas, and much of the early relief effort involved large awkward convoys of relief vehicles moving at a snails pace along blocked and damaged roads.
Finally, everything is being exacerbated by political tensions between Bhubaneswar and Delhi that seem frivolous and deeply cynical in the face of such widespread human suffering.
India is preparing to observe the new millennium and has begun another bout of introspection about itself, just as it did in 1997 for the 50th anniversary of independence.
Perhaps one question to be pondered is whether the indisputable achievements in agriculture, commerce, science, education and other fields are not in someway eclipsed by countless lives at the margins of society that can be so easily and routinely ruined by the wrath of nature.

The residents of East Coker, made famous by the poet TS Eliot, held a parish referendum under a little-used piece of historic legislation.
The motion said there should be no change of use for the next 15 years.
Developers see the land as an ideal place for a new housing development, but planners will now have to take the villagers' views into account when considering proposals.
Residents of East Coker want to stop the nearby town of Yeovil spreading into the open fields around their homes.
East Coker was much loved by the poet TS Eliot, whose ashes are buried in the local churchyard.
The village is featured in his work The Four Quartets.
The campaign to halt development is supported by its most well-known current resident, Trevor Peacock, who starred as bumbling church councillor Jim in the Vicar of Dibley.
The four must leave Russia within 10 days, and Moscow is to review visa applications for UK officials.
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was "disappointed" by what he called a "completely unjustified" move.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin said he thought both countries would overcome the "mini crisis".
On Monday four Russian embassy staff were expelled from the UK and the visa facilitation process for Russian officials was suspended.
The move was a response to Moscow's refusal to extradite the man suspected of murdering former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in November 2006.
Announcing the tit-for-tat response, foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said Moscow would not apply for any UK visas for Russian officials.
The prime minister's official spokesman told reporters that Downing Street was examining the implications of non co-operation on terrorism.
Earlier Tony Brenton, Britain's ambassador in Moscow, was summoned to Russia's foreign ministry and given "certain messages" to pass on to the Foreign Office in London.
He added that the decision to expel four British embassy staff was "completely unjustified" and help would be given to them and their families.
But he said he had been heartened by support from the "international community" and "positive statements about the need to defend the integrity of the British judicial system".
Mr Litvinenko, an ex-KGB agent who had taken UK citizenship, died of exposure to radioactive polonium-210 in London in November 2006.
Traces of the radioactive isotope was found in several places visited by another former agent, Andrei Lugovoi.
Mr Lugovoi denies involvement and says he is a witness, not a suspect in the case and has told Russian television that the outcome of the inquiry had been predetermined.
Under the European Convention on Extradition 1957, Russia has the right to refuse the extradition of a citizen and its constitution expressly forbids it from doing so.
The UK has the right to request Mr Lugovoi be tried in Russia, but the UK's director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, has already turned down the offer.
The UK's director of public prosecutions has recommended Mr Lugovoi be tried for murder by "deliberate poisoning".

He is the second Premier League managerial casualty of a new season that is just three games old.
And as with the departure of West Ham boss Alan Curbishley, Keegan has decided to step down over a lack of control over transfers.
BBC Sport details the reaction to Keegan's departure and provides a chronology to the last eight months of his managerial reign.
"The LMA has been supporting Kevin during a very difficult period.
"Whoever takes over, if he starts performing, if he wins games and gets them up there, they'll change their mind.
"But if they go on a bad run and lose game after game after game, I don't know what will happen, it'll be frightening.
"The whole emphasis of being a chairman and the whole thing of looking after football clubs has turned radically because of the wealth of the owners.
"Over the last few days the club has devoted itself to the discussions it has held with Kevin and as a result of those discussions had put together a set of practical suggestions for how to move forward.
"The club made it clear to Kevin that if he had any outstanding concerns on its proposals he should raise them with the club.
The Australian, who switches teams after this season, came sixth in the German GP - his best drive of the year.
The former Minardi driver, who has been in F1 for three seasons, also admitted that it would be difficult to leave the Milton Keynes-based team.

O'Sullivan crashes out against Bingham
Three-time world champion O'Sullivan struggled throughout and was lucky to be level at 4-4 after a scrappy opening session before resuming on Monday.
He was cruising at 6-4 after a fourth successive frame but a number of erratic shots let former practice partner Bingham back at the table.
World number 23 Bingham secured five frames in a row to claim a famous win.
It was a curious performance from O'Sullivan, currently ranked eighth in the new rolling system, with a number of loose shots at key times in this opening-round clash at Telford.
The fact that the former number one's father had been watching following his recent release from prison may have been a contributory factor but Bingham should be given huge credit for staying calm as the match concluded in increasingly bizarre and unpredictable fashion.
Despite both players sharing eight frames during Sunday's first session, Bingham may have been slightly disappointed having dominated for long periods at the start of this match.
O'Sullivan gracious after defeat by Bingham
The Basildon cueman knocked in a 90 and then a 72 and 73 to open up a lead of 4-2 before allowing 'the Rocket' to end the night on a high note.
Watching O'Sullivan take the first two frames on Monday afternoon, his fans would have felt confident their man had finally turned the corner - the opening frame gave him a 5-4 advantage and it was the first time he had led in the whole match.
However, the form of the player with four UK crowns to his name took a peculiar nosedive as he once again struggled to produce any consistency, not helped by a number of strange shot choices.
Bingham scrapped his way to level at 6-6 and soon made it three in a row with a steady break of 44.
O'Sullivan was looking increasingly distracted and disinterested and was struggling in the 14th frame, but he at least had an opportunity to take it to a re-spotted black if he could pot from brown to black.
Bingham will next play Marco Fu in the second round after Hong Kong's finest knocked in a 138 in the 14th frame to come from 7-6 down to beat Englishman Barry Hawkins 9-7.
The second biggest shock of the day resulted in world number three Ali Carter suffering a surprise 9-6 defeat against former English Amateur champion Mark Joyce.
Joyce beat Steve Davis in the final round of qualifying and continued his fine form to beat Carter, helped with a 103 in the afternoon and will next face Bristolian Judd Trump, 21, who defeated Jamie Cope 9-6.
Renowned for closing out opposition attackers with military precision, the 23-year-old has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Croatian national side.

The currency was still reeling from a clutch of data on Tuesday, which reinforced investors' belief that US markets are a better place to put their cash.
In Japan, expectations are growing that the central bank may raise interest rates at a meeting on Friday.
This has encouraged investors to switch their money into the yen, dealing a further blow to the euro.
"There's just no reason to buy the euro here," said one Japanese dealer.
Japan's interest rates have been at zero for several months and Bank of Japan governor Masaru Hayami now thinks the time is right to raise them again.
But he faces political pressure to keep rates unchanged.
Prime Minister Mori fears a rate rise could cripple the fragile recovery.

A huge crab brought to Europe nearly 40 years ago is suddenly finding favour in Western markets.
The king crab, an edible species said to taste like a mixture of lobster and prawn, has successfully colonised Europe's coldest waters.
A native of the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East, it was introduced in the 1960s to a fjord on what was then the Soviet Union's north-west coast.
Now it has migrated westwards to Norwegian waters in the Barents Sea, and is heading south.
The Norwegians found the invader in their nets by chance in the 1980s, but are only now realising its lucrative potential.
The crabs are too young to sell, and the trawler crews are left with damaged nets.
Japanese emissaries are arriving in the Norwegian capital to buy as many as they can, and plan to fly the best crabs home live.
And an experiment has already begun to farm them, in the hope of finding markets in Europe closer to home.
Juvenile crabs caught by the trawlers are being kept in seabed pens and fed for six months through the summer, when they discard their shells.
Before their new shells grow they put on 25% of their body weight, and grow correspondingly in value.
In a striking example of an alien species that appears to be causing little disruption in its new habitat, the king crab seems not to be harming other species.
The regional director of fisheries and aquaculture for Finnmark, Norway's most northerly county, is Runar Hartvigsen.
Now the crabs have firmly established themselves in the Barents Sea, Norway and Russia are sharing the stocks, as they share most other species.
The 72-year-old judge is being replaced by current Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, on Monday.
Lord Woolf was due to retire in 2003 but said he stayed on to see through the government's constitutional reform.
He also presides over the Queen's Bench Division but Lord Justice Judge will fill the new role of President of the Queen's Bench Division from Monday.
In recent years, the Lord Chief Justice has concentrated on hearing criminal appeals and setting sentencing guidelines.
Lord Phillips will take a wider role, hearing the most important civil and family appeals and presiding over the criminal division of the Court of Appeal.
Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which comes into force next year, the Lord Chief Justice, as president of the courts, becomes responsible for "representing the views of the judiciary of England and Wales to Parliament, to the Lord Chancellor and to ministers''.
Lord Phillips is expected to have a staff of about 60.
That compares with the 12 people Lord Woolf has working for him.
Apart from sitting as a Law Lord, as an appeal judge for a month next year in Hong Kong and continuing to speak in House of Lords debates, Lord Woolf is going to work at his alma mater, University College London.
He will also become special adviser to and the first chairman of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution's new international arm, the International Conflict Management Advisory Group.
Lord Woolf will also join the independent not-for-profit commercial dispute resolution organisation's senior mediation panel.
Lord Phillips was called to the bar in 1962, took silk in 1978 and became a Recorder in 1982.
He became a High Court judge in 1987 and an appeal court judge in 1995, later becoming a Lord of Appeal in 1999 and Master of the Rolls - in charge of the civil division of the court of appeal - in 2000.
As an appeal court judge, he presided over long and complex trials including that of the Maxwell brothers and the case of investment company Barlow Clowes.
He was made a Law Lord in January 1999 and is also well-known for cycling to and from court.
He is being replaced as Master of the Rolls by Lord Justice Clarke.
The Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) test aims to encourage the take-up of hearing aids.
The TUC said that as people were working longer, and with more than 40% of people over 50 suffering hearing loss, employees could struggle at work.
It said workers' communication should not be affected by deafness and urged them to take the test on 0845 600 5555.
The RNID estimates four million people are losing their hearing but doing nothing about it.
The charity launched the hearing test in December as part of its Breaking the Sound Barrier campaign.
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said employers should encourage their staff to take the test, in the interests of productivity.
"Many older workers are struggling to get by at work either because they are too ashamed to admit to their hearing loss or because they have no idea what to do about it," he said.
"Many may also be reluctant to advertise it for fear that their employers may treat them less favourably as a result.
RNID chief executive John Low said the phone test was "simple and non-intrusive".
"Both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss can take a real toll on people's confidence in the workplace," he said.
A survey for RNID by pollsters Mori suggested embarrassment was the main reason people did not discuss hearing loss.
The Mori survey - commissioned by the RNID - also indicated that nearly three-quarters of people with impaired hearing who had not consulted a GP or a hearing specialist said they did not think their hearing was "bad enough" to seek help.
Texas, as everybody knows, is the home of big hats, big hair and dirt-kickin' cowboy boots.
So there was more than a little nervous anticipation amongst many of those travelling with Tony Blair about what he would wear when he joined President George Bush at his Crawford ranch, just outside Waco in McClennan county.
While, in Australia, he revelled in his Paul Smith suits and THAT naked lady shirt.
So, understandably, the question on everybody's lips in Texas was how he would manage to top that while being driven around the Prairie Chapel Ranch by the president in his pickup truck.
Would he follow his host's lead and resort to blue jeans and cowboy boots, or maybe a bootlace tie and rhinestone belt?
Or would he go one better and attempt to out-cowboy the cowboys by spitting out chewing tobacco every few minutes?
As it turned out, there were no questionable fashion statements of that sort to frighten the livestock.
As somebody once said, a man always looks good in mourning.
In any case, thanks to some filthy weather - thunder, torrential rain and even tornado warnings - combined with the gravity of the talks, there was very little outdoor activity.
In fact, the two men spent a fair amount of time closeted together in face-to-face talks without even a note taker in attendance.
Probably the first chance for genuine R&R came at the end-of-summit dinner on Saturday night.
The president and the first lady were joined by their daughter Jenna and around 20 guests.
And Mr Blair was joined by Cherie and their daughter Kathryn and Mrs Blair's mother Gale, who had been holidaying in Florida.
The menu included pecan-smoked beef tenderloin, potatoes Anna, roasted tricolour peppers and asparagus, tomatoes and handmade mozzarella and a pudding of pineapple upside-down cake.
The wine list included a 1999 Gary Farrell Westside Chardonnay and a 1997 Duckhorn Merlot.
Like virtually every president before him, George Bush likes to entertain visiting leaders at his "real" home.
The downhome feel is good for the public image and acts as a reminder of how the man in the White House has not lost touch with his roots.
And Crawford, population 705, is about as downhome as you can get.
It is all wide, empty, country roads, baseball caps, big trucks and farmers.
And you just know you are going to hear the clang, clang of railroad crossings as you lie in your motel room in the small hours.
But, thanks to the president, there is the Red Bull gift shop which does a roaring trade out of visiting press packs from around the world.
This weekend they had special, "The British are coming" T-shirts prepared for the occasion - although the shopkeeper could not say whether the slogan was a threat or a promise.
Still it makes a refreshing change from the White House.

The campaign, launched about two weeks ago, requires internet providers to register users under their real names.
New technology has also been introduced to block porn websites based overseas.
The state-run Xinhua news agency says the growth of such sites may result in a decline in ethical standards among young people.
"Existing and developing technology should be sufficient to ensure the Chinese government's triumph in its campaign," the agency quoted an unnamed official as saying.
It is estimated that 87 million people in China use the internet, half of them under the age of 24.
Many visit porn sites to learn about sex as the subject is seldom discussed with parents, Shanghai student He Tao told AFP news agency.
"Porn websites are rooted in young people who are thirsty for the facts of life, on which education is so deficient," he said.
China's authorities have shown an ambiguous attitude to the rise of internet use.
On the one hand they see it as essential for the economy to have a computer literate population.
But on the other hand they have sought to restrict use of the internet for political purposes.
Beijing has blocked access to dissident websites and most foreign news organisations.
But the authorities say suspicions that he was planning a hijack have weakened since then.
Despite his release, prosecutors say investigations into the incident will continue.
They have imposed a travel ban on Mr Chatty, and ordered him to report to police regularly.
Mr Chatty - a Swedish national of Tunisian origin - was trying to board a Ryanair flight to Stansted Airport, north of London.
His arrest raised fears of further suicide attacks, as it came almost two weeks before the first anniversary of 11 September attacks on the United States.
But Chief prosecutor Thomas Haeggstroem said in a statement on Monday that the hijacking case had weakened in recent days.
"Nothing inthe investigation indicates that Chatty would have intended tocrash the plane against any target in Sweden or in any othercountry," the statement added.
Mr Chatty has said he has no connection with Islamic militants.
Suspicions against him increased after it was revealed that in 1996 he had briefly received training at a flying school in the United States - like some of the 11 September hijackers.
Following his arrest a court twice ordered that Mr Chatty should be detained for periods of two weeks, pending further investigations.
The second detention period ended on Monday.
Mr Chatty has admitted to having the gun, but denies having planned a hijack.
They have found that the level of salt can be significantly reduced without sacrificing taste.
Consuming high levels of salt is known to cause high blood pressure, which in turn can cause heart disease.
The new research, published in The Lancet on Friday, suggests food manufacturers could cut the level of salt in their produce and consumers would not notice.
Dr Anthony Rodgers and Dr Bruce Neal, researchers at Auckland University in New Zealand, carried out the study.
They varied the salt levels in loaves of bread - the single largest source of dietary salt.
The participants were given one piece of each type of bread and asked to rate its taste and to guess whether the bread had the normal or reduced salt content.
They added that small reductions in the salt content of processed foods would lead to lowering of the blood pressure in the population at large, "with considerable health benefits".
Belinda Linden, a cardiac nurse adviser at the British Heart Foundation, said the research was good news.
"Although it's a small trial it does confirm that there are positive ways in which manufacturers could play a strong part in reducing salt without reducing the taste.
However, Professor Graham MacGregor, of St George's Hospital, London, said there were huge commercial reasons for keeping the salt content of processed food high.
"On the face of it," he continued, "we've got all the details coming through from all the protocols as well as the amending treaty itself what we set out to achieve which is protecting the British national interest in these four crucial areas.
"For example, the Charter of Rights, we should be protected in British law on that and all the other areas we seem to have been able thanks to the negotiation to have achieved that.
Mr Brown was asked about the idea of Tony Blair becoming a Middle East envoy for the major powers.
Jon Sopel put to Mr Brown that he appeared to have acted in an underhand way when he offered Lord Ashdown a job, after Ming Campbell had said "no" Lib Dem would serve.
Mr Brown angrily rejected this accusation saying "This is not a correct account of what happened - it is a total travesty of what happened.
Mr Brown was asked whether or not deputy leadership candidates had hinted at shifts to the left on issues like Trident, taxes and relations with the US.
Mr Brown suggested a new role for Citizens' Juries - akin to jury service in criminal trials, in which ordinary people would contribute to the policy-making process.
"If you take the example of business, you know I feel that we could do better in the way we engage the business community in the big decisions about the future of our country.
"And so I'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for Britain, and that business council will be able to look at, adjudicate upon, inquire into the policies that we are pursuing.
"It will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment, the industrial policy, technology policy, should be independent of the government, like the Bank of England is independent of government.
Gordon Brown also made it clear that there would be no more money to the Scottish Parliament from central government.
The second thing is that people are pleased often by the standard of surgical care in the hospital but worried about, in a way, higher aspirations, making them worried about personal care, and so we've got to deal with these issues of cleanliness in food and standards and aftercare and the time that a doctor and a nurse has to deal with the patient, and if I may just finish with the third thing, is we've got to lead the world in the new cures from breast cancer to diabetes, to dealing with some of the diseases that have yet to be conquered, Britain, with its National Health Service, can, I believe, lead the world.
And so I'm going to propose over the next few days that we have a business council for Britain and that business council will be able to look at, adjudicate to parliament and inquire into the policies that we are pursuing, and it will also be able to look at how some of the parts of business policy at the moment, industrial policy, technology, should be independent of government, like the Bank of England is independent is government in government, but I want to draw and have a better relationship with all the great business leaders of our country who should be playing a part in helping us build a stronger economy, and of course, a more prosperous society for the years to come.
But the principle is in my view right, we are talking about building a better Britain, a more successful economy, a stronger society, I want to draw on the talents of people who can contribute to that and I think most people watching this programme will say that old tribal divisive politics have got less to offer than an inclusive approach that I'm talking about.

Debbie Stoner's life was shattered when her seven-year-old daughter, Jade, died after a road accident just outside her home.

Police worker Caroline Abel is certain she would have died before her 21st birthday if she hadn't received a kidney and liver transplant.
"Although it was 11 years ago, that transplant transformed my life", she says.
"They gave me a pager so they could let me know as soon as I'd be able to have my operation but they ended up actually ringing me personally.
"I wrote an anonymous letter to his family because you are able to do that and thanked them for his gift to me.
Father-of-two Stewart Rankin says his long wait for a heart transplant has taken a terrible toll on his family.
The 57-year-old has a congenital heart condition which means his heart is the wrong way around and his arteries pump blood to the wrong places in his body.
To compensate for the defect his heart works harder than a normal heart would and consequently is larger and more muscular than it should be.
"I've been on the waiting list for 19 months now and my time is ticking," he says.
"I'm finding it harder to exercise and I now have breathing problems but there is no match.
"To be fair, a lot of younger people are registering to be donors but there is a shortage in the older age groups and even ethnic minorities.
"My children are studying for the GCSEs and A-levels and I'm sure this stress is affecting them.
Norwich Union has unveiled a digital flood map of the UK which can pinpoint areas most at risk of flooding.
The firm says up to 600,000 properties across the UK may now be able to get insurance for the first time.
In Kent, 46,000 homes by the River Medway have been flooded with more than 70,000 hit across Sussex.
Initially the map will show areas in Kent, Sussex, Norfolk, Shropshire and the Isle of Wight with the company hoping to extend it across the rest of the UK.
The map was created using specialist mapping company, Intermap, which used an airborne radar system to work out the height of the land above sea level.
This was then used to produce the final map which shows where floods are likely to occur and how far they will spread.
As well as showing whether a property is at risk, the map shows how often a flood is likely to occur and to what depth.
In East Sussex nearly 27,000 properties flooded near the River Adur, Ouse and Cuckmere.
Some 46,000 homes near the River Arun and Lavant in West Sussex have also been hit by floods.
Judges - including our very own Ore - selected the three from a list of 10 of the UK's brightest sporting stars.

Shrewsbury's home defeat saw the end of their five-game unbeaten run, which began with a 2-2 draw at home to Macclesfield on Boxing Day.
Now the League Two play-off hopefuls are hoping to embark on another run, starting with the return game at Macclesfield this Saturday (6 February, 1500 GMT).
"We started well by getting the ball up to our strikers and we had a great opportunity with Jake Robinson.
"After that, we stopped turning them, stopped putting them under pressure, and gave ourselves problems when we were a bit too tippy-tappy.
"We had a go at them second half, but it's a massive disappointment to have lost the way we did.

Defending US Open champion Marat Safin easily disposed of Argentine Mariano Zabaleta in a scrappy match to reach the semi-finals in just under two hours.
Safin, who is the first men's player to reach the semi-finals, will meet the winner of the eagerly awaited clash between Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.
"It's a big honour for me to play against (either of) them,"said Safin afterwards, who beat Sampras in three sets in last year's Open final.
Zabaleta had made a mockery of his ranking outside the world's top 100 at Flushing Meadows, but the quarter-final stage proved a round too far.
The Argentine had his chances - he broke Safin's serve in the second set and had a break point in the fourth game of the third set - but he was unable to take them.
The 21-year-old Russian, who is named after the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat, showed no such hesitation and triumphed in straight sets.
Zabaleta, who had been broken only three times in four US Open matches, was broken three times in the first set by Safin.
Zabaleta did manage to break Safin's serve in the second set's fourth game.
But the Russian, who had already broken the Argentine's serve in the third game of that set, immediately broke back.
Safin, in the third set, made the decisive breakthrough in the fifth game, when he recovered from 0-30 on Zabaleta's service game to break the Argentine's serve.
Then the Russian, who at times during the game was disturbed by the windy conditions, broke the Argentine's serve in the seventh game.
"It was very difficult conditions to play here as it waswindy," said Safin.
In an untidy match the defending champion made 33unforced errors, three less than Zabaleta.
"It was not a nice match, but we both tried hard," said Safin.
It is calling on the government to extend water fluoridation to reach the 25% of the population where tooth decay rates are unacceptably high.
And it says it is sure its plans are safe.
Previous research has suggested links between too much fluoride and conditions such as Alzheimer's and bone disease.
Current legislation means that more than 60 health authorities are being prevented from fluoridating water supplies as water companies have the power of veto over implementation.
In areas where there is water fluoridation, decay is generally halved, according to the alliance.
But in Britain's poorest non-fluoridated communities children as young as two are suffering from tooth decay.
The figures show that in non-fluoridated inner city areas such as Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff, Liverpool, Manchester and Inner London as many as 20% of five-year-olds has already had at least one baby tooth extracted because of decay.
By contrast, in areas that have had water fluoridation for 30 years or more, such as Newcastle and Birmingham, only five per cent of five-year-olds have had an extraction.
"Tooth extraction under general anaesthetic also carries the risk associated with any general anaesthetic.
In its Green Paper on Public Health, Our Healthier Nation, launched in February 1998, the government stated its intention to review the current impasse over water fluoridation, and said "fluoridation offers an important and effective method of protecting the population from tooth decay".
In most places, where the fluoride concentration is substantially below the optimum level, it can be artificially topped up.
However, only about 10% of the population drink fluoridated water, mainly in the West Midlands and the North East.
The National Alliance for Equity in Dental Health consists of 39 national medical, dental and voluntary organisations, including the British Medical Association, the British Dental Association and the Health Education Authority.
Tony Blair is using his Guildhall speech on foreign policy tonight to try to salvage the World Trade talks next month in Hong Kong.
He's throwing down a gauntlet to political leaders to deliver on the promises made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles to free up trade to help the world's developing countries.
So far, bitter talks aimed at reaching a deal, ahead of next month's WTO meeting, have failed - and in the complex world of trade negotiation, failure this close to the meeting could prove fatal.
Our Economics Editor, Stephanie Flanders, will be at the Guildhall for the Prime Minister's speech and joins us live.
Tim Franks has had exclusive access to the European Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, as he's been trying to persuade European, and other countries, to reduce farm subsidies to encourage more trade with developing countries.
On the domestic front, after last week's defeat over the terrorism bill, Mr Blair has said that he and his ministers will listen more to rebels, and expend more effort bringing them onside.
Martha Kearney will be here with the latest.
Medical scientists are still digesting the amazing news that Andrew Stimpson, having once been found HIV-positive, has now tested negative.
Could he hold the clue to a future cure for Aids?
The hospital that carried out those tests has told us they are trying to get Mr Stimpson back in for more investigations to try to understand what's happened.
Our Science Editor, Susan Watts, has been looking into the story to find out how significant it might be for the fight against Aids.
Do we trust Intelligence any more?
Consider some American diplomats who recently, with their colleagues from other countries and international agencies, claimed to have cast iron information on Iranian plans for a missile capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
So have governments cried wolf too many times, and is the old fairy tale a modern parable they should take to heart as they try to re-establish faith in their security services?

Twenty-four celebs were given mini blank books to write what they like in, which were then sold for charity.
Rowling's book, which included pictures of Harry's witch's hat, broomstick and his trademark wire-rimmed glasses, was the third most expensive lot.
Madonna's volume, containing lyrics to her song American Life and a picture of the US flag, sold for �8,000.
The auction was organised by the magazine Tatler and raised a total of �125,000 for the London based homeless charity the 999 Club.
She became the first individual British gold medallist at the Winter Olympics for 30 years when she won the skeleton event in Vancouver.
The bus took her from her old school in Bath to a special event where everybody congratulated her.
More than 1,000 pupils waved flags and cheered Amy on.
Amy had her mum and dad on the bus with her, and she described the welcome home parade as "crazy".
Katy Livingston, Mhairi Spence and Lindsey Weedon led going into the final discipline in Berlin - the 1500m relay.
They just held off a strong finish by the Polish team to win gold, with hosts Germany taking bronze.
"We've had some ups and downs here, but this shows that there's plenty of quality in the team," said GB performance director Jan Bartu.
The British trio were in third place after the first discipline, the shooting, and climbed to second behind Russia after the fencing.
They held onto second after the swimming, and grabbed a 42-point lead in the riding.
Violence in Nigeria, Algeria and Pakistan, the weak US dollar and the threat of cold weather have all raised prices after the new year break.
There are concerns that the high price of oil will stoke inflation at a time when many central banks are trying to cut interest rates to stimulate growth.
US shares had already been hit on Wednesday by figures showing that the manufacturing sector was contracting.
"All of the factors that pushed us above $80 are now moving us higher," said Peter Beutel at Cameron Hanover in Connecticut.
But some analysts played down the relevance of passing the $100 mark.
"The entire focus on $100 oil is frivolous," said Tim Evans at Citigroup Futures Research in New York.
Trading volumes were about half of their usual levels as traders returned from their new year breaks, which may have exaggerated the effect of speculative transactions, analysts said.
"I would imagine the speculators are the biggest drivers today," said Phil Flynn from Alaron Trading in Chicago.
The oil-producers' cartel Opec has also blamed speculators for the high price of crude and said that there is plenty of the fuel in the market to meet demand.
President Bush has said he would not be drawing on the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to try to bring down prices.
"This president will not use the SPR to manipulate (oil prices)," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.
There are those who believe that oil prices can rise significantly higher.
While daily price rises have been blamed on unrest in oil-supplying countries such as Nigeria, an underlying and significant factor has been an increase in demand from China and India.
"$100 is just the beginning," said Zachary Oxman, senior trader at Wisdom Financial in California.
Central banks such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve are worried that rising oil prices will prevent them cutting interest rates.
Expensive oil increases inflation, which makes it more difficult to make the rate cuts that the central banks may have to implement to boost growth.
Starting this week there will be a regular weekly meatless day, in which civil servants and elected councillors will opt for vegetarian meals.
Ghent means to recognise the impact of livestock on the environment.
The UN says livestock is responsible for nearly one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, hence Ghent's declaration of a weekly "veggie day".
Public officials and politicians will be the first to give up meat for a day.
It is hoped the move will cut Ghent's environmental footprint and help tackle obesity.
Around 90,000 so-called "veggie street maps" are now being printed to help people find the city's vegetarian eateries.
One of the men was Lance Corporal Ian Malone, 28, from Dublin.
A third soldier also died as UK forces consolidated their hold in the city overnight, after a major assault on Sunday.
Lance Corporal Malone's family said they were devastated by his death, but took some comfort fromknowing he died doing the job he loved.
Lance Corporal Malone joined the Irish Guards in 1997 and served in the United Kingdom, Poland, Oman, Canada, Kosovo and Germany.
He was also a member of the regimental pipe band.
British commanders in Basra said they made "big gains" in the assault and much of the city was now in their hands.
American tanks and armoured vehicles also launched a ferocious attack in the heart of Baghdad early on Monday morning.
Another of the British casualties to die in Basra was Fusilier Kelan John Turrington, 18, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.
The other two fatalities will not be named until their families are informed.
British troops, with 95 tanks and 80 Warrior armoured vehicles, are in the south, west and north of Basra, but not in the old city in the centre, which is bounded by a waterway in the east.
Meanwhile, a British Army spokesman in Basra has said that Ali Hassan al-Majid - who has been called 'Chemical Ali' by opponents of the Iraqi regime for ordering a poison gas attack that killed thousands of Kurds - has been found dead.
Major Andrew Jackson of the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment told the Associated Press that his superiors had confirmed the death during a briefing earlier in the day.
The army also confirmed that "scores" of vehicles carrying soldiers of 3 Para had begun to progress towards the old city.
Colonel Chris Vernon, said British forces have pushed to the Shatt-al-Arab - the city's main waterway - on two sides, and were also moving towards a presidential palace in the town.
Major General Peter Wall, Britain's deputy commander in the Gulf, said he was cautious about how much control they actually had in the city.
He said most of the regular army appeared to have left the city, but there were still some "small pockets" of paramilitary resistance which could well stage counter-attacks in coming days.
The old city, which is too narrow for tanks, would be entered by foot "soon", he said.
The BBC's Hilary Andersson, in southern Iraq, said there had been "sporadic resistance" overnight.
"Operations have been carried out by the British forces in a continued effort to try to clear specific buildings and specific areas where they suspect Iraqi military men and Fedayeen are hiding out," she said.
The BBC's Tim Franks, also in southern Iraq, said the troops had advanced with "surprising speed" on Sunday.
The massive raid on Basra, after a siege of about two weeks which saw many targeted attacks by UK troops, was staged when there were signs the regime was collapsing, officials said.
Reporters with the troops said their tanks entering Basra were greeted by cheering groups, and said people were honking their horns and giving thumbs-up signs.
Major targets included a naval base, the local Baath party headquarters and the city's College of Literature, which the troops now plan to use as a forward-operating base.
Tamil Tiger rebels says the bodies of hundreds of dead Sri Lankan army soldiers have been abandoned on the battlefield since fighting in May.
Relatives of Sri Lankan soldiers missing in action met Mr Thamilselvan to ask for help in tracing the disappeared men.
They travelled to rebel territory among a group of pilgrims attending an annual festival at an important Catholic shrine there.
Mr Thamilselvan told the 10 relatives of missing soldiers who met him that they had been lied to by the Sri Lankan army and it was wrong for mothers to think their sons might still be alive and in rebel custody.
Mr Thamilselvan said when the Tigers captured the north-eastern town of Mulaittivu five years ago, they had asked the Red Cross to hand over nearly 1,000 dead bodies to the Sri Lankan Government.
But he said the military had only accepted 55 to return to their families, and had buried the rest with full military honours on the spot.
Mr Thamilselvan also said that during the last military offensive in May soldiers had walked into a minefield near Elephant Pass.
He said there were still hundreds of decomposing bodies left there because neither side could safely retrieve them.
But the Sri Lankan military spokesman, Brigadier Sanath Karunaratne, denied the reports, saying they were merely aimed at demoralising the parents of missing soldiers.
He said even if the army can't retrieve a body because it might cost another life, it would never categorise that soldier as missing.
The group of relatives of missing servicemen say they represent 3,000 who have been left in limbo, not knowing whether their loved ones are alive or dead.
The law seeks to stop conversions by allurement, greed or pressure.
The opposition Congress party and religious minorities as well as human right groups have opposed the new law.
The law comes at a time when Hindu hardline groups have been accusing a Christian mission in Kota town of carrying out forced conversions.
The law provides for a maximum of five years in prison for those found guilty of carrying out forced conversions.
The Congress party has alleged that the legislation will target religious minorities.
They say the law has been brought about by the state's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the behest of the Rashtriya Sawyamsevak Sangh (RSS) - which provides much of the ideological inspiration to the BJP.
Hardline Hindu organisations such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have welcomed the move.
A copy of the bedroom where the young girl hid from the Nazis during World War II is the centrepiece of the Anne Frank Festival at Liverpool Cathedral.
The festival exhibition features pages from Miss Frank's diary and testimony from Holocaust survivors.
It is being staged in Liverpool as host city of the memorial day on 27 January.
The culmination of the Holocaust memorial day marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in 1945.
The Anne Frank + You festival explores the persecution of Jews under the regime of Adolf Hitler as well as looking at contemporary issues including bullying, racism and the identity in modern day Britain.
The Anglican Cathedral display charts the Jewish girl's move from Frankfurt in 1933 to the secret annexe in Amsterdam which was home to the family from 1942 to 1944.
They were then captured and taken to concentration camps where Anne died.
Her diary was discovered and published in 1947 by her father Otto who survived.
Liverpool's Lord mayor, Councillor Paul Clark, who recently visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with 200 pupils from the city has officially opened the festival.
"This is great opportunity for the people in Liverpool to experience, it should get a powerful and poignant reaction.
Admission to the festival is free and runs until 8 February.
The casket, containing bones from her thigh and foot, is on a nationwide tour and after Liverpool will be sent to Salford, Manchester and Lancaster.
She was described by Pope Pius X as "the greatest saint of modern times".
The Roman Catholic Church said the relics had been credited with promoting healing and reconciliation.
Auxiliary Bishop Tom Williams said everyone was "amazed" at the numbers of people who had come to view the nun's relics.
"It's been stunning, we had thousands and thousands of people visiting us on Thursday," he said.
St Therese, a French Carmelite nun who died of tuberculosis in 1897 aged 24, came to wider attention after her autobiography was published.
She had a particular fondness for nature, hence the name by which she is often known, "The Little Flower".
A relic is either part of the physical remains of a holy person after their death or an object which has been in contact with his or her body.
One of her relics was taken up in the Space Shuttle Discovery last year.
They arrived in England on 16 September and have so far been taken to Portsmouth, Plymouth, Taunton, Birmingham and Cardiff.
Before coming to Liverpool, the relics were at Clifton Cathedral in Bristol.
A Thursday morning service to Palma, Majorca marked the opening of Robin Hood Airport near Doncaster.
More than 600 people are already employed at the South Yorkshire site and the number is expected to rise to 7,000 within 10 years.
The new airport will offer flights to European destinations, plus from next year long-haul flights to Florida, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
RAF Finningley, which was used as a Bomber Command base during World War II and the Cold War, was closed in 1996 and bought by Peel in 1999.
The firm hopes the site, located seven miles from Doncaster, will also handle large quantities of freight.
He added that Robin Hood Airport was the most challenging project the group his company has undertaken and he said no expense had been spared on the terminal.
But concerns about the environmental impact of Robin Hood Airport have been expressed by Friends of the Earth (FoE).
"The true cost of cheap flights for local communities around Finningley will be blaring aircraft noise, disturbed nights and overcrowded roads, " said FoE's aviation campaigner, Richard Dyer.
Title-holders TP Mazembe of DR Congo twice meet Tunisia's Esperance in the African Champions League final over the next month to determine the victor.
Should the African champions beat Pahchuca, a semi-final date awaits with Internacional, the Brazilian side who won this year's Copa Libertadores.
The Club World Cup runs between 08-18 December in the United Arab Emirates.
Fifa conducted the draw in Zurich on Wednesday, with local Abu Dhabi side Al Wahda set to open the competition against Oceania champions Hekari United of Papua New Guinea.
European champions Inter Milan and next month's Asian champions make up the seven-team tournament, while Pachuca represent the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) region.
The first leg of the 2010 African Champions League final will take place on Sunday in Lubumbashi as three-time African champions Mazembe host Esperance.
The decisive second leg will be played in Tunisia on the weekend of 13-14 November.
Esperance, who were last crowned Africa's best in 2000, have never played at the Club World Cup.
You may never "ground your club" in a hazard.
This means you may not allow your clubhead to touch the ground before striking the ball.
If you do you will incur a two-stroke penalty.
Red stakes are used to mark a lateral water hazard.
This can be exactly the same as a normal water hazard - and in some cases may be a different stretch of the same stream.
But instead of running across a hole, a lateral water hazard runs towards it.
Because of this it is not possible to drop the ball behind the water in the same way for a normal water hazard.
The rules for playing and dropping the ball are the same as for the normal water hazard except in one regard.
A player can drop a ball within two clubs lengths of where the ball crossed the hazard on either side of the ditch as long as it is no nearer the hole.
A normal water hazard is marked by yellow stakes.
The stakes are movable obstructions so if they interfere with the ball or your stance you can usually move them without penalty.
The entire area of the ditch between the yellow stakes is deemed to be the hazard, not just the water.
So even if your ball lands on the bank, you may still not ground your club or remove twigs etc.
If the ball is lying in the water you may attempt to play it, but may not use any artificial aid to help your stance - although you can take off your shoes and socks!
Chrysler was worst hit, with sales plummeting 28%, while Ford reported a 10% drop.
The biggest car maker in the United States, General Motors, said its sales fell just 3%, describing it as a much better result than expected.
But all companies have been hit by higher marketing costs, as they try to lure customers into the showrooms by offering interest free credit and hefty discounts.
However, the figures are slightly distorted by the fact that September 2000 was a record month for Chrysler, so in the current economic climate the only way was down.
Chrysler said it would shut down a Canadian plant in Windsor, Ontario, for three weeks in October, and close four other plants for one week each.
Ford saw a 10% drop, but said its sales data were less gloomy when analysed day-by-day.
General Motors' performance stands in stark contrast to that of its rivals.
A drop of a mere 3% sets the company on track for its third-best year in history.
And once again a detailed analysis shows that the slump after 11 September may have been brief.
GM said sales were up 6% in the first 10 days of September versus last year, "then declined significantly following September 11th before increasing 22% in the last week of the month".
The incentive programme - dubbed "Keep America rolling" - taps into the patriotic mood sweeping the United States since the terrorist attacks.
Bill Lovejoy, in charge of sales in North America, said "consumers, by their actions, have provided a great deal of encouragement for our retail program".
But at the cheaper range of the market, the figures do not look that rosy.
Meletis Apostolides was one of thousands of Greek Cypriots who fled his home when Turkish forces invaded in 1974, following a Greek-inspired coup.
The land was later sold to Linda and David Orams, who built a villa on it.
The European Court of Justice says a ruling in a Cypriot court that the villa must be demolished is applicable.
Even if the ECJ ruling cannot be enacted because the land is under Turkish Cypriot control, it means Mr Apostolides will be able to pursue a claim for compensation in a UK court.
It could also open the way for hundreds more Greek Cypriots to demand restitution for properties they were forced to flee.
Many Britons and other foreigners have invested in property in northern Cyprus, despite the legal ownership still being in some doubt.
Mr Apostolides said he was "very much" pleased with the EU court's ruling, and that it was "what we expected".
The European Court of Justice ruling on Tuesday said that the decision of a Cypriot court in Nicosia was applicable in the north, even though Cyprus does not exercise control there.
It also said that one EU country - in this case the UK - must recognise judgments made in the courts of another.
The Republic of Cyprus joined the EU in 2004.
EU law was suspended in northern Cyprus for the purposes of Cyprus's accession, but lawyers argued successfully that the Orams' civil case still falls within the scope of the EU regulation.
Northern Cyprus is self-governing and still occupied by the Turkish army, but is not recognised internationally.
Nevertheless, it has become a thriving tourist destination in recent years, and house-building has boomed.
Some of those houses have been sold by Turkish Cypriots to foreigners, even though the land they were built on was once owned by Greek Cypriots and its legal status remained uncertain.
Property disputes dating back to 1974 have been one of the main obstacles to efforts to reunify Cyprus.
Correspondents say dispossessed Greek Cypriots are now likely to launch more legal battles, which in turn may harden opposition to reunification among Turkish Cypriots.

[VOX POPS ON THE STREET]
You see something happening in the street, do you step in?
Sometimes it's verbal abuse, sometimes it's worse, and even though the men filming used to be in special forces, they don't try to break anything up.
But on that night you took action.
The investigation looked at possible technical reasons for the loss of the probe and the lessons learnt which might benefit any future missions.
The team maintains its belief that a thinner than expected atmosphere may have thwarted a controlled landing.
The robotic laboratory was designed to search Mars for signs of life.
The last contact was an image of Beagle taken by its mothership, the Mars Express orbiter, on 19 December.
Despite many attempts to locate the probe - by overflying spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes - no sign of it, not even any wreckage, has been detected.
"The real reason for doing this [report] was to put the analysis down, to do a critique of what we did, to put those lessons learnt down for future possibilities," Dr Mark Sims, Beagle 2's mission manager, told the BBC.
The internal inquiry has led to a very technical 288-page document, which goes into every aspect of the mission's design and execution.
Unlike the successful US space agency rovers - the mobile "geologists" Spirit and Opportunity - Beagle had no means of contacting Earth from the moment it left its mothership, to the point it was supposed to open its antenna on the Martian surface.
Had it been able to feed back some information as it raced into the Martian atmosphere at 5km/s, the Beagle team might now have a better idea of which aspect of the entry/descent/landing sequence went wrong.
As it is, the scientists and engineers are left with the suspicion that their probe fell foul of a Martian atmosphere that was thinner than the one for which they had planned.
Subsequent analysis of data obtained by Mars Express and the rovers indicates the planetary scientists still have much to learn about the behaviour of the Red Planet's air.
A thinner atmosphere or even air pockets would have resulted in the spacecraft travelling too fast as it approached the surface; its parachute and air bags would have failed to open with sufficient time to allow for a soft landing.
But no photographic evidence for such a crater in the landing ellipse has yet been found and until it is, the team cannot really be sure what happened to their robot.
"My nightmare is that Beagle is sat there on the surface of Mars still trying to talk to us and, for the sake of a broken cable, it's not," said Dr Sims.
The team hopes that somehow Beagle's instrument package - universally agreed to be innovative - can be flown again.
Professor Pillinger has asked the US space agency if it would think about incorporating a Beagle payload into its 2009 Mars Science Laboratory - a large rover mission that would be dropped on to the surface by a "skycrane".
"[They could] take Beagle to Mars, leave it on the surface and drive away to carry on their own mission.
The House of Lords ruled Westminster City Council was owed the money after the "homes for votes" scandal of the late 1980s.
Dame Shirley was given a deadline of 1400 GMT on Thursday to make the payment.
She has asked for the deadline to be extended until January but the council has refused.
Dame Shirley and her former deputy David Weeks were branded corrupt by the House of Lords for selling council houses to possible Conservative voters in marginal wards to boost the party's election prospects.
They were both cleared in May 1999 by the Court of Appeal for willful misconduct and "improper gerrymandering" by selling off the council homes.
But an appeal by district auditor John Magill was allowed to go ahead and five Law Lords ordered the pair to repay the �27m losses claimed by the council.
"The 14-day period for recovery of the money has passed, and the surcharge is still outstanding.
"We will now take the appropriate legal steps to recoup the money.
"We have instructed a specialist firm of City solicitors, Stephenson Harwood, to assist in collecting the payment.
"We will be taking all practical steps to achieve this.
In 1999, Dame Shirley's solicitor Alan Langleben said she would fight the ruling in the European courts.
"Everyone agrees that I stole no money and I made no personal gain.
Dame Shirley now lives in Tel Aviv, Israel.
A spokesman for the Tesco heiress said she had won more time to settle the surcharge.
He claimed a High Court order was made on 21 December delaying any further discussion of the matter until 18 January.
However, Westminster City Council insists the deadline for payment has expired.
Dame Shirley's personal fortune is estimated at �70m.

Dean Moxey opened the scoring with a goal that should have been kept out by Preston goalkeeper Andy Lonergan.
A header from on-loan Spanish forward Alberto Bueno, following an assist from Shefki Kuqi, gave Derby a cushion.
And when Russell Anderson was brought down by Keith Treacy in the area, Robbie Savage slotted home the penalty on his 600th career appearance.
Savage, who turns 36 on Monday, was part of a Derby midfield who dominated their opponents throughout.
With some sharp passing and movement, they forced Preston onto the back foot straight from the outset and took 21 minutes to go in front.
Bueno picked out left-back Moxey and his left-footed cross-shot should have been dealt with by Lonergan, but the Lilywhites goalkeeper was beaten at his near post.
His opposite number Frank Fielding, making his debut after being signed on loan from Blackburn on Friday, was tested for the first time 26 minutes, easily coping with Jon Parkin's strike.
After Derby's well-worked second goal, Preston finally showed more ambition in the second half.
First Treacy drilled a shot from long range which Fielding palmed away and he then did well to keep out Sean St Ledger's header.
Derby had the final say as Savage converted his penalty after Treacy, who had already been booked, was sent off.

Ipswich remain rooted in the bottom three after being beaten 2-1 at home by Bolton.
George Burley's side never really recovered after falling behind to Gudni Bergsson's sixth-minute header from Per Frandsen's corner.
Midway through the opening half Michael Ricketts doubled Bolton's advantage with a superb individual goal.
The Bolton striker finished off an excellent passing move by flicking the ball over Matteo Sereni's head and then heading into the empty net.
Ipswich's seventh defeat of the season means they have now gone 11 games without a Premiership win.
Matt Holland's goal in first-half stoppage time had briefly revived Ipswich's hopes.
The Ipswich midfielder was given the opportunity to drill a low shot into the Bolton net thanks to Sixto Peralta's persistence on the edge of the penalty area.
Ipswich dominated possession in the second period as they sought to draw level, but they were unable to make that domination tell.
Ipswich's topsy-turvy season had suffered another downward turn on Saturday when striker Marcus broke his jaw after colliding with Spanish striker Pablo Counago in training.
Stewart's injury meant that the Ipswich attack was lead by Counago - starting a full game for the first time - and the 17-year-old Darren Bent, who was making his debut.
That inexperience told as Ipswich struggled to create sufficient clear-cut openings.
Bolton also made sure they got plenty of men behind the ball as Sam Allardyce's side soaked up Ipswich's patient passing movements.
The combination of an inexperienced attack and an often sluggish midfield meant that Ipswich were frequently restricted to long-distance efforts.
Counago did hit the post in the 12th minute after his low shot was pushed onto the woodwork by Bolton's Jussi Jaaskelainen.
Defender Mark Venus also tested Jaakelainen with a couple of long range shots.
On 68 minutes Martijn Reuser's powerful drive went agonisingly close and soon after Peralta hit the side-netting.
Ipswich's miserable day was complete when substitute and debutant Ulrich Le Pen was stretchered off the pitch late in the game.
The Frenchman was injured after he went in for a tackle with Ricketts.
Meredith Kercher was in a music video shortly before she moved to Italy - Video courtesy of Universal Records
The 21-year-old, from Coulsdon, Surrey, had just started a one-year course under the Erasmus programme of international exchanges to study modern history, political theories and the history of cinema.
Before leaving for Italy at the end of August 2007, she had been reading European studies at the University of Leeds.
Described as sociable and loving by friends and family, pictures show her smiling broadly.
But within three months she was dead in the flat she rented with Knox, in the Via Della Pergola in the central Italian city of Perugia.
Officers had entered the flat to return Miss Kercher's mobile phone, which had been found abandoned in a garden by a neighbour.
Miss Kercher's body showed signs of bruising, and tests revealed evidence of sexual activity shortly before her death - but a post-mortem examination could not confirm she had been raped.
Among the police's early theories was that Miss Kercher had been attacked by a heroin addict, because the flat was near a car park used by dealers - or that her death had been the result of a botched burglary.
But police soon arrested Knox, 22, and Sollecito, 25, and prosecutors accused them of killing Miss Kercher because she had refused to take part in an extreme sex session.
A pathologist's report said her death was slow and painful because despite the fact that her throat was cut, the blow did not sever her carotid artery.
Miss Kercher's family said she was a hard worker, but also enjoyed socialising with her friends and family.
Speaking of her trip to Italy, Miss Kercher's parents Arline and John said she was "excited at the prospect of spending the year studying there to improve her language skills, make new friends and immerse herself in the culture".
Her parents have three other children, Meredith's sister Stephanie and brothers John and Lyle.
Before going to university, Miss Kercher - known among friends and family as Mez - attended the £10,000-a-year private Old Palace School in Croydon, near London.
After her death, more than 100 students bowed their heads in silence at a vigil at Leeds University.
Miss Kercher's brutal and mysterious death has fed intense media speculation in both Europe and America.
The last mafia taboo has been broken.
The villages of Quindici and Lauro are about an hour's drive from Naples, and lie only a mile apart.
Two local families - the Cavas and the Grazianos - have been fighting a murderous campaign for control of the area for 30 years.
These villages have born the brunt of a brutal mafia war.
Juliet Dwek travels to Italy to reveal how the killing has shattered the mafia's unwritten laws.

And entertainment giant Disney is planning a mobile phone, targeted at up to 30 million children, which uses GPS to monitor where they are.
But Simon Davis, director of campaign group Privacy International, told BBC World Service's Culture Shock programme that he feared parents using GPS would find it both ineffective and dangerous.
"What this can result in - and we've seen this through visual surveillance technology and bugs that can be put into children's bedrooms - is parents becoming obsessed, to the point of having an unhealthy and destructive relationship with their children," he said.
"There is, particularly for young teenagers, a very important space that needs to be nurtured, for the development of the adolescent psyche.
There is a growing fear throughout the West about the safety of children, and parents are increasingly feeling they need to know where their children are and what they are doing.
But Mr Davis said that if parents can track their children, "people with sinister intent can do so too".
Mr Davis, who is also a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, said that one of his students had successfully proved how easy it was to hijack a GPS system, by putting Mr Davis' phone on a tracking project without his knowing.
"When we get to GPS tracking, that process goes beyond the cells we have at the moment, to tracking to within a few metres," he said.
"If students can do that to me, then somebody who wants to do harm to a child can do it very simply.
However, Michael Chong, a leading trend analysts in the US where this technology is being heavily promoted, said that he did not believe that the goal is to be tracking children.
Instead, he argued, it is giving people the "comfort" to parents of knowing that if something goes wrong, they have another method of being able to get hold of them.
He explained that similar technology had been put to highly effective and successful use by the US government, where it is designed to identify where a call to the 911 emergency system is located.
This, he said, means the emergency services can "instantly pinpoint" where someone is who needs help.
"I think that's a really great idea, because many, many times people can't even describe where they are," he added.
Karen Parlour was told by the Court of Appeal her award of �250,000 a year personal maintenance would go up to �406,500 and be reviewed in four years.
She said she was "very relieved at the outcome of the appeal".
The former optician's assistant, from Romford, Essex, had claimed the earning capacity Parlour had built up was a "matrimonial resource".
The judgement recognised the 31-year-old footballer's income would "plummet" in his mid-30s and his ex-wife would need to save an estimated �294,000 a year from her initial maintenance.
Christine Barker, head of the matrimonial department at law firm Laytons, told BBC News Online the judgement would be consigned to "a very limited number of cases".
"The principle seems to apply to those couples with a huge earning capacity where there is a surplus of money over and above what they both reasonably need.
"The fact the award will be reviewed after four years shows the court expects her to set up a business or become self-sufficient in some way.
Lord Justice Thorpe said it was wrong in principle for the earner to control the accumulated wealth but the other party must invest the award sensibly.
In the initial settlement, Ms Parlour was given two mortgage-free houses worth more than �1m and a �250,000 lump sum.
Joshua Rozenberg, legal editor of the Daily Telegraph, told BBC News the judgement specifically applies to wealthy couples who have "very little capital" but "a great deal of earnings".
Maintenance payments over a few years, by one partner who has substantial earnings, is a means of ensuring that both parties could "go their own way" and make a "clean break", he said.
The onus will be on Ms Parlour to save and invest wisely to ensure her future independence, he added.
She also receives the �12,500 sum Mr Parlour pays annually foreach of the children, aged eight, six and four.
In January, High Court Family Division judge Mr Justice Bennett increased Mrs Parlour's annual maintenance to �250,000 from her ex-husband's initial offer of �120,000.
He ruled that the offer had not reflected the major part she had played in persuading Parlour to "grow up" and drop the hard-drinking "laddish" culture that existed among certain Arsenal players.
Dyfed-Powys Police Chief Constable Terry Grange said the plan was "Alice Through the Looking Glass stuff".
The government wants to merge the four Welsh forces into one unit.
Mr Grange supports the move in principle, but accused the Home Office of a lack of "financial, professional and political backing".
He believes a single force is the best option for Wales, but insists the huge cost of restructuring must be paid for by the government.
Ministers have told force leaders to borrow money to meet the merger costs, and Home Secretary Charles Clakre has offered extra money to police authorities which volunteer to merge their forces on 23 December.
But the Association of Police Authorities (APA) has accused Mr Clarke of trying to "bribe" forces into submission.
Earlier this month MPs on the Welsh Affairs select committee questioned the chief constables of the four Welsh forces - South Wales, Dyfed-Powys, Gwent and North Wales - and their police authorities about the planned changes.
It followed the restructuring proposals announced by Mr Clarke in November, which could see the number of forces in England and Wales could be reduced from 43 to 12.
When the Wales chief constables were questioned, the only one not supporting the plans was Richard Brunstrom of North Wales Police.
He agreed there was "a very great deal of logic" to a single force but questioned the flexibility of the proposals.
On Friday Mr Brunstrom told the BBC his biggest concern was "the rush".
APA chairman Bob Jones said on Friday no police authorities would agree to the plans unless Mr Clarke promised the government would meet all the merger costs.
"We will not be bullied or bribed into making decisions in three months about changes to our police forces which have done a good job for the last 30 years," he said.
The APA estimates the reorganisation would cost between �500m and �600m.
It said borrowing money to meet the costs would lead to less money available for local policing, because forces would have to pay interest.
It wants an assurance that council taxpayers would not have to "dig deeper into their pockets to pay for mergers".
Failures that led to the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire, exposed the police to criticism for poor communication between forces.
There are also concerns some forces are too small to deal with the threat of international terrorism.
But the Tories and Lib Dems argue the reorganisation will break the link between police and local communities.
Cottaging is a slang term for gay sex in a public toilet or using such a facility to arrange sex elsewhere.
The university even considered installing CCTV in the toilet block in the basement of its main library.
The final straw was an e-mail sent to some students from an external bulletin board, advertising the 'venue'.
"I understand that this problem has been going on a number of years," said a member of Queen's staff in an e-mail from March 2006 obtained by BBC News.
"There have been suspicions of similar misuse of these facilities over the years and they have been closed for periods and spot checked by security staff at other times.
In February of this year, following an article in a student newspaper, the Gown, the university denied that the closure was linked to concerns over cottaging.

Leeds United's Alan Smith illuminated an experimental friendly encounter as England were held to a draw by Portugal at Villa Park.
Smith was handed his first England start by coach Sven-Goran Eriksson - and responded in style with a vibrant display.
Eriksson will have been pleased with England's first 45 minutes, but once again his side delivered a second-half performance lacking in threat.
England failed to score a goal in the second period during the World Cup, and rarely looked like hitting the target a second time as the game progressed.
And Eriksson will once again be left open to charges of reducing friendly fixtures to the status of meaningless training exercises with a procession of substitutes after half time.
Leeds United's Lee Bowyer was given his first cap after a lengthy England exile - and he made a lively start to his international career.
But he was over-shadowed by his Elland Road team-mate Smith, who posed a constant threat to the Portugal defence.
England were occasionally caught out by the slick passing of the Portuguese, with Real Madrid superstar Luis Figo prominent.
But Eriksson will have been satisfied with England's first half-work - capped by a brilliant goal from Smith after 39 minutes.
It was an England goal fashioned in Leeds, with Bowyer's inviting cross providing the perfect opportunity for Smith to score with a spectacular diving header.
England's momentum was inevitably disturbed by Eriksson's now traditional rash of half-time substitutions, with Blackburn debutant David Dunn one of four changes.
And as England regrouped, Portugal almost took advantage when Nuno Gomes hit the woodwork twice in the space of seconds in the 47th minute.
He directed a header on to the top of the crossbar with goalkeeper David James helpless, then hit the outside of the post.
Portugal, who made nine half-time changes of their own, settled quicker and were applying pressure to England.
Eriksson decided to re-shuffle England's pack again on the hour, with Bowyer one of three departures after a satisfactory international introduction.
And it was a link between two of the replacements, Dunn and Joe Cole, that almost brought a second goal after 63 minutes, only for Emile Heskey to shoot wide off balance.
England had looked unusually vulnerable from set pieces, and it was no surprise when Portugal equalised from a corner with 12 minutes remaining.
Defender Costinha was the scorer, powering a header past Owen Hargreaves on the line.
The plans, which were approved by the Isleworth and Brentford area planning committee, include putting a roof over the Ealing Road end for the first time.
The original application was turned down in December to allow for more talks with local residents.
The work will be funded by a grant from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund.

The number one remix of Presley's single, A Little Less Conversation, his 18th UK chart-topper, ensured he stayed at the top of the earnings league.
Sales of his album have reached the 100 million mark, according to the Recording Association of America (RIAA), as records such as Heart and Soul, The Rock 'n' Roll Era, and It's Christmas Time continue to sell.
A new four-CD box set, Elvis Today, Tomorrow and Forever, is due to be released in the US in September.

Forty-one percent of those questioned support the UK adopting the Alternative Vote in place of first-past-the-post.
But an equal number (41%) of people said they oppose the move to AV.
A referendum on whether to change how Westminster MPs are selected will take place on 5 May after the legislation received royal assent on Wednesday
Some 63% of those polled said a referendum on changing the system is a waste of time and money when there are other pressing needs in the country.
Newsnight commissioned the poll to assess public feeling about government plans to hold a referendum on whether to change the electoral system.
In the referendum, which the government hopes to hold in May, the public will be asked whether they want to replace the existing first-past-the-post system for electing MPs to Westminster with a method known as the Alternative Vote (AV).
Under the current system the candidate who gets most votes in a constituency is elected as its MP.
If no-one gets 50% of votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their backers' second choices allocated to those remaining.
This process continues until one candidate has at least 50% of all votes in that round.
In its poll Newsnight asked whether people thought "the system of electing MPs to the House of Commons needs a major overhaul".
Sixty-five percent of those polled agreed with the statement, 25% disagreed and 10% said they did not know.
However, when asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement that "it is a waste of time and money holding a referendum on changing the system of electing MPs to the House of Commons when there are so many other pressing needs in the country", 63% agreed.
Thirty-two percent disagreed with the statement, and 5% said they did not know.
When asked whether the UK should adopt AV rather than continuing to use first-past-the-post, 41% said Yes, 41% said No and 18% said they do not know.
Critics of the first-past-the-post system say it discriminates against smaller parties - despite getting 23% of the vote in the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats only won 9% of seats.
Defenders of the current system say first-past-the post generally leads to strong government, while a change to AV or proportional representation could make coalition governments the norm rather than the exception.
Eleven percent said they did not know.
Peers have voted to reinstate a clause which would mean a referendum on the Westminster voting system would only be binding if 40% of the public took part.
MPs removed the measure from the bill authorising the referendum on Tuesday but the Lords have defied them, backing it by a majority of 62 votes.
The two Houses now face a showdown over whether the measure will make it into the bill as its final terms are agreed.
The bill must become law by Thursday if the referendum is to go ahead on 5 May.
Sinn Fein have still to call their ARDESH, their annual conference to determine their detailed policy, but to be fair to their leaders, both Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness have made it clear that they do see the Party endorsing the rule of law and policing.

Professor Darvill explains what is happening at the Stonehenge dig
The team has reached sockets that once held bluestones - smaller stones, most now missing or uprooted, which formed the site's original structure.
The researchers believe that the bluestones could reveal that Stonehenge was once a place of healing.
The dig is the first to take place at Stonehenge for more than 40 years.
The team now needs to extract organic material from these holes to date when the stones first arrived.
Professor Geoff Wainwright explains why the dig is taking place
The two-week excavation is being funded by the BBC and filmed for a special Timewatch programme to be broadcast in the autumn.
Professors Darvill and Wainwright say that finding out more about the history of the bluestones could be key to solving the mystery of why the 4,500-year-old landmark was erected.
They believe that the bluestones, which were transported 250km (150 miles) from the Preseli Hills in Wales to the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, were brought to the site because the ancient people believed they had healing properties.
Professor Geoffrey Wainwright said the site could have been a "Neolithic Lourdes".
The giant sarsen "goal posts", which came from about 20km (12 miles) away, were thought to have arrived much later.
These include a beaker pottery fragment, Roman ceramics and ancient stone hammers.

Islamabad has said that its major military offensive against the Taliban in the tribal region of South Waziristan has been completed.
Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani also suggested the operation might now move north to the Orakzai region, where many militants are thought to have fled.

A 2,700-year-old statue of the Egyptian king Taharqa has reportedly been found in the basement of the God's House Tower archaeological museum in Southampton, after being ignored for a century.
Staff used it to lean their bicycles against - but no-one realised the 27-inch statue's importance until two Egyptologists came to visit the museum.
They contacted Vivian Davies, keeper of Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum, who travelled from London to see the statue and pronounced it an "incredibly exciting" find.
Mr Davies said the piece was an important piece of Kushite art dating back to the 7th Century BC.
The king is shown as a god marching forward although the feet, lower left leg, much of the left arm and parts of the head-dress are missing.
It is still a mystery how such an old and rare artefact came to Southampton.
Highlighting the issues facing one particular group of school children is always a tricky matter.
Yet this is exactly what Saturday's conference on "London Schools and the Black Child" is doing.
Its organiser, the Labour MP Diane Abbott, says she has had to fight hard to get government, schools and parents to recognise that children of African and African-Caribbean descent have particular needs which are not being met by the school system.
But perhaps we have now got to the point where a simple "colour blind" policy is not only not helping those it is meant to protect, but may be putting them at a disadvantage.
But by the start of secondary school they are starting to fall behind and statistics show that black African-Caribbean pupils are between three and six times more likely to be expelled from school.
Although there is an absence of detailed statistics, GCSE results also show that African-Caribbean pupils do less well than other ethnic groups in formal examinations.
Government statistics on the proportion of students getting five good GCSEs or their equivalent show the pattern.
For white students the figure in 2000 was 50%, for Asian students it was 49% but for black students it was 37%.
Where it is possible to do so, a further breakdown of these figures produces interesting patterns.
Clearly social class, poverty and whether or not children speak English in the home is a factor in educational achievement.
Bangladeshi immigration to Britain, for example, is mostly more recent than immigration from India.
But such sensitivities, while they must be observed, should not mean - according to Diane Abbott - that we simply lump all ethnic minority students under the umbrella term Black.
The evidence is pretty thin (and this highlights the failure of the education authorities to collect statistics based on ethnic-origin), but an Ofsted report in 1996 did suggest that "pupils of Black African background often achieve relatively higher results than their peers of Black Caribbean origin".
All this suggests to me that, however well-intentioned "colour-blind" policies are, they are not very helpful in finding solutions.
However, as soon as you identify one group as having particular problems you run into criticism.
When I wrote about the issues facing African-Caribbean boys this week, I was told I was contributing to the problem by focussing on the negative image of Caribbean students.
Such complaints are made with genuine feeling and I understand why they are made.
But if, as Diane Abbott believes, the first step in doing something about the average under-achievement of African-Caribbean pupils is to openly recognise the problem, then I don't see any alternative to running the risk of political-incorrectness or of appearing to focus on negatives.
Prices of the boxes, which are used to store government papers securely, ranged from �385 to �750 each.
Figures were collected by John Hemming MP who criticised those departments which "squirmed" out of answering.
All ministers are entitled to red boxes, which weigh up to 30lbs and are built to withstand most accidents.
They are best known for being used by ministers to take their work home with them - and are also used to pass important documents from one department to another.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said, with seven ministers, it had one of the biggest teams of all departments.
"The number of boxes ordered by this department reflects the fact that it has one of the broadest remits - and therefore one of the largest ministerial teams in Whitehall," she said.
The next highest spender, according to the results was the Department for Communities and Local Government - formerly the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister - at �7,420 for eight boxes.
The Foreign Office had bought more, but spent less, although it only had figures from 2004, since when it had bought 15 boxes at a total cost of �6,990.
The lowest spending department was the Wales Office, which has only two ministers now many powers are devolved and hasn't ordered any new boxes in five years.
Liberal Democrat MP Mr Hemming asked how many boxes had been bought, at what cost and what tendering process had been used, as part of his campaign to get ministers to answer factual questions.
He said he wanted to ask all departments the same question to see which would respond.
"The point about this question is the answer is slightly embarrassing because the boxes are quite expensive," he told the BBC website.
"My overall impression was some departments are quite cavalier in their willingness to respond, to answer proper parliamentary questions.
Among those he accuses of "squirming" out of a response are the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice - both said it would cost too much to answer the question as the information was not easily accessible.
He used the Freedom of Information Act to ask them to justify their response by disclosing the advice they had been given.
The Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (formerly education) replied that they ordered boxes "as and when they are needed", but failed to say how many.
The Cabinet Office said it had only "partial records" and the "specific information requested for the last five years could only be provided at disproportionate cost".
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said the way it held its financial and procurement information meant it was not possible to answer Mr Hemming's request, without "breaching the cost limit for answering Parliamentary questions" - which is �700.

President of the National Union of Mineworkers Joe Gormley is confident the government's intervention will avert the threatened national miners' strikes.
Secretary of State for Energy David Howell made the concessions at two hours' of crisis talks in Whitehall involving union leaders and Department of Trade and Industry officials.
At the negotiations - brought forward several days by the government - Mr Howell acknowledged the miners' main demands about coal imports and subsidies to the National Coal Board.
The government agreed to reduce coal imports from eight million to five-and-a-half million tonnes over the next year and to provide more money for the Coal Board, struggling under the withdrawal of operating subsidies after the 1980 Coal Industry Act.
As a result the Coal Board has dropped the programme of pit closures it announced on 10 February.
Mr Gormley is due to meet the 25-member executive of the NUM tomorrow morning and says he will advise against an indefinite strike by the nation's 240,000 miners.
His views are shared by much of the coal industry's left-wing and over half the country's coalfields are already affected by unofficial strikes.
Further talks between union leaders and Mr Howell are planned for a week today when he will give more precise details of the scale of the government's assistance.
Some left-wing pits maintained unofficial stoppages and there were pickets outside the NUM headquarters in London.
Militant miners' leaders called off these strikes on 20 February.
The government provided �300m of financial assistance to the industry and prevented official strike action, although pockets of discontent remained.
Joe Gormley resigned as president of the NUM in April 1982 to be replaced by leftwinger Arthur Scargill.
Mr Scargill went on to lead the miners in a year-long strike - the longest ever in the UK - from March 1984, when the Coal Board announced the closure of 20 pits.
Two tries from former New Zealand prop Craig Dowd, plus one from wing John Rudd and a penalty try give Wasps a 15-point lead to take to Sardis Road for the second leg in a fortnight.
Pontypridd were limited to a fine solo try from outside-half Ceri Sweeney, plus 14 points from the boot of Brett Davey.
The visitors struggled to deal with the power of the Wasps pack, whose dominance allowed former Wales scrum-half Rob Howley to control the game for the English side.
Ponty were given an early scare, when Scotland international wing Kenny Logan collected a Sweeney kick and brushed off Gareth Wyatt.
But Sonny Parker was alive to the danger and the Wales centre did well to drag Logan into touch.
There was early concern for Wasps as well with Alex King needing attention to a leg injury, but the fly-half was soon up on his feet with the help of an ice pack.
Wasps exerted much of the early pressure and the visitors were forced to concede a penalty after 14 minutes.
The Londoners opted for a lineout rather than take the penalty kick and former All Black prop Dowd eventually barrelled his way over in the corner, King adding a fine conversion.
Ponty took up the challenge, also opting for a lineout after winning a penalty from the restart, but the Wasps pack disrupted the drive and shoved the Welshmen into touch.
Things got worse for the visitors after 27 minutes, when Jon Bryant spoiled his fine break with a loose pass that fell to Wasps scrum-half Howley.
The former Wales No 9 has lost none of his dynamic acceleration and Howley chipped the ball intelligently down the line and set off in pursuit.
Trailing 14-0 and down to 14 men things looked bleak for Ponty, only for a moment of brilliance from Sweeney to hand his side a lifeline.
Robert Sidoli did the early good work, stripping possession from man-of-the-match Joe Worsley - one of the England flanker's few mistakes - before feeding his fly-half.
Sweeney set off on a jinking run, was half-held by two Wasps tacklers but pirouetted clear to dive over under the posts, Davey converting.
Stung by the set-back, Wasps hit back almost immediately thanks to a bullocking run from wing Rudd that sucked in the Ponty defenders.
Howley picked and sniped, only to be held just short by flanker Richard Parks, but Dowd was on hand to claim his second try, King having no problem with the simple conversion.
A Davey penalty just before the break got Ponty into double figures but Wasps still held a healthy upper hand.
The visitors had to weather another sustained Wasps onslaught after half-time, before breaking out to earn another penalty shot.
Wales prop Gethin Jenkins burst through from a lineout before giving a superb reverse pass to Michael Owen in support.
Wasps infringed as the backrow went to ground and Davey claimed another three points.
The Pontypridd full-back and King then exchanged penalties, as the defensive efforts of both sides limited scoring opportunities to long-range efforts.
Wasps maintained a stranglehold on territory though, and only a mixture of stout Welsh defence and poor handling from the Londoners kept the scoring down, King's second penalty the only reward.
But with seven minutes remaining, Lawrence Dallaglio produced a moment of pure quality to shatter Ponty's resistance.
The England No 8 burst away from the base of a scrum, popped the ball to full-back Mark van Gisbergen on the burst, who in turn gave the scoring pass to Rudd for a converted try.
Davey managed one last penalty in injury time after Wasps hooker Trevor Leota ignored the offside line, but the 15-point deficit will be a lot to claw back in the return at Sardis Road.
This makes Nereus the deepest-diving vehicle currently in service and the first vehicle to explore the Marianas Trench since 1998.
The unmanned vehicle is remotely operated by pilots aboard a surface ship via a lightweight tether.
Its thin, fibre-optic tether to the research vessel Kilo Moana allows the submersible to make deep dives and be highly manoeuvrable.
Nereus can also be switched into a free-swimming, autonomous vehicle.
"With a robot like Nereus, we can now explore virtually anywhere in the ocean," said Andy Bowen, project manager and principal developer of the sub at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).
The Challenger Deep is the deepest-known part of the ocean, and part of the Marianas Trench near the island of Guam in the west Pacific.
As a result, only two vehicles have ever made the trip to its crushing depths.
In January 1960, Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh made the first and only manned voyage in a Swiss-built bathyscaphe known as the Trieste.
The vessel consisted of a 2m-diameter (6ft) steel sphere containing the crew suspended below a huge 15m-long (50ft) tank of petrol, designed to provide buoyancy.
During the nine-hour mission, the two men spent just 20 minutes on the ocean floor; enough time to measure the depth as 10,916m (35,813 ft).
No manned submersible has ever repeated the dive.
However, 35 years later, a Japanese remote-controlled vehicle called Kaiko returned, setting a depth record for unmanned exploration.
Unlike Nereus, Kaiko had to rely on a cable connected to a ship at the surface for power and control.
The Japanese craft was lost in 2003 on an unrelated dive when a cable connecting it to its control ship snapped.
Currently, the deepest-rated vehicles are able to descend to 6,500m, allowing scientists access to 95% of the seafloor.
Nereus aims to change this to 100%, whilst also allowing scientists to survey a much larger area than vehicles like Kaiko.
Nereus can be transformed into a remote-controlled vehicle (animation courtesy of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)

The cancellation of Newcastle's listing is expected to take place on 18 July.
Mr Ashley, who runs the Sportsworld chain and Lillywhites, is one of many investors lured by the world's richest football league.
In the past few months investors, mostly from overseas, have swooped for clubs including Liverpool, Aston Villa and West Ham and Birmingham.
He later convinced chairman Freddy Shepherd to sell his 28% stake in the Premiership football club.
Analysts said that football clubs were seen as cash cows by many investors, especially after they re-negotiated overseas TV rights.
Despite not winning any silverware since 1969, apart from being awarded the Intertoto Cup in 2006, Newcastle is one of the UK's best-known and best-supported clubs, giving owners a large market for merchandising.
Newcastle is Europe's 13th wealthiest club by annual revenues.
Last month the club appointed former Bolton boss Sam Allardyce as manager.
He makes the comment in a book to be published in October, Gordon Burns' On The Way To Work, in which he talks frankly about his life and work.
"Charles Saatchi believed he could affect art values with buying power," Hirst says in the book.
Charles Saatchi was an early champion of Hirst and has bought pieces by many young British artists.
Hirst's attack on Saatchi, who bought one of the artist's sculptures, Hymn, for �1m in 2000, will surprise many who have observed the patron's buying policy - and feel that he has been too close to Hirst and other young artists.
Karen Wright, editor of Modern Painters, defends Saatchi from criticisms from both sides.
"Saatchi doesn't buy indiscriminately - he has a very good eye," she told BBC News Online.
"He buys in mass, but he buys early and I think that's an admirable quality in a patron.
In the book, Hirst also has sharp words for another champion of contemporary British art, Tate Modern director Nicholas Serota.
"I'm not Nick Serota's barrel-organ monkey," he is quoted as saying.
The book is also said to quote the artist extensively on his turbulent life and his experiences with drink and drugs.
Gleason appeared in more than 60 films, often playing authority figures, including the angry head teacher in 1980s hit The Breakfast Club.
His more recent roles included cameo parts in Friends and Seinfeld.
"Whenever you were with Paul, there was never a dull moment," said his wife Susan Gleason.
Among Gleason's other film credits were Die Hard, Johnny Be Good, Van Wilder and Not Another Teen Movie.
He was a minor league baseball player before turning to acting, learning from the late Lee Strasberg at the famous Actors Studio in New York.
His wife said the cancer that killed him was one that was often linked to asbestos.
Ashley X was born with severe and permanent brain damage, called static encephalopathy.
The nine-year-old has the mental ability of a three-month-old baby and cannot walk or talk.
Her parents argue that keeping her "frozen" as a girl rather than letting her go through puberty and growing into a woman will give her a better life.
They authorised doctors to remove her uterus to prevent menstruation, to limit her breast growth through the removal of breast buds so that she would not experience discomfort when lying down, and give her doses of hormones to stop her growing taller.
Opponents have accused Ashley's parents of "Frankenstein-esque" behaviour - of maiming the child for the sake of convenience.
"If people have concerns about Ashley's dignity, she will retain more dignity in a body that is healthier, more of a comfort to her, and more suited to her state of development.
"Free of menstrual cramps, free of the weight of large and fully-developed breasts, and with a smaller, lighter body that is better suited to constant lying down and to getting moved around"
Douglas Diekema from the University of Washington in Seattle was on the ethics committee that gave the go-ahead for Ashley's treatment.
"In Britain, half of families with disabled children live in poverty and eight in ten say they are at breaking point � more likely to be in debt, less likely to be able to afford a holiday or visit friends or live at much beyond a subsistence existence.
"When parents face such trying circumstances, it is small wonder that they consider desperate measures.
"We have a care crisis in this country, with a lack of support for a decent and dignified family life that is placing unbearable strain on people and families.
To date, the controversial method has been tried in a small number of cases, sometimes to dramatic effect.
But the technique has the potential to be used much more widely, three US experts argue in the journal Science.
As DNA databases expand, policy makers need to consider the method's ethical and legal dimensions, they warn.
"Normally one would look for a perfect match between crime scene [DNA] evidence and a known offender in a database," co-author Frederick Bieber, of Harvard Medical School in Boston, US, told the Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service.
"Very close but not perfect matches might indicate, with some reliability, that crime scene evidence was derived from somebody very closely related to somebody in the databank.
Dr Bieber along with colleagues Charles Brenner and David Lazer carried out mathematical simulations to assess the potential of "kinship analysis" for identifying promising leads in forensic investigations.
"We simulated real families using the genetic frequencies of the markers used in forensic investigations throughout the world," Dr Bieber said.
Familial searching was crucial to police solving the 1988 murder of 16-year-old Lynette White in Cardiff, UK.
A search of the National DNA Database for a rare gene variant found in a specimen recovered from the crime scene identified a 14-year-old boy with a similar genetic profile.
However, some researchers have expressed worries over how familial searching might be applied on a larger scale.
"My concern is that this evidence, if it ever comes to that, would be totally mishandled; and, in all likelihood, its value would be overstated by our forensic labs," commented Dr Laurence D Mueller, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Irvine.
"When you look through a database, one of the things people are concerned about is that you are comparing the genetic profile of thousands of people to the profile in an evidence sample.
The Science magazine authors themselves note that evidence of a DNA match can be misleading and does not necessarily prove guilt.
In addition, they say, this novel technique potentially amplifies existing disparities in the criminal justice system where arrests and convictions differ widely based on race, ethnicity, geographic location and social class.
In recent years dozens of cinema houses have closed or have been replaced by shopping centres.
Experts say falling production standards and the video and DVD culture have lowered the appeal of Pakistani movies.
But at least now some young film-makers are trying to carve out a new future with creative, less commercial works.
Lollywood, as the Lahore-based industry is known, still churns out almost a film a week.
But it is not enough to keep the industry going in the wake of competition from better produced movies from elsewhere in the region.
Almost all Lollywood movies are musicals, much like their counterparts in Bombay, also known as Mumbai.
But there the comparison ends.
Actress-turned-film-maker Sangeeta has seen the ups and downs of Lollywood over the past three decades.
Now she believes the competition from India is overwhelming.
"The budget we shoot for a whole film is used by film-makers in India on filming just one song," she said.
Indian films are actually banned in Pakistan.
But given the bustling bootleg markets, it is clear the ban is virtually worthless
The latest Indian and Western films arrive here on video or DVD within days of their theatrical release.
A salesman in Lahore's bootleg market told the BBC they were actually cheaper to buy than Pakistani videos because the latter were protected by copyright.
But many people argue that it is not just competition from bootlegging and cable television that has stifled film-making in Pakistan.
They see Lollywood's low production values, formulaic story lines and a propensity for gratuitous violence and obscenity as being responsible for driving away film-goers.
But there is some hope.
Over the past few years a new breed of young and independent film-maker has emerged to experiment.
Farjad Nabi is one whose eclectic style has won him a number of awards at regional festivals.
He says there is no reason why less commercial films cannot do well in Pakistan.
Mr Nabi says that since Indian art movies have been doing well on video and DVD in Pakistan, there is no reason why creative work from Pakistan cannot attract attention.
Some of these independent film-makers have made the most of the cheaper digital technology available to produce high-quality movies.
So far none has been a huge commercial success, but some have earned recognition both at home and abroad.
At December's Kara Film Festival, organised by independent Pakistani film-makers, the message from the younger generation was clear.
Regardless of the difficulties, film is a passion they cannot live without.
The inquiries are potentially embarrassing for the security service and the government, because both cases raise questions about how long intelligence officers have known about the pair's activities.
It has also emerged that Symonds was not unknown to the authorities.
Code-named Scot by his KGB paymasters, the former Detective Sergeant was allegedly recruited after fleeing Britain in 1969 under suspicion of corruption.
But in 1985 he gave a newspaper interview admitting his treachery, and alleging that the intelligence service had shown no interest in talking to him.
Mr Symonds was revealed as a spy in the same documents which exposed great-grandmother Melita Norwood as one of the USSR's top Cold War agents.
The documents, which were handed over to the British authorities in 1992, are expected to lead to many more revelations in the coming weeks.
But those made so far have raised questions about why the authorities have taken no action over the past seven years.
Tom King, former Conservative defence secretary, and now chairman of the parliamentary security and intelligence committee, is to launch an investigation into the matter.
He suggested that no action may have been taken because there had been much more information in the files to investigate.
Conservative MP Michael Howard, who was home secretary from 1993 to 1997, said he had been unaware of Mrs Norwood's existence.
The revelations came to light when a BBC team was researching the forthcoming documentary The Spying Game.
At any one time there are dozens of large construction projects under way in a city the size of London.
Each one generates vast amounts of clay, topsoil and rubble which has to be dug out to enable the builders to put in the foundations of the new edifice.
So what happens to it all?
For years large quantities of it ended up simply being dumped in landfill sites.
But now, in a more environmentally-conscious age, imaginative solutions are being provided and one of the most innovative has taken shape beside the A40, the main road leading from London out towards Oxford and Birmingham.
Mr Fink realised that a number of huge civil engineering projects were about to get under way in west London, including the redevelopment of Wembley stadium and a giant shopping centre at White City, and knew the builders would need to get rid of large amounts of what is known in the trade as spoil or "muck away".
But eventually they persuaded the council and the locals that the project could be done without harming anyone's health or affecting house prices.
Northala Fields, the new park which includes the hills, has now opened to the public and has been getting a positive reaction locally.
When it is completely finished it will offer two playgrounds, a large area for walking and several ponds for fishing and the hills also have the added benefit of helping to muffle traffic noise.
As for Mr Fink's firm, Form Associates, they are hoping to recreate the success of Northala with a huge development in Manchester, Irwell City Park.

Jake the Jack Russell went missing while chasing rabbits near Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales.
He was gone so long his owners were worried their pooch was dead.
They recognised him from posters his owners had put up.
Grateful owner Jill Thomas, 52, said it was "incredible he survived".
Mrs Thomas said she and husband were "so glad" to have the six-year-old home.
Vets had to look after Jake because he was so skinny, but he's much better now.
Jake's become a bit of a local celebrity after his adventure, and well wishers have sent him cards, presents and a nice juicy bone.
Hull boss Phil Brown admits he gave his players some "harsh realities and a few home truths" at half-time in their 5-1 defeat at Manchester City - and says the lack of pride was a let down to the travelling support.
The 40-year-old spent five years as a player at Sincil Bank before becoming a goalkeeping coach.
Robins assistant manager John Schofield also played for and managed Lincoln until joining Cheltenham in the summer.
Kevin Kilbane joined Sunderland midway through the 1999/2000 season and has been a crucial part of the Republic of Ireland squad since.
The 24-year-old played in all 10 of Ireland's group qualifying matches plus the two play-off games against Iran and scored twice on the way.
But he may not be assured of his place in the starting line-up, following the resurgent form of Damien Duff.
Kilbane started his career at Preston before joining West Bromwich Albion at the start of the 1997/1998 campaign.
Blondie and Talking Heads also found fame after performing at the club which helped launch US punk music.
But a dispute over rent rises led owner Hilly Kristal to lose his lease, more than 30 years after the club opened.
Patti Smith said CBGB was more a "state of mind" than a venue and other clubs would replace it.
Her set included a cover version of Do You Remember Rock N Roll Radio? by The Ramones.
The night before, Debbie Harry and her guitarist Chris Stein of Blondie also performed a farewell set, including Hanging on the Telephone and Call Me.
In its heyday in the 70s and early 80s, CBGB was the cradle of punk rock, the birthplace of the American scene.
There was never anything slick about the club, whose official title CBGB OMFUG stands for Country, Bluegrass, Blues and Other Music for Uplifting Gormandisers.
But for many the closing of CBGB represented a much more significant cultural moment.
It was about the death of an older notion of New York, apparently killed off by money-driven consumerism which all serious punk rockers loathe.
"My belief has been that CBGB represents the last remaining bohemian movement," said John Holmstrom, the founder of Punk Magazine.
Now it is a gentrified area of pricey bars and million-dollar apartment buildings.
The club's founder and owner, Hilly Kristal, was reflective on the demise of his club.
"The emotions are very mixed, you put 30 years of your life into something and it becomes your home.
The research team identified 242 asthmatic people allergic to house dust mite and gave some a homeopathic treatment and others a placebo.
However, they found no improvement in lung function or quality of life between those treated with placebo and those who received homeopathic therapy.
Previous studies have shown this type of homeopathy, where patients are given small amounts of the allergen, are effective in the treatment of hayfever and possibly asthma.
From the original research group, 186 people in Hampshire and Dorset completed the study over 16 weeks.
A report in the British Medical Journal concludes there was no significant difference in response between the two groups.
The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital recently carried out a survey of treatments on asthmatic patients.
It followed up 24 adults and 25 children with asthma and found that 71% of the adults and 80% of the children experienced improvements in their symptoms following homeopathic treatment.
Two thirds of the adults and almost as many of the children reduced their need for inhalers and 60% of the parents of the children reported a decrease in the need to consult their GP for urgent asthma treatments.
Dr Peter Fisher, who practices at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, said this study was not conclusive.
He says homeopathy is about trying out different therapies on patients and not just choosing to give them a small dose of the suspected allergen.
Dr Fisher, who has just been appointed homeopathic physician to the Queen, thinks the study results are a minor setback for homeopathy, which has as many sceptics as admirers.
"Homeopathic medicine is good for different things.
Dr Fisher is an NHS GP and practices both conventional and complementary medicine to suit individual patients.
Any patient can make a complaint about the care they have received or the way they have been treated by NHS staff and organisations.
Under the existing system, patients or their families are expected to follow set procedures.
In the first instance, patients are advised to complain directly to the NHS staff member they are aggrieved with.
The convenor can have the complaint reinvestigated and decide what action should be taken.
They must inform the patient of what action is being taken, if any, giving specific reasons within 20 days of receiving the complaint.
One of the steps the convenor can take is to establish an independent review panel to hear the case.
This panel is headed by a chairman who is appointed by the NHS Executive regional office.
The panel is appointed within four weeks and is supposed to complete its work within 12 weeks.
If the convenor refuses to appoint an review panel or if the patient is unhappy with the outcome of the panel's investigation they can complain to the health ombudsman.
The complaints process has come in for much criticism in recent years from NHS staff and patients not least because of delays in handling cases.
The government is working on plans to make the process more patient-friendly.
Community Health Councils were established in 1974 as part of a policy aimed at giving patients a greater say in how the NHS is run.
They are responsible for providing support to patients who have experienced problems or who have made a complaint concerning the NHS.
They also monitor the provision of service and care to patients throughout the NHS by carrying out studies and investigations.
They act as the patient's voice on consultations on local changes to the NHS, such as a Trust merger, and on government plans to reform the health service.
However, these councils are set to be abolished by 2002 and replaced by the Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service (PALS) under plans put forward by the government in July 2000.
These advocates will also be expected to guide patients and their families through the complaints process, where necessary.
The Health Service Ombudsman investigates complaints about the NHS and is independent of both the government and the health service itself.
Patients can complain to this office if they believe that their complaint has not been addressed effectively through other channels.
The office can investigate complaints against hospitals or community health services.
The type of complaints it examines include those relating to poor service or failure to provide a service; allegations that staff did not follow proper procedures or were rude; and complaints about the care received from doctors, nurses and other health professionals.
The Ombudsman publishes an annual report detailing the number and type of complaints received and how they were dealt with.
There is no appeal against the ombudsman's decision although individuals can complain about how their case was handled.
CHI was set up by the government in 2000 as an inspectorate for the NHS in England and Wales.
Its overriding purpose is to make sure that health care is the safest and best quality it can be and to iron out the variation in standards across the UK.
It can report serious findings about an individual hospital or GP surgery to the Health Secretary which or the Welsh Assembly who can then decide what further action needs to be taken, such as replacing the management team at that organisation.
No matter how gloomy a candidate's prospect, he usually can count on at least one vote - from himself.
"I never hated a place so bad in my life," he says in a thick Vermont country accent.
But while he may not win, statements like these - plus a down-home world view and virtually no political views - have made Fred Tuttle Vermont's favourite cultural icon.
It's a case of life imitating art.
After all, he says, it's the only job in America that requires no previous experience or education and pays $129,500 per year.
Except for his party affiliation, Fred Tuttle's platform and slogan haven't changed.
Called Nosy Parker, it will star one of Fred Tuttle's neighbours, George Lyford, as a vigilant property tax assessor trying to break up local "dens of iniquity".
Vermont assessors should keep their eyes on their jobs.
Army technical experts made safe a partially exploded device which was found inside the perimeter of Hillsborough, County Down on Monday night.
Early reports indicate the device may have been left some time ago by republican dissidents.
Speaking in Cork in the Republic of Ireland, Mr Mandelson said he knew "very little" about the incident.
A Downing Street spokesman played down the significance of the device which he said was "small" and was found well away from the main castle building.
The spokesman said it was a "comparatively minor incident", but was being investigated by the RUC.
Officials have said security was important, and any lessons that needed to be learned from the incident would be taken on board.
A Northern Ireland Office spokesman said Mr Mandelson was not in the building at the time of the discovery of the device by a farmer cutting hay.
However, if the device had lain undiscovered for some time it could have been in the grounds when the Prince of Wales was meeting victims of the Troubles at a garden party last week.
The castle has been the focus of a security operation since the device was found shortly after 2100 BST on Monday, just inside the boundary wall of a field on the Moira Road.
A follow-up search of the area around the site is being carried out.
"Clearly this indicates there is ongoing terrorist activity in Northern Ireland.
The house and grounds of Hillsborough Castle play host to many of Northern Ireland's official occasions.
Prince Charles' visit followed a ceremony earlier this year when the Queen presented the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the George Cross at a special event in the castle grounds.
Republican dissident groups opposed to the peace process, which include the Real IRA and Continuity IRA have carried out a number of recent attacks on army installations throughout Northern Ireland.
No-one has been injured in the attacks.
The American, 30, tested positive for unusual levels of testosterone after winning stage 17 of the race.
Speaking at a news conference in Madrid, Landis said the testosterone was "absolutely natural and produced by my own organism".
Landis, of the Phonak team, awaits the result of a B sample test this week.
He said he would request "within hours" that a second sample he gave be tested but did not know when the result of that would be known.
"I want it (the result) to be made public immediately, I see no reason why not," he said.
Landis said he has naturally high testosterone levels and will agree to undergo tests to prove his case.
"We will explain to the world why this is not a doping case but a natural occurrence," he said.
Landis produced one of the most memorable rides in Tour history when he stormed to victory in stage 17 by almost six minutes.
The win put him back into contention for the yellow jersey a day after his chances looked to have evaporated when he cracked on the final climb of stage 16.
And Landis remained insistent he was the worthy champion in Paris last Sunday.
Tara Lipscombe, from Dartford, was walking with her mother across Dartford Heath in Kent at about 1700 BST on Tuesday when the incident happened.
Police say the radio-controlled plane appears to have flown out of control and hit the girl.
Tara was badly injured and taken by air ambulance to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford where she died at about 2000 BST.
The plane was being flown by a 55-year-old man from south London who was spoken to at the scene by officers from Kent Police.
Police said Tara's family had left the area and were staying with friends or family.
"The family are quite clearly devastated by what has happened," a spokesman said.
An investigation is being carried out into the circumstances of the incident, but police say early indications suggest it was "a very tragic accident".
They have not yet confirmed where the incident happened in relation to the designated area for flying.
The owner and operator of the model plane were both in shock after the incident, according to one witness.
John Lee, 53, was walking his three dogs when he came across the two men.
He spotted police cars and an ambulance - and asked a man walking towards him what was going on.
A second man, who the owner said was a friend who had been flying his plane, also appeared to be in shock, Mr Lee said.
Mr Lee, a model aeroplane enthusiast for 40 years, said about 30 people regularly flew planes on the 130-hectare heath but there should not be more than four in the air together.
The land, owned by Dartford Borough Council, has had a designated area for model flying since 1997.
Posters have now been put up around the heath asking people not to fly planes.
A police spokesman said the Acrowot petrol-powered aircraft involved in the incident would be examined by police and, if necessary, by outside experts.
The shutter is needed to protect the finest optical-quality window ever built into a spacecraft and the installation allowed the window to be uncovered earlier than planned.
Thomas Jones and Robert Curbeam carried out a seven-hour space walk during which they made such good progress that they were able to get on with work scheduled for later in their mission.
Nasa pictures showed them moving a docking port on to the end of the Destiny module, ready for more building work during future missions, and being photographed by their colleagues inside the lab.
The space walkers also fitted the base for a Canadian-built robot arm, due to arrive on a future mission.
They will carry out a third and final walk later in the week, Nasa said.
The Atlantis crew met the current three residents of the ISS on Friday and spent their first full day inside Destiny on Sunday.
The tasks for the crew include work on how humans cope in zero-gravity.
Partners in the space station project include the United States, Russia and the European Space Agency.
Among those who filed their nominations at the offices of the election commission in Colombo were the two main candidates - President Chandrika Kumaratunga and opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
On Sunday, an election meeting addressed by UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was bombed, killing two and wounding more than 40 people.
Both leading candidates called for an end to the violence and appealed for a peaceful election.
"We ask everyone to support the government to hold a peaceful election," she said.
Her main rival echoed her words.
"On 21st December I will take this country to the 21st century," Mr Wickremesinghe declared.
The poll comes in the wake of heavy fighting in the north between Sri Lankan forces and Tamil Tiger separatist rebels.
Analysts have suggested that heavy losses suffered by the military at the hands of the Tamil Tigers could hurt Ms Kumaratunga's chances of re-election.
Three UNP activists were hurt when gunmen opened fire on a party office near the election commission in Colombo.
"Forty-two rounds were fired at our office," UNP legislator Ravi Karunayake told reporters.
Supporters of the ruling party were also blamed for defacing and pulling down opposition posters and cut-outs along the route to the election commission.
Only cut-outs of President Kumaratunga were left standing.
On Monday, the UNP asked for extra security for Mr Wickremesinghe, after his narrow escape the previous day.
Ms Kumaratunga's ruling People's Alliance faces its main challenge from the UNP, but the radical left JVP (People's Liberation Front) could come into play in the event of a close contest.
Sri Lanka's minority Tamils did not field a candidate after failing to arrive at a consensus on a common contender.
The decision follows a year-long review of operations in Grimsby, Hull and Lowestoft by parent group Unilever.
News that the Grimsby plant will close early next year was broken to staff at a special meeting on Thursday morning.
The Hull fish fingers and frozen peas factory and Lowestoft's potato production plant will both remain fully operational following the business review, Unilever said.
But the Grimsby site was deemed to be too small to be competitive in the ready meals market.
Unilever said it would have preferred to sell the factory to a specialist third party, but efforts to do this had failed.
The company also looked at a proposal to invest in the site, but decided this would not be economically competitive in the long term.
Instead production at the plant will be transferred to selected specialist large-scale suppliers.
Grimsby general manager Roger Norrington said the firm was disappointed that efforts to find a buyer for the factory as a going concern had not succeeded.
The prime minister's official spokesman said it is due to report back at the end of the year, with the evaluation due to run until the autumn.
PM Gordon Brown said that only a small fraction of pubs had embraced 24-hour drinking and it had not caused any significant increase in arrests.
His spokesman said the government would look at the law in "a sober way".
Speaking to journalists, the spokesman said Mr Brown would not be "widening" the remit of the Home Office review, but said he wanted to "examine in an objective way the evidence".
Earlier, during his press conference, Mr Brown had been asked if he would reverse the policy on 24-hour drinking, in a similar fashion to government moves to re-examine the supercasino decision and cannabis classification.
Mr Brown said they had been "very specific issues".
He recalled a Mark Twain joke about having arrived in Nevada, with its gambling, drinking and womanising, from a Puritan background.
It says the increasing numbers of laws coming from Brussels are threatening Britain's independence.
The party particularly objects to Europe's interference in tax policies and believes that Britain should be ruled by its own elected parliament while enjoying free trade with EU nations
While UKIP takes a firm line on immigration - an end to the "open-door policy" that comes with EU membership - it says it is "non-discriminatory".
UKIP formed in 1993, but in its early days was overshadowed by the well-financed Referendum Party, led by Sir James Goldsmith, which was wound up soon after the 1997 election.
Since then it has made gains at successive European elections, winning its first three seats in 1999 with 7% of the vote.
The party built on that in 2004, winning 12 seats and pushing the Lib Dems into fourth place.
The 2009 poll saw their total grow to 13 seats and the party pushed Labour into third place.
General elections, however, have been a very different story and in 2005 the party failed to make the breakthrough it had been hoping for.
The party will be hoping for a big improvement this time around under new leader Lord Pearson of Rannoch.
UKIP's website puts its 2005 electoral "slip" down to "internal difficulties" - the party has been dogged by in-fighting over the years.
Founder Alan Sked quit before the 1999 elections after arguing the party should refuse seats in the "gravy train" of the Strasbourg Parliament.
Shortly after that, the national executive lost a no confidence vote and leader Michael Holmes resigned, though he remained an MEP.
Mr Knapman took over the role of leader in 2002, but in 2004, a new pretender to the crown - former Labour MP and chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk - arrived in a flurry of media publicity to shake things up once again.
Before long he was openly jockeying for the leadership, but when Mr Knapman refused to stand aside, Mr Kilroy-Silk went instead.
In 2006, Mr Knapman retired, to be replaced by Nigel Farage, a polished media performer who pledged to make UKIP a "truly representative party", ending its image as a single issue pressure group.
But, despite success at the 2009 European elections and raising UKIP's profile, he surprised his own party conference in September 2009 by standing down as leader of the party - although he continues to lead its group of Euro MPs.
Eton-educated Lord Pearson was Mr Farage's favourite choice to replace him but the peer is not afraid to be controversial, inviting controversial Dutch MP Geert Wilders to show an anti-Islam film in the House of Lords - prompting angry scenes outside Parliament.
UKIP itself does not shy from controversy, recently calling for a ban on face-covering veils like the burka being worn in public.
And Mr Farage is not afraid of ruffling feathers in Europe where he continues to make headlines, most recently for telling the President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy he had "the charisma of a damp rag".
Danny Jordaan, the president of the World Cup organising committee, was speaking a day after a stampede at a 2010 qualifier in Ivory Coast.
At least 19 people were killed before the Elephants game with Malawi.
Jordaan says many African fans buy their tickets only when they reach the stadium, and often arrive late to do that, creating an impatient crowd outside that can spark an incident.
When the World Cup comes to South Africa in 2010, match tickets will have to be purchased well in advance.
Jordaan says those without tickets will be "stopped kilometres away," and fans will be urged to arrive early.
Welcome to the greatest single sporting occasion on planet earth.
Grammy Award winners Ladysmith Black Mambazo have got the stadium transfixed with a song about rain, while the pitch begins to flood (thankfully, it's another special effect).
It doesn't appear that Nelson Mandela will address the crowd at Soccer City Stadium, but it is fantastic that he is just there.
First sniff of an opening for David Villa, but he's correctly adjudged to be half a yard offside from Pedro's almost brilliant pass.
Horrible touch from Sergio Busquets in a very dangerous place for Spain, but Dirk Kuyt's shot from 30 yards bounces safely into the arms of Iker Casillas.
"The players are really not making this easy for (referee) Howard Webb are they?"
We'll have two minutes of first-half stoppage time at Soccer City.
Arjen Robben turns beautifully away from Xabi Alonso inside the Spain half, but his slide-rule pass to Robin van Persie is just too strong for the Arsenal striker.
Arjen Robben hits a speculative left-footer from 30 yards, but Iker Casillas is paying attention and saves low down to his left.
Xavi gets it up and over the wall, but it's about two feet too high and two feet too wide and Maarten Stekelenburg lets it go past.
The Netherlands take off Dirk Kuyt and send on winger Eljero Elia.
Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso is taken off by Spain and on comes Cesc Fabregas in his place.
Don't go anywhere, these change-arounds are spectacularly rapido.
Now Gregory van der Wiel is into the book for another late challenge on Andres Iniesta.
The Spain players have quick-smart changed out of their dark blue shirts and into their more familiar red ones for the glory shots of them lifting the trophy.
Iniesta drilled his right-foot strike across goal - but the Dutch were incensed after referee Howard Webb had failed to award their side a corner moments earlier when a free-kick took a sizeable deflection off Cesc Fabregas.
However, Euro 2008 champions Spain, who conceded only two goals during the tournament, deserved their victory after gradually taking a grip on a tense and bad-tempered contest that produced 14 yellow cards with Johnny Heitinga sent off on 109 minutes after picking up a second yellow card.
The Dutch, who lost in the 1974 and 1978 finals, were bidding to become the first side since Brazil in 1970 to go through World Cup qualifying and the finals unbeaten.
They had a glorious chance to take the lead in the second half but Arjen Robben, comfortably his team's most potent attacking weapon, could find no way past Spain captain Iker Casillas, who slumped to the floor and cried tears of joy after the final whistle.
Sergio Ramos was equally culpable of a glaring miss for Spain when he headed over and substitute Fabregas, as with Robben before him, also failed to convert a one-on-one chance.
But it was from a through ball by the influential Fabregas that midfielder Iniesta struck making Spain the first team to win a World Cup after losing their opening game of the tournament.
The dramatic finale at Soccer City was in stark contrast to a hugely underwhelming opening 45 minutes, which was a brutal disappointment after the spectacular opening ceremony and moving appearance by former president Nelson Mandela that had preceded it.
The Netherlands could not get a grip on the game but were helped by a spate of yellow cards from referee Webb that disturbed the rhythm of the match.
Webb booked five players in the opening 28 minutes, although several crude challenges left him with little option.
Dutch enforcer Mark van Bommel was booked after going through the back of Iniesta, while Nigel de Jong was lucky to escape red after planting his foot in the chest of Xabi Alonso.
Robben did force a decent save from Casillas with a low left-foot strike after cutting inside during stoppage time.
But the match had degenerated to the extent that Alonso opted to shoot with a free-kick on the wrong side of 40 yards instead of a seeking out a team-mate.
Spain defender Joan Capdevila wasted a good chance shortly after the restart, failing to make contact with a Carles Puyol flick-on.
The bookings continued after the break and the contest occasionally threatened to boil over as the tension appeared to affect the players.
But there were also a few moments of real quality, none more so than a sumptuous through ball from the largely anonymous Wesley Sneijder that played Robben clean through on goal.
Robben delayed his shot but, equally, Casillas stood his ground as long as possible and brilliantly saved with his legs.
It was a head-in-hands moment for Robben, but one quickly followed for Spain when a completely unmarked Ramos headed a corner over the crossbar.
Spain had moved into the ascendancy as the match wore on, with Xavi increasingly influential.
Fabregas replaced Alonso in the 87th minute and quickly made an impression by collecting a superb Iniesta pass, but the Arsenal man could find no way beyond Stekelenberg, who saved brilliantly with his legs.
The complement was returned shortly afterwards but Iniesta opted not to strike from 18 yards and was eventually dispossessed by the excellent Gregory van der Wiel.
Heitinger became the fifth man to be sent off in a World Cup final when he pulled back Iniesta on the edge of the area, giving Webb little choice but to hand him a second caution, and that seemed to spur Spain on for a final effort.
Joris Mathijsen headed over for the Netherlands in what was their only good chance of the extra-time period before Iniesta struck his late and decisive blow.
Projected table based on current scores
Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi told the BBC that Yemen had the will and ability to deal with al-Qaeda, but was undermined by a lack of support.
He estimated that several hundred al-Qaeda members were operating in Yemen and could be planning more attacks.
A Yemen-based branch of the network has claimed it planned the failed attack.
Yemeni officials said Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up the Detroit-bound jet on Christmas Day, was living in Yemen from August until the beginning of December, the official Saba news agency reported.
US officials are said to be concerned there may be more al-Qaeda-trained young men in the country planning to bring down US planes.
In recent weeks, Yemen has launched several major operations against al-Qaeda with US backing, amid fears the troubled country is becoming a major training centre for militants.
In an interview for BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, Mr al-Qirbi said the conflict with al-Qaeda was a priority for his government despite wars with Shia rebels in the north and with separatists in the south.
Yemen was getting some support in this conflict but it was inadequate, he added.
"The United States can do a lot, Britain can do a lot, the European Union can do a lot in that regard," he said.
He said he thought that 200-300 al-Qaeda members were operating in Yemen, but that this was just a rough guess.
"Of course there are a number in Yemen and they may actually plan for attacks as in Detroit," he said.
But Mr al-Qirbi said warnings about the situation made by US officials like Gen David Petraeus, head of Central Command, were overstated and "exaggerated in some media".
Mr Abdulmutallab has been charged with attempting to blow up the Northwest Airlines Airbus A330 from Amsterdam, which had nearly 300 people on board, as it made its final descent into Detroit on Friday.
The 23-year-old, who is being held at a federal prison in the US state of Michigan, was restrained by passengers and crew while allegedly trying to detonate a high-explosive device sewn inside his underwear.
On Monday a web posting by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including a photograph purportedly of Mr Abdulmutallab in front of its banner, said the attack had been a response to US attacks against its operatives.
On Tuesday, an official at the Yemeni foreign ministry said that the Migration and Passport Authority had confirmed that Mr Abdulmutallab arrived in Yemen at the beginning of August to study at the Sanaa Institute for the Arabic Language (SIAL) and left for Ethiopia four months later.
ABC News earlier reported that among the group who planned the alleged attack were two men who were released by the US from its Guantanamo Bay detention centre in November 2007.
Mohammed Atiq al-Harbi, also known as Mohammed al-Awfi, and Said Ali al-Shihri were sent home to Saudi Arabia, where they were admitted to an "art therapy rehabilitation program" and later set free, US and Saudi officials said.
Both men appeared in a video in January along with the man described as the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Nasser Abdul Karim al-Wuhayshi.
James Corden wins best comedy performance for his role in Gavin and Stacey
BBC Three's Gavin and Stacey beat the likes of Strictly Come Dancing and Britain's Got Talent to the audience award, voted for by the public.
Its co-writer and actor James Corden also won best comedy performance.
ITV's Harry Hill won best entertainment performance and programme, while Dame Eileen Atkins beat Cranford co-star Dame Judi Dench to win best actress.
Cranford had led the nominations with four, but Dame Eileen won the costume drama's only prize of the night.
Dame Eileen, who played Miss Deborah Jenkyns in the adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's work, was last nominated for a Bafta TV Award in 1969 and had never previously won.
"I don't do humility very well but I really do have to share this with the ladies of Cranford," she said.
Gavin and Stacey, about the ups and downs of a young couple and their clans, won its awards on the same night that the last episode of the second series went out on BBC Three.
Picking up his prize, Corden thanked his co-writer and co-star Ruth Jones, who plays Nessa in the show.
"She is not just the greatest writer and actress, she is the best friend anyone could hope for and is as much Smithy as I am, and I share this with her," he said.
On accepting the audience award, Jones said she was "absolutely gobsmacked".
Earlier on the red carpet, Corden said they were working on a Christmas special but he did not know if a third series would be made.
Bruce Forsyth talks to David Sillito about receiving Bafta's highest accolade.
Bruce Forsyth received Bafta's highest accolade, the Academy Fellowship, in recognition of his "outstanding body of work".
Graham Norton hosted the Bafta ceremony at the London Palladium.
Andrew Garfield was named best actor for his role in Boy A, Channel 4's drama about a juvenile child-killer.
Jimmy McGovern's The Street was named best drama series for the second year in a row, beating Life On Mars, Rome and Skins.
Channel 4's Britz, a thriller about two young British Muslims, won the best drama serial prize.
Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares was named best feature, Heroes picked up the international prize and Iraq story The Mark of Cain won best single drama.
The best comedy programme prize went to Fonejacker, while Peep Show was crowned best situation comedy.
Ministers from the 15 EU countries agreed the move at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday,.
There are still sharp disagreements on the issue, but an increasing number of British farmers are already choosing to give hens their freedom.
Ministers arriving for the meeting were faced by protesters from welfare groups, sensing a real chance to end what they claim is the cruel practice of battery farming.
Under the agreement, the maximum amount of space allocated per hen in existing cages in EU countries will be increased from 450 to 550 square centimetres from 2003.
Also, from 2003 it will be forbidden to introduce new cages that are not "enriched cages".
With many consumers now prepared to pay a bit more for free range eggs, an increasing number of British farmers are already choosing to do away with battery cages.
A battery farm shed would contain three or four times the number of hens.
Iain Hook, 53, worked with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) at the Jenin refugee camp.
A Palestinian boy was also killed and an Irishwoman was wounded in separate incidents in Jenin refugee camp.
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw called Mr Hook's death a "terrible event" and expressed his condolences to his family and friends.
"We will do everything possible to ensure that there is a full investigation," Mr Straw and the UK International Development Secretary, Clare Short, said in a joint statement.
Some reports speak of a gun battle as troops tried to seize an Islamic Jihad militant in the area.
Military sources say the army is investigating.
The Israeli military, which regards Jenin as a hotbed of militants, surrounded the camp overnight.
They also went into the town of Bethlehem in pursuit of militants after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem on Thursday which left 11 Israelis dead.
Mr Hook was working in his office, in a small UN compound of mobile caravans in the northern part of the camp, when he was killed.
He was involved in a project to rebuild homes which were destroyed during previous Israeli operations.
According to Israeli military sources, an ambulance and medical crew were sent in when they heard about the incident, but Mr Hook was already dead.
A 12-year-old boy throwing stones was killed by Israeli fire in Jenin, eyewitnesses and hospital officials said.
In a separate incident, Caoimhe Butterly, a young Irishwoman active in a Palestinian solidarity group, told Irish radio she had been shot in the foot while trying to protect Palestinian children during the incursion.
The US struck after receiving specific tip-offs from within Zarqawi's organisation, officials said.
US President George W Bush described the news as a severe blow to al-Qaeda and "justice" for Zarqawi.
British PM Tony Blair described it as "very good news", but both leaders said Zarqawi's death would not end violence.
The news�came shortly before the Iraqi parliament approved the key posts of defence and interior ministers.
The two crucial roles had remained unfilled despite the formation of a coalition government last month.
Zarqawi's death was an opportunity for the new government to "turn the tide", President Bush said.
"The ideology of terror has lost one of its most visible and aggressive leaders," he added.
Correspondents say it remains to be seen if one man's death will bring a breakthrough in Iraq.
Zarqawi's "safe house" about 8km (five miles) north of Baquba was struck at 1815 (1415 GMT) on Wednesday, officials said.
The news sparked sustained applause.
The strike was the "painstaking, deliberate result" of intelligence over "many weeks", US military spokesman Major General William Caldwell said.
He showed a picture of the militant leader's body and a videotape of the attack, in which he said American F-16 fighter jets dropped the two 500lb bombs on the site.
The body was moved to a secure site where Zarqawi's identity was confirmed, the official said.
A Jordanian government spokesman said Jordanian agents had contributed to the operation against Zarqawi.
Mr Maliki said intelligence from Iraqi people had also helped to track down Zarqawi, who had a $25m (�13m) price on his head - the same bounty as that offered by the US for Osama Bin Laden.
A statement on the internet attributed to an umbrella group for jihadi organisations including al-Qaeda in Iraq has confirmed Zarqawi's death, reports say.
Within hours of the killings, troops launched 17 simultaneous raids around Baghdad, which yielded a "treasure trove" of intelligence, according to the US official.
Zarqawi was not a global mastermind like al-Qaeda leader Bin Laden, says the BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
Instead he was a bloodthirsty and violent thug, our correspondent says - who made enemies and several mistakes that might have contributed to his downfall.
These included ordering a triple suicide bombing against hotels in Amman, Jordan, last November, that killed 60 people, our correspondent says.
Zarqawi was accused of leading the rash of kidnappings and beheadings of foreign workers.
It has been suggested that he appeared personally on one video posted on the internet, cutting off the head of an American hostage.
Violence continued on Thursday as 13 people were killed and 28 injured in a bomb at a Baghdad market, while an evening car bombing killed five and injured at least 13, police said.
The badly-burned body of Dawn Walker, 37, from Fornham St Martin, Suffolk, was found next to the River Lark, near Bury St Edmunds, on 4 February 2005.
Her boyfriend, Kevin Nunn, 45, of Woolpit, Suffolk, had denied murdering Miss Walker.
The jury at Ipswich Crown Court found him guilty after 13 hours of deliberations and the judge ordered him to serve a minimum of 22 years in jail.
Miss Walker's body was discovered naked from the waist down and her body had been set alight with petrol, the court heard.
Prosecutor Graham Parkins QC said Nunn killed his girlfriend in a fit of jealousy after she had told him their relationship was over.
Mr Parkins said Miss Walker had been in a relationship with Nunn for more than two years.
Miss Walker had told friends that Nunn was "jealous" of other men, and after meeting a previous boyfriend, the relationship with Nunn had ended, Mr Parkins said.
The court heard that neighbours of Miss Walker heard the couple rowing on the evening of 2 February.
Mr Parkins told the jury that Miss Walker failed to turn up for work the next day.
The event, which draws enthusiasts from as far as the US, Japan and Canada, is being hosted at Floors Castle in Kelso.
About 7 million 2CV cars were produced between 1938 to 1990.
The first 2CV was designed by Jules Boulanger, joint managing director of Citroen with Pierre Michelin.
The brief was for a "Spartan form of transport for those of modest means".
However, with the start of World War II production was suspended and it was only in 1948 that the car was finally unveiled at the Paris Motor Show.
While motoring journalists described it as "the ugliest car in the world", the public took it to their hearts and by the 1960s sales had rocketed to almost 800 a day.
The car was eventually produced in more than 300 different versions and manufactured in 14 different countries.
Event organiser James Duffell said the appeal of the car was difficult to define.
"Also the fact that they are so simple to repair, if you really get into trouble you know you can get out of it.
The members' Bill has been raised by SNP MSP Bruce Crawford after ministers abolished tolls on the Erskine Bridge, near Glasgow.
They decided to keep tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges, which led to a campaign in Fife and Dundee.
The SNP said there had been enough consultation and has asked Holyrood managers to fast-track the Bill.
Coalition party MSPs in Fife and Dundee have expressed concerns that some tolls have remained in place.
The Scottish Executive said the latest phase of the bridge tolls review had looked at the management, operation and maintenance of Scotland's tolled bridges.
Ministers will now report on an examination of the economic, social and environmental impact and cost of retaining or removing tolls from the Tay and Forth bridges.
However Mr Crawford, who represents Mid-Scotland and Fife, said the Forth and Tay tolls must go as they were removed from the Erskine Bridges and before that, the Skye Bridge.
Mr Crawford now wants the member's Bill to be brought before MSPs to scrutinise as soon as possible.
Labour Dunfermline East MSP Helen Eadie has already sent a draft Bill proposal to Holyrood to scrap the tolls, which has been backed by Labour's three other Fife members at Holyrood and the party's Dundee West MSP Kate Maclean.

Hughes expects the job at Eastlands to be a huge challenge
Hughes was unveiled as City boss on Thursday after leaving Blackburn to become Sven-Goran Eriksson's successor.
"The ambition of the club is to challenge at the top table - not only in this country but in Europe," said ex-Manchester United striker Hughes.
Hughes said he left Blackburn in an attempt to achieve his ambitions of being at a club capable of challenging in the higher echelons, and he denied City were a route to a higher profile job for him.
"If I'm successful here I don't need any stepping stones," said the 44-year-old.
And City's new executive chairman Garry Cook has demonstrated the scale of the club's ambition under the new manager by saying they are interested in signing Ronaldinho from Barcelona.
"Ronaldinho is one of the greatest players that has ever played and we are committed to bringing the best players to this football club," said Cook.
"There is competition, we understand that, but it is well documented we havegone down a certain path and we are at a positive point.
And he also confirmed the club was poised to break its transfer record to sign another Brazilian, Jo, from CSKA Moscow for �20m.
"We had some targets prior to Mark being appointed manager because there was atiming issue but we did say to everyone we were holding off," said Cook.
Hughes had been linked with taking over as Chelsea boss but insists that was never an option after talks began with City.
"Once Manchester City made their intentions known I was very focused on getting the opportunity to come to the club," he said.
"From the time their intention was shown, I had the opportunity to speak to Garry and members of the board.
It was feared there would be an exodus of players from City following the exit of Eriksson and that is a situation Hughes said he would be addressing.
The former Wales boss warned his new players that he would be expecting them to show the necessary passion and drive to be a part of his plans.
"I'll back my ability against most managers in the Premier League and I think my management team is one of the best in the Premier League, and I think we can make an impact here," he said.
"If I didn't think that I wouldn't have come here.
"I'm very demanding (with players) on a day-to-day basis and I expect a certain level to be attained.
Hughes refused to be drawn on any transfer targets, but Shinawatra has made it clear he would like to sign Ronaldinho.
"Whatever the club in your heart, you would want to see this player in England, wouldn't you?", he told the Daily Mail.
"Ronaldinho wants the new challenge, the chance to play his best football again, to return to the days when he was really, really famous.
First Minister Jack McConnell was on hand as Glasgow announced the 17 sports that will be included in their bid.
Scotland won 10 judo medals at the 2002 Manchester event but it was dropped in 2006 and will not feature in 2010.
Archery, fencing and basketball are sports to miss out but table tennis, netball, triathlon and lawn bowls are among the 17 listed events.
Athletics, aquatics, boxing, badminton, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, rugby 7s, squash, shooting, weightlifting and wrestling make up all the disciplines.
"In those eleven days sport would transform a city, inspire a country and enthral millions of people.
"These Games will give Scots the chance to shine.
"From the athletes who will make the most of home soil advantage, to the thousands of volunteers who will look after the spectators at the venues, the Games will be something for our whole country to get behind.
Glasgow faces competition as the host city from Abuja, Nigeria and Halifax, Canada.
The winner will be selected in November in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Police say the gang seized the staff south of Peshawar late on Sunday, but were stopped at a security checkpoint.
PAEC set up an office in the area after high-grade uranium was discovered.
According to local sources, at least 20 armed men raided the PAEC office in the village of Banda Daud Shah in Karak district on Sunday night.
The kidnappers took the officials there hostage and set off with them towards the Orakzai agency in the nearby tribal areas.
According to the police, the kidnappers were from one of the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.
They said those involved had been identified, but refused to give further details.
It is the latest in a series of incidents targeting governmental and non-governmental organisations in the area.
In recent months, dozens of vehicles and more than 50 people have been hijacked or kidnapped by criminal gangs, BBC correspondents say.
Police blame most of the incidents on criminals, although they say tribesmen have also disguised themselves as Taleban fighters to carry out the raids.
In addition, some of the stolen vehicles have been used in bombings, the authorities say.
Most of the raiding tribesmen are said to come from the Taleban stronghold of North Waziristan.
Unicef looked at 40 indicators from the years 2000-2003 including poverty, family relationships, and health.
One of the report's authors told the BBC that under-investment and a "dog-eat-dog" society were to blame for Britain's poor performance.
The government says its policies have helped to improve child welfare.
In its league table the Netherlands came top, followed by Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
Unicef UK executive director David Bull said all the countries had weaknesses that needed to be addressed.
"By comparing the performance of countries we see what is possible with a commitment to supporting every child to fulfil his or her full potential," he said.
The authors say they used the most up-to-date information to assess "whether children feel loved, cherished, special and supported, within the family and community, and whether the family and community are being supported in this task by public policy and resources".
Professor Jonathan Bradshaw, from York University, one of the report's authors, put the UK's poor ratings down to long term under-investment and a "dog-eat-dog" society.
The UK government said its initiatives in areas such as poverty, pregnancy rates, teenage smoking, drinking and risky sexual behaviour had helped improve children's welfare.
Welfare reform minister Jim Murphy said the Unicef study was important, although it used some data which was now out of date.
"Hopefully it leads to a wider conversation about what more we can do to eradicate poverty," he said.
Unicef's league table drew on sources including the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the World Health Organization's survey of Health Behaviour in School-age Children (HBSC) aged 11, 13 and 15.
Colette Marshall, UK director of Save the Children, said it was "shameful" to see the UK at the bottom of the table.
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne accused Chancellor Gordon Brown of having "failed this generation of children".
"After 10 years of his welfare and education policies, our children today have the lowest well-being in the developed world," he said.
However, according to the official news agency, he has denied that any agreement already exists.
Mr Mahdi who was democratically elected prime minister in 1986 was overthrown three years later in a coup led by Mr Bashir.
President Bashir said Mr Mahdi's return "practically proved that the door is open to all opponents to come back home as there is no need for them to stay abroad and to carry arms".
On return from exile, Mr Mahdi urged people to work together to solve Sudan's problems peacefully.
He said he had come back to work with all parties for a return to democracy and an end to the 17-year civil war.
Mr Mahdi promised to reactivate his Umma party, which last year left an opposition alliance and began the process of reconciliation with the government.
That has already led to the return of dozens of Umma party activists and hundreds of former fighters.
A Syrian witness described Specialist Charles Graner as Abu Ghraib's "primary torturer", and said he was force-fed pork and alcohol, against Islamic law.
Another inmate, forced to masturbate in public, said US troops tortured Iraqis "like it was theatre for them".
Spc Graner, who denies all charges, faces up to 17 years in jail.
He is the first soldier to face court martial over the images of prisoner abuse at the Baghdad jail that caused worldwide outrage.
Spc Graner denies charges of assault and conspiracy to mistreat prisoners.
His court martial is being held at a military base in Fort Hood, Texas.
Hussein Mutar, an Iraqi sent to Abu Ghraib for stealing a car, was forced to masturbate in public and piled onto a pyramid of naked men.
Mr Mutar, who struggled throughout his video testimony, compared his jailers to the deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
"I couldn't believe in the beginning that this could happen, but I wished I could kill myself because no one was there to stop it.
Syrian fighter Amin al-Sheikh, in a video deposition recorded last month in Iraq, admitted going to the country in 2003 to fight US-led forces, and being involved in a shootout with guards at Abu Ghraib after being given a gun by an Iraqi guard.
After being injured in the gun fight, he said, he was taken back to his cell, where Spc Graner jumped on his wounded leg and hit his wounds with a metal baton.
He said the military policeman made him eat pork and drink alcohol, violating his religion, and made him insult the Islamic faith.
He said a Yemeni detainee had told him that Spc Graner made him "eat from the toilet".
The soldier's defence argues that the abuse was sanctioned by his superiors, and defence lawyer Guy Womack said Mr Sheikh's testimony helped Spc Graner.
The defence is due to begin its case on Wednesday, when Spc Graner is scheduled to testify.
Three guards from Spc Graner's 372nd Military Police Company have pleaded guilty to abuse charges.
Three others, including Private Lynndie England, who also features in photos from Abu Ghraib and with whom Spc Graner has since had a child, are awaiting trial.
In particular, Jackson - who was once accused and cleared of child abuse - told Bashir that he shared his bedroom with children.
In interviews with David Willis for BBC One's Breakfast programme, fans of Jackson said they did not know whether to find him dangerous or deluded.
"It was shocking, from the crazy Neverland Ranch to the child in the 44 year-old body," said one fan.
US TV is thought to have paid about �3m ($5m) for the documentary, which was first shown on ITV1 in the UK on Monday night to an estimated 14 million viewers.
The programme is made up of a broad series of interviews by Bashir, who spent eight months with the star.
But Jackson has been widely criticised since revealing on the programme that a 12-year-old boy regularly stayed at his mansion and slept in his bed.
American tabloid TV shows have given extensive coverage to the documentary.
Some US newspapers have defended Jackson and criticised Bashir for his treatment of the singer.
But prosecutors in California - the location of Jackson's 3,000 acres Neverland Ranch - said the superstar would not face a new probe into allegations of child abuse.
Santa Barbara County District Attorney Thomas Sneddon said that under the state's law sleeping with a child without "affirmative, offensive conduct" was not a criminal offence.
"Sleeping in bed with a kid is not a crime that I know of," Mr Sneddon told the Santa Barbara News-Press.
He added that police would require co-operation from a victim if any charges were to be brought.
Earlier, Gloria Allred, the lawyer, who represented a 13-year-old boy who claimed he had been abused by Jackson almost a decade ago, said she wanted the investigation reopened.
Jackson denied the charges, which were eventually suspended after a private settlement.
And a US child protection charity also called for the star to be investigated, saying state authorities should interview the children.
On Thursday, officials in Santa Barbara said they were taking Jackson's revelations seriously.
In a statement, local prosecutors said Jackson's revelations were "unusual" but not illegal and that it would take a complaint by a victim to prompt a criminal investigation.
The statement also said the sheriff's department would be reviewing the programme.
It also gave a hotline number for people to call if they believed they had evidence against the singer.
Meanwhile, Jackson has complained to television watchdogs in the UK about the documentary which he claims "utterly betrayed" him.
The singer's lawyers have written to the Independent Television Commission and theBroadcasting Standards Commission, saying he was "unfairly treated".
Jackson's legal team also claimed the programme was an infringement of his privacy.
The complaint to the ITC alleged the documentary "contains the clear innuendothat Mr Jackson is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children".
And in the letter to the BSC, Jackson said he was not warned Bashir's would interview him about an allegation of child molestation made in 1993, or link that to his current friendship with a 12-year-old boy.
Jackson also said the programme included film taken of his children "contrary to my express consent".
But Granada Television, which made the programme, has denied this.
The documentary, made for the UK's ITV1 network, has also been screened in the Netherlands and Australia.
Magomed Yevloyev was arrested and later shot after getting off the same flight as the local, Kremlin-backed leader.
Russian prosecutors say they have opened a criminal investigation into the case.
But opposition leaders say the killing is part of Russia's policy of "open genocide" towards the Ingush people.
Opposition leaders said such actions increased the backing for those seeking secession from Russia.
A posting on the site urged "all those who are not indifferent" to his killing to gather for a demonstration in the regional capital, Nazran.
The website owner was taken to hospital but died from his injuries.
Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the death.
"A preliminary investigation is being carried out into the incident as a result of which Yevloyev was killed," Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the investigations unit of the prosecutor general's office in Moscow told Reuters.
Mr Markin said police had tried to bring Mr Yevloyev in for questioning but that an incident occurred in which he received a gunshot wound that led to his death.
Mr Yevloyev was a thorn in the side of Ingush President Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general.
His website reported on alleged Russian security force brutality in Ingushetia, an impoverished province of some half a million people, mostly Muslims, which is now more turbulent than neighbouring Chechnya.
There is a low-level insurgency, with regular small-scale ambushes against police and soldiers.
In the latest incident in the region, on Monday, two policemen were killed and one was wounded in an ambush at a police station in the village of Achaluki, Interfax reports.
Genetic analysis of bison remains shows their populations started to crash around 37,000 years ago - long before humans arrived in the New World.
Researchers claim that climate change and other factors are more likely culprits in the extinction.
An international team has published its findings in Science magazine.
Until as recently as 20,000 years ago, North America had a range of large mammals to rival the wildlife of present-day Africa.
The continent was home to woolly mammoth and mastodon, horses, camels, giant ground sloths and bear-sized beavers, as well as sabre-tooths.
This so-called "megafaunal extinction" has been blamed by some on human hunters who appear in North America around 12,000 years ago.
Mitochondrial DNA comes from the cell's "power houses" and is inherited through the maternal line only.
Some of the best-preserved material used in the study was unearthed from beneath the Alaskan permafrost by gold miners, some of whom even kept the remains refrigerated until the scientists came to claim them.
Scientists stand a much better chance of extracting useful DNA sequences from such frozen remains.
From this ancient genetic material, Alan Cooper at the University of Oxford, UK, and colleagues were able to reconstruct a genetic history of bison over a period of around 150,000 years.
Using mathematical analysis, the researchers were able to extract information about bison population size through time.
During the late Pleistocene and Holocene Epochs, bison roamed across a territory called Beringia, an ice-free refuge that stretched from eastern Siberia to the north-west of Canada.
"Some component of these ecological changes may have been sufficient to stress bison populations across Beringia," the researchers write in their research paper.
He points out that, in other areas, bison have managed to shrug off dramatic shifts in climate.
The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is a 15-digit code which appears on the operator's network whenever a call is made.
The absence of this number makes it impossible to trace either the caller or the phone or to access call details.
Indian intelligence agencies say phones without the code have been used in attacks by militant groups.
Mobile phones without the code were blocked at midnight - operators were asked to bar calls to them "in the wake of increased threat perception from militants".
It is estimated that India has more than 25 million phones without codes.
Phones with no codes or invalid numbers are mostly cheap, unbranded phones.
Millions are manufactured in India or imported, mostly from China.
Correspondents say these phones are popular because they are usually much cheaper than the branded ones.
Many phone subscribers said they were being wrongly penalised because they were not aware that every handset had to have a code.
The Cellular Operators' Association of India has asked the government to extend the deadline for blocking the numbers so that it can install identity numbers on unbranded devices.
According to estimates by the Indian Cellular Association, unbranded phones account for nearly 30% of all sales in India.
India has the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world, with more than 488 million subscribers.
Every month millions of new subscribers are added to the list.
The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) campaign features a poster of the hands and feet of a boy who had a leg blown off.
The poster is one of hundreds going on display across the country.
The Welsh-born player unveiled one of the posters close to Manchester United's Old Trafford ground.
A Unicef spokesman said every day 26 children tread on landmines in wartorn areas across the world.
The billboard poster is of the prints of Candilo, a nine-year-old Angolan child, who last year had his leg blown off by a landmine.
The youngster was trying to keep up with his older brother as they raced home and he trod on a mine.
Unicef works in several ways to prevent children getting injured or killed by stepping on the weapons.
It runs education programmes for children andcommunities on how to avoid landmines as well as providing physiotherapy and prosthetic limbs to those who have survived accidents.
The General Register Office for Scotland said there were 12,770 deaths in the second quarter of 2009.
The figures also revealed a slight fall in the number of marriages and births, compared with the same period in 2008.
"Death rates fluctuate and we shouldn't make too much of a single quarter.
Other comparisons with the second quarter of 2008 showed that marriages were down by 32 from 7,904 to 7,872.
A total of 145 civil partnerships were registered in the quarter, 31 more than those held in the second quarter of 2008.

The US sprint star has been shunned by many of the top meetings in Europe this season because of her links with the Balco doping scandal.
"It's ridiculous an athlete who has not been charged or done anything wrong can be the target of a boycott," she said.
She said she was an "eligible athlete" so should have the same chances to compete as any other.
The three-time Olympic gold medallist has also revealed her plans to focus solely on regaining her form on the track and put the long jump on the backburner.
"I want to get back to being dominant in them (the sprint events) and once I do that I'll pick up the long jump again," she said.
Jones also said she hoped to continue running up to the Beijing Olympics, where - ideally - she would like to bow out.
"I've set a goal date of 2008," Jones said on Friday.
Jones also said she would be open to playing basketball when she retires from athletics.
Among the options that could be open to Jones are playing for her hometown club LA Sparks, or Phoenix - who hold the rights to Jones in the Women's NBA.
Asamoah Gyan got the only goal of the game in Luanda with 16 minutes played.
The Rennes forward pounced on a fine ball from Kwadwo Asamoah and slotted in calmly from the right-hand side of the penalty area for the Black Stars.
Angola were left to rue several missed opportunities, with Palancas Negras striker Manucho wasting a number of good chances to score.
But a young Ghana side, shorn of many of its established stars, will be proud of holding out against the hosts, even if they were grateful to Manucho's profligacy as they set up a last-four clash with Zambia or Nigeria.
They will, however, face a worry over the fitness of match-winner Gyan, after the striker had to be substituted midway through the second half clutching the back of his right thigh.
Angola misfortune in front of goal was on show as early as the 29th minute when Manucho's header from a Flavio cross looked goal-bound, only for Ghana keeper Richard Kingson to make a fantastic save.
The Palancas Negras were then awarded an indirect free kick deep inside the penalty area when keeper Kingson held on to the ball for too long, but Manucho could only shoot high over the bar.
And the Real Valladolid striker endured another woeful miss just eight minutes later.
This time, after Kingson had saved Flavio's attempt on goal, Manucho blasted over the bar with the goal gaping and the keeper stranded on the floor.
Manucho continued the trend in the second half, heading high over the bar from a Job cross in the 72nd minute.
Finally, in injury time, Kali looked certain to score when Kingson dashed out of his goal and tripped over, but Isaac Vorsah cleared to maintain Ghana's advantage.
The Black Stars struggled to get through the Angola back line in their quest for a second goal.
Palancas Negras goalkeeper Carlos Fernandes saved a long-range shot from Kwadwo Asamoah late in the game.
The Black Stars were put under intense by the hosts late on and had to endure nearly six minutes of added injury time, but they held on to secure their progress.
Tamas Priskin put Ipswich ahead with a close-range shot but the striker missed the chance to extend the lead when his penalty was saved by Lewis.
Lee Frecklington pulled Posh back into it with a shot into the top right corner from the outside of the area.
The match was settled in the second-half when George Boyd popped up to score from the edge of the area.
"We had a good start scoring early and then had an opportunity with a penalty.
"We didn't take it which sums up our season so far, not taking advantage at vital stages of the game.

Winter Olympics guide - Skeleton bobsleigh
The event has reaped dividends for Team GB with Amy Williams winning gold at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Canada.
The skeleton is all about a big push at the start and tactical steering after that as the slider is taken on a bone-jangling journey down the icy course.
Once on the course, the athlete steers the skeleton by gently transferring weight to the left or right.
It is important to take as direct a line as possible, avoid contact with the walls and reduce wind resistance by keeping elbows in and shoulders in contact with the sled.
After the finish, the feet are dragged along the ice to bring the skeleton to a standstill.
The Olympic competition consists of two runs, both held on the same day.
The start order for the first run is based on a random draw the day before competition, and only the top 20 men and top 12 women after the first qualify for the second run.
For the final run, the slider with the best time goes last, and the one with the best combined time from the two runs wins.
An Aled Gravelle try gave the visitors the advantage, but Dan Parks' 12 points edged the home team ahead at Firhill.
A Jon Petrie try took them clear and as the Scarlets fought back Wales number eight Alix Popham was sent off for disputing a poor refereeing decision.
Consolation for the visitors came with a bonus point that guarantees them Heineken Cup rugby next season.
They cannot now be overtaken by the Dragons, who will face a play-off with the third-best Italian team for the final European slot if they fail to overhaul the Ospreys.
The visitors took the early advantage in the game with a Craig Evans penalty, but lost the initiative when Popham was sin-binned for a high and dangerous tackle on Fergus Thomson.
Parks landed the resultant penalty, and added a second with Popham still cooling his heels.
The Glasgow fly-half missed with two other chances in a dire first half, though, leaving it at 6-3 at the break.
The Scarlets made a more promising start to the second period, replacement Paul Mackey impressing.
With the line at the Welsh side's mercy, Glasgow centre Andrew Henderson came in from an offside position and was punished with a yellow card.
The visitors went for the jugular with a series of scrums, before eventually releasing to the backs.
Recycled ball was sent wide by Dwayne Peel, hooker Gravelle receiving in midfield and showing the nous to throw a dummy past Colin Gregor for the opening try.
Sloppy forward work from the Scarlets gave Parks a further two penalties, though, as the home side regained the lead.
The Llanelli team then blew the restart, giving Glasgow the platform for a swift attack up the centre of the field.
Their forwards recycled quickly and fed Parks, who put flanker Petrie clear in the corner.
Regan King and Dafydd Jones combined to spark a fine Scarlets attack, ended when a sniping Peel was held up over the try line.
From the scrum five Popham appeared to control the ball perfectly at his feet, but referee George Clancy ruled that it had come out, allowing Glasgow to steal possession.
Popham reacted with an angry gesture and comment aimed at Clancy, leading to a sending off for a second yellow-card offence, a decision that could affect his hopes of touring with Wales to Argentina next month.
The under-strength Scarlets bravely came back at Glasgow, but the Scots had enough to hold on and end a six-game Celtic League losing streak.
Borders' loss at Ulster means that Scotland's second and final Heineken Cup qualifiers will be decided on a tense final weekend of action.
"Our appetite has always been there - we've come close without finishing things off so it was nice to close it out tonight.
The show - which returned to the screens after a 13-year absence - will air until September.
A decision will have to be taken in the spring or early summer as to whether it will continue.
The daytime soap was originally commissioned by ITV for one year and will celebrate its first anniversary in March.
ITV has already recommissioned Crossroads from Carlton for shows up until September.
It first went out five times a week but this was then cut to four to cut down on expenditure.
The same also happened to the original soap, before it was eventually shelved in 1988.
In its heyday Crossroads attracted an audience of 18 million viewers but was both maligned and revered by fans and critics alike for its wooden acting and wobbly sets.
Once a shabby motel, Crossroads was upgraded to a four star hotel complete with executive suites and a health spa.
But the newest daytime soap Night and Day is struggling to attract viewers despite being billed as a totally new style of soap.
Of the 108 breast screening units in Britain, 78 took part in the survey and the college says the findings are worrying, particularly since screening for cancer is so high on the government's agenda for health care.
Funding shortages and staffing problems are placing radiologists under extreme pressure.
At present, women between 50 and 64 are screened every three years, but radiologists are under additional pressure because more and more women are using the service.
The survey says delays in screening are now commonplace and medical experts believe this could pose a significant risk to women's health.
Ayatollah Muhammad Baqr al-Hakim died in a massive car bomb blast in the Shia holy city of Najaf last Friday, along with at least 80 other people.
Ahead of his burial in Najaf on Tuesday, Shia ceremonies have been continuing to bid farewell to the revered late ayatollah, who had a long history of fighting the former Iraqi regime.
Meanwhile, after weeks of wrangling the US-appointed governing council named a cabinet, where Shias will control 13 of the 25 posts.
The cabinet members, who are to act as government ministers in an interim administration until elections are held, represent Iraq's various sectarian communities, but include only one woman.
"Many of you might have heard the hissing of snakes, the servants of the infidel occupation invaders, who - after the killing of al-Hakim - rushed to accuse, without any evidence, those they called the supporters of Saddam Hussein of the incident," the tape said.
US audio analysts have yet to say if the voice on the tape really is that of Saddam Hussein, but the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner says experts already saying they believe it is genuine.
He says that by denying the responsibility for the bombing, Saddam Hussein - if it is him - has wasted little time in distancing himself from the atrocity.
But among the tens of thousands of Shias who have been joining the funeral procession behind the coffin of the murdered ayatollah, there is little doubt that loyalists of Saddam Hussein were responsible, says the BBC's Valerie Jones.
Ayatollah Hakim - the leader of the Iranian-backed Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) - had returned to Iraq after more than two decades in exile, and cautiously supported co-operation with the US occupying forces.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been called in to help investigate the Najaf attack, which happened just after the late cleric had delivered a sermon for Friday prayers.
The FBI's top agent in Iraq, Thomas Fuentes, said experts would look for links between the Najaf bombing and attacks on the UN headquarters and Jordanian embassy in Baghdad last month.
Mr Fuentes told the French news agency that their work would not, however, start until after Tuesday's burial.
The huge funeral procession for the dead cleric - whose coffin is being taken to holy shrines before burial, as Shia tradition demands - passed through the holy city of Karbala on Monday.
Shia tradition also demands that a senior cleric performs the final burial for another leading cleric, but that given the widespread concern about the lack of security in Najaf, it is not clear whether any of the four prominent Shia authorities in the city will be present for the burial, says the BBC's Sadeq Saba.
Monday's announcement of the ministerial cabinet - which took weeks to agree because a wide range of political, religious and ethnic groups had to be accommodated - is seen as a significant step forward in setting up a new government.
The finance ministry goes to a Sunni, Kamel al-Kailani, while a Shia, Ibrahim Muhammad Bahr al-Ulloum, is named finance minister.
The foreign affairs ministry will be headed by a Kurd, Hoshiar al-Zibari, while the only woman in the cabinet, Nisreen Mustafa al-Burwari (also a Kurd) is public works minister.
BBC Middle East analyst Roger Hardy says the naming of a cabinet is largely a symbolic act, and the new ministers will have to convince a sceptical Iraqi public that they constitute an independent body and not a tool of the Americans.
On the evening of 26 November 2008, gunmen attacked several locations across the Indian city of Mumbai.
Over the next four days, more than 170 people died as security forces laid siege to hotels and other buildings where the gunmen had holed up with their hostages.
One of the highest profile locations to be targeted was the Jewish Outreach Centre at Nariman House.
A year after the tragedy, Sanjoy Majumder visited the centre to see the lasting effects of the attack.
Campaigners said the planned eco-town south of Leicester near Great Glen would ruin the mostly rural area.
The idea is part of a government programme to create 10 carbon neutral settlements across the country.
The petition, on the 10 Downing Street website, has seen a surge of support as the date for a decision gets closer, campaigners have said.
One of the campaigners, Councillor Kevin Feltham, said they would be holding a public meeting next month.
The Co-op, which owns much of the land concerned, said the plans would be submitted to the government and, if short-listed, there would be a full public consultation.
More than 50 proposals have been sent to the government and a decision is expected in February.
Some claim racism is replacing sectarianism in the province's post-Troubles society, with loyalist paramilitaries blamed for an upsurge of attacks in Belfast.
But there has been a long history of links between extreme right-wing groups based in England and loyalists in Northern Ireland, particularly the largest organisation, the Ulster Defence Association.
But 212 incidents took place in just nine months between April and December last year.
Police patrols have been stepped up in south Belfast where Chinese and Pakistani families, including pregnant women, have borne the brunt of recent attacks.
However, Filipino nurses have also been targeted in Belfast and County Antrim and Muslim families have fled after attacks in County Armagh, where plans for the province's first mosque have been put on hold.
The police will not say who they think are behind racist attacks but stress that the community must help combat such activity.
"Incidents of a racial nature are a priority," said Inspector Robin Dempsey.
David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party, which is linked to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, has denied that terror group was behind racist attacks.
However, Davy Carlin of the Anti-Racism Network, which was set up five months ago to try to end the attacks, said loyalist elements were to blame.
"Whether or not these attacks are sanctioned by the UDA or UVF is not the issue, although the leaderships are turning a blind eye at the very least," he said.
He said right-wing groups such as the British National Party and Combat 18 were distributing leaflets in loyalist areas of Belfast, "trying to infiltrate the UDA", whilst the White Nationalist Group was targeting the Craigavon area of County Armagh.
"They go into loyalist working class areas where they are socially and economically deprived and blame the social problems on immigrants and minority ethnic groups," he said.
Its leader, Nick Griffin, visited the loyalist heartland of east Belfast last month to outline its plans to expand in the province "as part of a campaign to try to halt a mass influx of immigrants".
There has been no indication that attacks have taken place in republican areas.
Last week, leading Sinn Fein spokesman Alex Maskey warned that someone would be killed if the intimidation did not stop.
Three years ago, one of the most comprehensive studies into racial prejudice in the province indicated racism was twice as common as sectarianism.
The University of Ulster interviewed 1,250 people and found "significant levels" of racism and anti-traveller prejudice.
Two-thirds said they would not work with members of the travelling community, more than half would not accept travellers as neighbours and more than a third said they would not like to work with Asian, Afro-Caribbean or Chinese people.
A BBC investigation last October found that ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland were more than twice as likely to face a racist incident than those in England or Wales.
Proposals for draft legislation on sectarianism and racism, which could mean tougher sentences for people convicted of so-called hate crimes, are to be announced soon.
But the health union, Unison, has called for such laws to be fast-tracked in the wake of alleged attacks on Filipino nurses in south Belfast.
A meeting is planned later this week to discuss the situation, days after a young nurse claimed she was chased by youths who hurled racial abuse at her.
Chief executive of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) Seamus McAleavey said there was evidence that many attacks were planned and co-ordinated.
Patrick Yu of the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities said the recent spate of attacks could be the tip of the iceberg.
"A lot of cases are not reported to the police for one reason or another, in particular they are more vulnerable to reprisal if they report them to the police," he said.
In response to the attacks, the Anti-Racism Network, which includes representatives of 25 organisations from cultures as diverse as African, Chinese and Muslim, is organising a rally on 27 January at Belfast City Hall.
It is hoped that the Loyalist Commission - set up to provide political analysis for loyalist paramilitary groups and includes unionist and loyalist politicians and Protestant clergymen - can be persuaded to help stop the attacks.
The Presbyterian Church's spokesman on Race Relations said it would be a mistake to regard the perpetrators of such attacks as "mindless thugs".
The Equality Commission has urged people to face up to the threat posed by racial prejudice and the "malevolent minority" who are engaged in racial crime.
However, contrary to what the statistics would suggest, attitudes towards ethnic communities are not all negative.
Perhaps this is typified by a newspaper in Dungannon which has begun a regular column in Portuguese and English to help the 1,500 Portuguese people who live and work in the area.
Ian Greer, editor of the Tyrone Courier, said he wanted to help the migrant community feel involved in the life of the town.
"The Portuguese are now a sizeable group that has come along in the past four to five years and is an important part of life in Dungannon," he said.
In a speech to the Scottish Labour conference in Perth, the prime minister promised an "invest and reform" programme for public services.
He cited work with the private sector as an example of this reform and said Labour "could not afford to wait" in key areas like the NHS.
Three themes emerged during Mr Blair's speech at the Dewar's Centre - Labour's "social democratic vision", public services and "the world stage".
He said the old consensus over the NHS had been replaced by a debate over whether to guarantee free universal care or develop a "US-style pay as you go".
"I'm in no doubt that the basic principle is as right for today as it was for the 1940s," he said.
He also spent a considerable part of the speech underlining the importance of the global effort to stamp out terrorism.
Describing "the world stage" as the third challenge facing his government and party, Mr Blair accused political opponents of wanting to "retreat into isolationism".
He said that trying to bring peace to the Middle East was of utmost importance and said this would remain a priority.
Elsewhere, he thanked the party faithful for their help in securing an historic second terms for the party and paid tribute to the "great dignity" of Scotland's former First Minister Henry McLeish.
He also backed Jack McConnell as a "fine successor" who had already shown that "he has what it takes to be an outstanding first minister".
The Chief Inspector of Prisons said the workshops were an outstanding resource and it was a "shameful waste" they were not being used.
The Scottish Prison Service has blamed the situation on the increased numbers held in Edinburgh.
A spokesman agreed it was unacceptable, but said the SPS was working hard to improve the position.
The report, which follows the final inspection by Dr Andrew McLellan before he demits office, is largely positive.
Dr McLellan said the facilities were first-class, and expressed the hope the forthcoming months would see the promise offered by the new buildings being fulfilled.
But he said he was disappointed that workshops were often empty when the inspectors visited.
Dr McLellan points out that prisoners who could be using the workshops were instead locked for long periods in their cells.
At the time of the inspection, the numbers in the jail were below capacity - 795 prisoners, but late last year it had held as many as 913.
The Scottish Prison Service said the heightened prisoner population meant staff were fully occupied simply managing the numbers and the "churn" of new admissions.
Talking to Radio 5 live's Mark Pougatch, England's James Anderson says he feels "surprisingly fresh" after returning home in between Tests for the birth of his daughter and is looking forward to bowling on the Perth pitch in the third Test on Thursday.
Josh Lewsey explains the decision behind his retirement from England rugby duty to concentrate on his club career at Wasps, and his hope to play on the 2009 Lions Tour.
In return she must drop her support for international sanctions and abandon her confrontational attitude, it said.
It is the first time during his 15-year rule that Gen Shwe has indicated he may be ready for dialogue with Suu Kyi.
State media also say 2,093 people were arrested during the recent crackdown on anti-government protests.
It said 692 people had already been released after signing a declaration that they would not take part in any future rallies.
However, BBC sources in Burma say as many as 10,000 people - many of them monks who led the demos - have been rounded up for interrogation in recent days.
Security forces are said to be using video recordings of the demonstrations to compile lists of activists for arrest.
In Washington, the state department confirmed that its most senior envoy in Burma, Shari Villarosa, has been invited to meet the military government on Friday.
The announcement came hours before the UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari was to brief UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon following his recent trip to Burma.
He is to brief the UN Security Council later on Friday.
Gen Shwe apparently made the offer to meet Ms Suu Kyi during talks with Mr Gambari on Tuesday.
Mr Gambari was allowed to meet her twice, both before and after seeing the generals, which, correspondents say, suggests he may have been carrying messages between the two sides.
Previous attempts to build dialogue between the military and Aung San Suu Kyi - who is still the pre-eminent symbol of Burma's democratic movement - have come to nothing.
Gen Shwe has been steadfast in his hostility to Aung San Suu Kyi - it is said he will not even tolerate her name being mentioned in his presence, says BBC regional correspondent Chris Hogg.
Dozens are feared to have died during the suppression of the protests, which were sparked after the government raised fuel prices.
Residents of the main city, Rangoon, say the streets are now quiet during daylight hours, with the police and army keeping a low profile.
But during the overnight curfew, they say raids by the security forces continue.
Earlier on Thursday, the body of Japanese reporter Kenji Nagai killed during the demonstrations in Rangoon arrived home.
Japanese officials say he was shot at close range, contradicting earlier claims by the Burmese authorities that he was hit accidentally by a stray bullet.
The Burmese regime - which has held power since 1962 - has been condemned for its actions across the world.
Multi-party elections were held in 1990 and were won comprehensively by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party.
But the ruling junta - known for its corruption and mismanagement - dismissed the results and continued to exercise a stranglehold on power.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) also raised concerns over the slowing economy when it released a survey showing a continuing slide in business optimism.
The bleak prognosis came after announcements of thousands of possible job losses at ship builder Cammell Laird and Marconi and as doubts remain over the future of 3,200 jobs at Motorola's mobile phone factory in Bathgate, West Lothian.
He went on to say it was too soon to talk of recession.
In its report, the IoD said economic activity peaked in the first quarter of 2000, and has been decelerating over the last four quarters.
Their index of business optimism - the balance of business leaders who were more optimistic, rather than less - fell to 28% in the first quarter of this year from 35% in the final quarter of last year.
"In addition to the deteriorating international environment, falling equity prices and the cumulative knock-on effects of the foot and mouth epidemic are increasingly damaging economic confidence and activity," said Ruth Lea, head of the policy unit at the IoD.
She warned there was a very real chance of a serious economic downturn.
But latest figures from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) show that despite the global slowdown, confidence in manufacturing has risen to its highest level for a year.
In a survey of more than 7,000 UK firms, it showed that although manufacturers have been reporting slower growth in domestic sales this year, more were optimistic about improving turnover over the next 12 months.
"Underlying strength in the domestic economy remains," said David Sears, deputy director general at the BCC.
"Manufacturers [are] confident of avoiding the worst of the impact of the global slowdown," he added.
Hopes that the European Central Bank would add its weight to kick-starting the flagging global economy received a setback on Wednesday when it left interest rates on hold in the euro-zone.
Pretty much every exhibit in the vast Cobo Center contains prominently-displayed cars powered by alternative fuel such as ethanol made from plants, or by engines powered by conventional fuels such as petrol and diesel that are up to 25% more efficient than they were in the past.
Most carmakers also display hybrid models, where such conventional engines are coupled with electric batteries that are getting smaller and lighter by the day, thus increasing the possible range travelled by electric cars.
"This auto show may be different from the past," observes David Friedman, research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists' Clean Vehicle Program.
Auto makers are under pressure to produce more efficient cars that use less fuel and thus pollute less, in part because petrol prices have soared in recent years in the US, but also because they will soon be required to do so by law.
In December, US President George W Bush signed an energy bill that will force the industry to cut average emissions from all vehicles.
By 2020, the average must have been slashed by 40% to 35 miles per gallon, and the industry is convinced they will be able to deliver - though it will not come cheaply.
"It's going to come at some cost," says Paul Traub, economy and industry analyst, Chrysler, estimating that the auto makers' efforts to comply with environmental regulation could add as much as $7,000 (�3,400) to the price of trucks and cars.
But although polluting emissions are set to come down in the future, the industry is not about to ask drivers in America to make major sacrifices.
"Most of the impact is not going to be on total volumes or total spending, but on consumer choices," predicts Ted Chu, an economist at General Motors.
The industry will respond by "offering more creative packages", hence there should be a shift away from large trucks and cars towards smaller vehicles, he predicts.
On the show floor, there is little evidence of such a shift.
Big and powerful vehicles dominate, and although many of them are plastered with "hybrid" stickers it will be a long while before such models become widely available.
"The astonishing part is that so much new technology and so many new vehicles are being introduced at the show," says Global Insight auto analyst Aaron Bragman.
But, he adds, "announcing the arrival of a technology does not mean it is ready for sale to consumers".
The fact that many of the so-called greener models on display will take years to reach showrooms in America
"It's not good enough and it's not soon enough," says Cristin Lindsay of the Automotive X-prize competition, which is offering a $10m prize to encourage the creation of a commercially viable car that can do 100 miles per gallon.
Collins was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959 and began his career in 1976 with school punk band the Nu-Sonics.
Three years later, the band had evolved into Orange Juice, one of the central faces of the Glasgow neo-pop scene which enjoyed a loyal cult fan base.
The band signed to Polydor in 1981 and released four albums but, with the success of Rip It Up aside, their commercial prowess failed to live up to their dutiful following.
After several changes in line-up and a self-titled release in 1984 which failed to chart, Orange Juice disbanded.
Collins went on to work as a solo artist but didn't release his first album until 1989, after initially failing to win a contract.
His debut album was entitled Hope and Despair and featured Orange Juice drummer Zeke Manyika and Aztec Camera's Roddy Frame.
Hellbent on Compromise came next in 1990 followed by his third and most successful album Gorgeous George in 1994, which was home to the hit A Girl Like You.
The multi-million selling global single would come to define the singer, establishing him as a household name and entering the top 10 in seven countries including the UK, France and Australia.
In the same year that he released Gorgeous George, Collins set up his own studio which allowed him to pursue his own sound production ideas and work with other artists.
He has produced work by long-running friend Paul Quinn, the Rockingbirds, A House and Frank and Walters.
He made a fleeting return to the pop charts in 1997 with The Magic Piper (Of Love) from the soundtrack to hit movie Austin Powers.
The album I'm Not Following You was released on independent label Setanta in 1997 and would not be followed up until 2002 with his fifth solo album Doctor Syntax.
Veering away from music briefly in 1999, Collins created Channel 4 sitcom West Heath Yard and feature-length sequel West Heath House in 2000.
He produced The Proclaimers' 2003 album Born Innocent and his current projects include the debut album from London blues three-piece Little Barrie.
It is believed to be the first time that such a procedure has been used to treat cancer.
The procedure was used by doctors in Italy to treat a 48-year-old man with multiple tumours in his liver.
New Scientist magazine reports that one year after surgery, the liver is functionally normally and latest scans show no sign of tumours.
The team, surgeons from San Matteo Hospital in Pavia and physicists from the local division of the National Institute ofNuclear Physics, plans to treat six further patients using the same technique.
It is hoped that eventually it will be used to treat hard-to-treat cancers in other organs that can be transplanted, such as the lungs or pancreas.
The patient they have treated had had a colon tumour removed, but the cancer spread to his liver.
Scans revealed no fewer than 14 tumours there, and many smaller ones were discovered during the operation.
Such diffuse cancers are very difficult to treat by conventional means.
This usually involves focusing X-ray beams onto the target - without destroying the liver.
So doctors decided to try a method called boron neutron capture therapy.
This involves injecting boron atoms into the cancerous organ, and using a neutron beam to split them into destructive high-energy particles.
But to ensure that all cancerous cells are destroyed, an even dose of neutrons has to be given to the entire organ.
This is not easy to do in the body, where obstructions suchas bones block the neutron beam.
And the tissues surrounding the organ inevitably receive a large dose of radiation.
To overcome the problem, surgeons removed the entire liver.
The organ was placed in a Teflon bag that neutrons can pass through and taken to a research reactor nearby, where it was irradiated with neutrons.
It was then re-implanted, just as in a normal liver transplant operation.
Nigel Hughes, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, told BBC News Online that the technique sounded very promising.
However, Mr Hughes warned that there were not enough specialists in the UK to offer all liver cancer patients access to current surgical procedures, which involve cutting out cancerous sections of the organ.
A coalition spokesman told a news conference in Baghdad that the warrant had been issued in connection with the murder of a rival cleric last year.
The statement came on the second day of violent anti-coalition protests across Iraq by Mr Sadr's supporters.
US helicopter gunships targeted militia members loyal to Mr Sadr in the mainly Shia district of al-Shuala in Baghdad.
Coalition officials told a news conference in Baghdad that the warrant for Mr Sadr's arrest had been drawn up by an Iraqi judge and would be executed "without advance warning".
Mr Sadr has denied any involvement in the killing of Abdel-Majid al-Khoei in Najaf in April last year.
The Shia protests were triggered by the closure of Mr Sadr's al-Hawza newspaper a week ago on the grounds that it was inciting violence.
They intensified after the arrest on Saturday of one of Mr Sadr's top aides, Mustafa Yacoubi, in connection with Mr Khoei's murder.
The coalition accuses Mr Sadr of trying to usurp its power and says the revolt will not be tolerated.
Many of Iraq's majority Shia Muslims, repressed under Saddam Hussein, welcomed last year's US-led invasion, and attacks on coalition forces were largely confined to the minority Sunni community before Sunday's violence.
However, Mr Sadr has become an increasingly outspoken opponent of the occupation.
The US administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, said on Monday that Mr Sadr's followers had effectively placed themselves outside the law.
But Mr Sadr responded by saying he was "proud" to be considered an outlaw by the US.
The latest upsurge in violence has fuelled speculation that the handover might be delayed.
But in Washington, President George W Bush said the US was committed to handing over sovereignty to Iraqis on 30 June.
Apache gunships targeted militiamen of Mr Sadr's Mehdi Army on the streets of the capital's mainly Shia district of al-Shuala as a battle raged on the ground, correspondents report.
One US vehicle was reported to be in flames, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
At least nine coalition soldiers and 46 Iraqis have been killed in confrontations related to the protests.
Local resident Abbas Amid told the AFP news agency that fighting had flared after a US troop convoy tried to enter Shuala and came under heavy fire.
There was also tension in Sadr City, a district which saw eight US troops and a reported 22 Iraqis killed in Sunday's fighting.
American tanks were blocking approaches to the area and soldiers were carrying out vehicle searches as angry protesters gathered again.
US troops also began an offensive in Falluja, a Sunni town where four Americans were killed and mutilated.
In the southern city of Basra, about 150 Mehdi Army members occupied the governor's office at dawn on Monday as part of the protests, but in the evening they ended their action.
At one stage British forces moved towards the governor's office and gunfire was heard, but the soldiers then withdrew.
Paul Bremer accused Mr Sadr of seeking to "establish his authority in the place of the legitimate authority".
"We have a group under Moqtada al-Sadr that has basically placed itself outside the legal authorities, the coalition and Iraqi officials," he said in Baghdad.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's leading Shia cleric, appealed for calm and negotiations on Sunday, as a call to "terrorise the enemy" circulated among Moqtada al-Sadr's followers.
The Tesco supermarket chain has claimed it is the first retailer in the world to put Pentium III computers on the shelves on Friday.
The PCs, with 128Mb of RAM, 10Gb hard drives, 56k modems and 17" displays were priced at a competitive �1,180 including VAT.
"We want our customers to get the best machines at the best prices," said Commercial Director John Gildersleeve.
A privacy group in the United States was planning to put a damper on Intel's biggest launch of the year by filing a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission later on Friday.
The Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) says the unique Processor Serial Number (PSN) on each chip will allow users to be tracked over the Internet and its inclusion amounts to "unfair and deceptive practices".
"Although there are constructive ways to use the processor ID feature to validate user identification, there are also legitimate privacy concerns raised by the potential misuse of this feature," said IBM in the letter.
A coalition of privacy groups has already urged a boycott of the chip and sent a letter to the FTC calling for an investigation.
The PIII has 70 new instructions on the chip which will boost multimedia performance, in particular 3-D, full-motion video and voice processing.
Intel demonstrated the gigahertz chip, capable of one billion instructions a second, this week, but had to specially cool it to achieve the mark.
The Orkney MSP will also leave the Scottish Parliament at the next election in 2007.
He said it was time to hand on the leadership to fresh blood, following the Lib Dems' success in last week's general election.
Mr Spellar said the troops were being trained in a bid to thwart any repeat of the chaos brought by fuel blockades in September that led to massive petrol and diesel shortages.
Mr Spellar's comments came during defence questions in the Commons on Monday.
Defending the potential use of troops, he said that it was "absolutely right to make contingency plans" in order "to maintain the supply of essential services to the nation".
Replying to that point, Mr Spellar mocked the Tories, saying that he was "interested" to hear a Conservative MP opposing moves to "safeguard and secure vital supplies to maintain the country".
Shadow defence secretary Iain Duncan Smith demanded to know who would sanction any deployment of the armed forces to "bust any sort of strike".
But Mr Spellar said he was unaware of any proposal to mount a strike over fuel supplies.
He said he was aware, however, of "threats to blockade, disrupt, barricade" and to conduct potentially illegal action.
He added that troops would be under the command of the armed forces.
"What I find quite extraordinary is that there is no comment from the Conservatives that in anyway deplores proposals to disrupt national supplies," Mr Spellar said.
He then accused the Tories of supporting people on the barricades at refineries rather than "defending law and order".
After the September fuel protests the government was criticised for its failure to foresee the anger felt by many hauliers and farmers over fuel tax.
The wave of protests that all but brought Britain to a standstill largely caught the government off-guard.
Mr Spellar's announcement of the government's preparations to utilise the military ahead of the expiry of the 60-day deadline is likely to be seen by fuel lobby groups as an attempt to stifle their right to protest.
But the government will not want to allow itself to be held to ransom by another round of blockades.

The Northern Irishman, who made his Ryder Cup debut in 2008, shot a superb final-round 63 to card 15 under par and beat Wales' Rhys Davies by three shots.
Davies fired a stunning course record of 62 but McDowell showed composure and class to win his fifth tournament.
England's Luke Donald finished two shots further back on 10 under.
Scot Stephen Gallacher bogeyed the final two holes to spoil his round, finishing in a three-way tie for fourth with Robert Rock of England and Italy's Edoardo Molinari.
The £300,000 first prize is McDowell's first victory since his 2008 triumph at the Scottish Open and takes him to the verge of the qualification places to make Colin Montgomerie's team to take on the United States.
The 30-year-old is now up to 12th on the European Tour's Race to Dubai money list after almost doubling his season earnings with victory at the Celtic Manor.
"I think it's the best final round I've ever played to win a tournament," said McDowell, the 11th different winner in the Wales Open's 11-year history.
"That has been coming for a while and I played phenomenal in the final 11 holes on Friday, I played lovely on Saturday and I came out and did the same on Sunday.
Watching European captain Montgomerie would have been impressed as he saw a dramatic final round unfold on the course that will host the Ryder Cup from 1 October.
The final Celtic Manor leaderboard had a home nations feel with a Northern Irishman, a Welshman, two Englishmen and a Scot making up five of the top six places in front of a record 15,820 crowd in Newport.
McDowell - who once lived in south Wales - started four strokes adrift but began quickly with six birdies in his opening eight holes, starting by holing a 20-foot putt on the first to birdie the 465-yarder.
Home hope Davies celebrated his second successive second place to move tantalisingly close to the one million Euro barrier.
Bidding to be the first Welsh winner of the tournament, the 25-year-old started his final round steadily with three successive pars before an incredible eight holes where he picked up eight shots.
Davies, who won the Hassan II tournament in Morocco earlier this year, picked up six birdies and a superb eagle on the 439-yard par four eighth - sinking an eight-iron approach.
The Welshman saved par at the par-four 14th after dropping into the water, but the European Tour rookie recovered to eagle another par four as he took just two shots at the 377-yard 15th.
Davies suffered his first dropped shot of the afternoon at the par-four 16th but still lowered the Twenty Ten course record to 62.
That came just hours after Marc Warren had equalled the previous best - set on Saturday by fellow Scotsman Stephen Gallacher - as he fired 63 to end on four under.
Davies is renowned as an impeccable putter and he needed just 22 putts in his final round that secured his fifth top-three finish in an impressive rookie season.
His £200,000 runners-up cheque should move him to fifth in the top five of the European Tour's Race to Dubai money list and just outside the automatic Ryder Cup qualification places to face the Americans.
Davies joins Bradley Dredge, who was second behind South African Richard Sterne in 2007, as the closest Wales have had to a home winner.
Two-time Ryder Cup winner Donald shot an excellent and unblemished final round of 65 to move up from joint 14th overnight to finish third - following on from second at the PGA Championship at Wentworth and his win at last week's Madrid Masters.
At Silverstone, a partisan crowd turns up hoping to see a first home win since David Coulthard in 2003, but, despite starting on pole, Hamilton comes in third after getting his car set-up wrong.
He crashes during qualifying for the European GP at Germany's Nurburgring but is fit to start from 10th on the grid.
However, he finishes outside the points for the first time after spinning off in the wet - he rejoins the race but finishes down in ninth.
The programme was first broadcast on 5 April 1966 from Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, West London.
In the week of its first broadcast, The Radio Times described the Money Programme as "a new weekly magazine about international business".
In the early years the Money Programme was fronted by "commentators" - distinguished financial journalists who gave viewers an insight and an understanding into Britain's new economic reality.
But the programme had soon established itself and was making headlines - like the edition in November 1977 when Sir James Goldsmith appeared to answer questions from financial journalists James Bellini and Hugh Stephenson on his company Cavenham Limited.
In the event, Sir James accused the programme of telling lies and promptly stormed off the set.
By the 1980s the Programme had been completely transformed.
A new glossy magazine format was introduced with two new presenters, Valerie Singleton and Brian Widlake, who helped to bring the programme to a wider audience.
Stories about the London Stock Exchange's Big Bang were as important as the best mortgage deals on the High Street.
Since then the reputation of the programme has grown and a roll call of the biggest names and the biggest companies in the world have appeared on the programme.
In 2001 the Programme was given a new look, changing from a magazine to a single subject documentary.
The new format has proved a great success with increased audiences, even greater press attention and a clutch of awards for its programmes.
Extras stars Gervais as a man who gives up his day job to become an actor but has trouble finding major roles.
The show features cameos from stars including Kate Winslet and Ben Stiller.
Other highlights of the season include a second series of The Catherine Tate Show and Sensitive Skin, a dark comedy starring Joanna Lumley.
The show follows the ups and downs of a successful couple, played by Lumley and Denis Lawson, living in London.
BBC Two controller Roly Keating promised the season would bring "great new comedy from some of Britain's best comic talent".
Among the new factual programmes are The Monastery, in which five laymen face the challenge of living the life of a monk for 40 days.
In How To Start Your Own Country Danny Wallace, who became famous for his Random Acts Of Kindness collective, goes on a quest to create a new territory.
Other documentaries will include the TV premiere of The Fog Of War, the Oscar-winning film about the life of former US secretary of Defence Robert McNamara.
Keating said that the channel's drama line-up would feature "plenty of the depth and scale that viewers expect from BBC Two landmark series".
Sport will also play a part in the spring line-up, with BBC Two screening coverage of the Women's European Football Championships, which are being held in England.
Instead the broadcaster will screen eight special episodes of the programme's archive spin-off, TOTP2.
Top of the Pops was decommissioned in 2006 after 42 years on the air.
"We said at that time the Christmas Special would continue but would have to earn its place every year," said a BBC spokesman.
Last year's Top of the Pops seasonal special featured such acts as Girls Aloud, the Proclaimers and singer Kate Nash.
It also saw X Factor winner Leon Jackson perform When You Believe, 2007's Christmas number one.
Earlier this month rising pop act the Ting Tings said they would be happy to see Top of the Pops return.
Kaiser Chiefs and 1980s icon Adam Ant have also called for the show to be resurrected.
Henry McLeish had been Scotland's first minister for just over a year when he tendered his resignation.
He was elected to the position following the death of Donald Dewar and inherited the toughest job in Scottish politics.
Mr McLeish had a tough act to follow in Donald Dewar - the great father of Scottish politics whom, even from his sick bed, could exert control over his team.
Mr McConnell had solid rank and file support, but it was thought Mr McLeish's experience as an MP at Westminster helped him secure the post.
By the time Mr McLeish took the hot seat, the face of Scottish politics had changed.
Alex Salmond had gone as Scottish National Party leader and first minister's questions now featured two new names, Mr McLeish and John Swinney.
On the question of policy, a major defining issue for Mr McLeish has been free personal care for the elderly.
The Sutherland Commission recommended that, when older people need basic help to wash, dress and cook, it should be provided free at the point of use and not be means tested.
The executive's knee-jerk reaction was to reject the costly proposal.
Scotland's elderly would have the free service, said the new leader, at a cost of �110m per year.
He had silenced the opposition and his populist move was applauded up and down the country.
But adulation was short lived.
The announcement reportedly left Labour at Westminster feeling uneasy.
Although Mr McLeish had made a clear decision on a matter devolved to Holyrood it had implications for England and Wales.
The obvious retort was, if Scotland's elderly can get free personal care so should those in the rest of the UK.
The executive was hoping part of the cost would be recouped through the �55 a week "attendance allowance" most elderly and infirm people receive from the UK benefits system.
But the Treasury was reported to have flexed its muscles and said it would not allow Scotland to opt out of the UK's unified social security system.
Westminster had already been bruised by a student tuition fees deal north of the border and a similar post-devolution problem seemed to have emerged.
Other tensions between Edinburgh and Westminster have been evident during Mr McLeish's tenure.
He stepped in and insisted the executive should be referred to as a "government" after suggestions that it should change its title to avoid confusion with the government at Westminster.
And, less judiciously, he was overheard making less than flattering remarks about ministerial colleagues Dr John Reid and Brian Wilson during a discussion with Scottish Secretary Helen Liddell after the general election.
McLeish also found himself bunkered when he sought to put his personal stamp on Scotland's 2009 Ryder Cup bid, which was effectively lost to a competitor in Wales.
Scotland was awarded the competition four years later, but the campaign was seen by many as a disaster.
However, in March this year Mr McLeish was accused of having a lack of control after reports that Enterprise Minister, Wendy Alexander, "threw a tantrum" when she was ordered to take responsibility for water authorities in the wake of Environment Minister Sam Galbraith's resignation.
In the same month, the first minister had to handle the resignation of the Liberal Democrat deputy minister for parliament Tavish Scott.
The MSP went after rebels voted to defeat the Scottish Executive over funding for the fishing industry.
At the time, Mr McLeish admitted fears that the issue might "pose problems" for the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition.
Before events in October and November, March might have been seen as Mr McLeish's toughest month.
But on Thursday the first minister capitulated to calls for his resignation, ending a brief but turbulent period at the top.
The Spaniard took just 19 minutes to take the opening set and when Rochus did win a game, in the ninth, it was met with a huge cheer in the arena.
The Belgian improved but Nadal powered to victory in one hour and 17 minutes.
Home favourite Lleyton Hewitt bowed out after a 5-7 6-2 6-2 3-6 6-3 defeat to number 13 seed Fernando Gonzalez.
The Australian converted his first break point for the opening set before Gonzalez hit back to win the next two.
Hewitt dominated the fourth but seemed to drop his intensity and Gonzalez finished by serving out to love.
Nadal, who was rarely troubled en route to victory over Rochus, dismissed any concerns about his knee problems.
"I'm just trying to improve and be humble because every match is different," he told the crowd.
He added that it was not intention to send a warning out to his rivals following his easy win.
"I'm not thinking about that, I'm just trying to make sure I play well myself," said the current Wimbledon champion.
Fifth seed Tsonga, last year's runner-up, had been a doubt before the tournament with a back injury but was in scintillating form as he swept past Juan Monaco 6-4 6-4 6-0.
There was little to choose between the pair in the first two sets but Gasquet took one of six break points to win the third.
The Frenchman saw a 4-2 lead eroded in the fourth set but then broke at 4-4 before serving out the match.
"You can't get a much more exciting three-setter," Blake said.
"It was a little too exciting but he played some great tennis.
The Chilean produced some scintillating groundstrokes against 2005 runner-up Hewitt but he required treatment for cramp during the final set and appeared exhausted by the end.
Hewitt said he paid the penalty for a lack of match practice following hip problems last year.
"I'll probably look back at it in a couple of days' time, look at where I could have improved and whatever," said Hewitt.
"But in hindsight, when you haven't had the matches, haven't played five sets for quite a while, you're always going to be fighting it a little bit.
The "i" newspaper, the first national newspaper to be launched in 25 years, celebrates its first birthday.
Businessman Evgeny Lebedev is its owner and explains his place in the UK's newspaper industry.
Peter Karim and 60 of his fighters have agreed to end their war against the government, a UN spokesman said.
Two of the Nepali UN troops were released in June, and the remaining five were freed on Saturday.
A UN spokesman in the Democratic Republic of Congo described the news as a boost before this month's elections.
Mr Karim and his Front of Nationalists and Integrationists (FNI) militia are one of several armed groups based in the volatile, mineral-rich north-eastern Ituri province.
The UN mission in DR Congo (Monuc) has been helping the Congolese army to disarm militias across the east, ahead of elections on 30 July.
The polls are intended to end the transition period following the official end of DR Congo's five-year war in 2003.
There are some 17,000 UN troops in DR Congo - the largest peacekeeping force in the world.
Herman Thomas, 48, denies the charges, which include sodomy, kidnapping, extortion, sex abuse and assault.
Up to 15 current and former prisoners are set to testify against him at the jury trial.
He was once the Democratic Party's choice to be the first black federal judge in south Alabama.
Mr Thomas resigned as a judge in 2007 following allegations that he spanked inmates in his private office at the county courthouse with a paddle.
In April this year, he was indicted on more serious charges.
If he is convicted of the charges of kidnapping, he could face a sentence of life in prison.
Court records show that some of the inmates involved said they were checked out of jail for meetings with the defendant in either his car or in his office.
They claim they were abused during these meetings.
However, Mr Thomas's lawyer, Robert Clark, has said the alleged victims were trying to ruin his client's career.
In April, he described the situation as a "a high-tech lynching" and said it was politically motivated.
Mr Thomas's licence to practise has already been suspended.
He has previously said he was trying to mentor the inmates.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a civil rights organisation, has said that Mr Thomas is being prosecuted because of his race.
The trial is set to last several weeks.
The students attacked American troops at the Yongsan Base in the latest violent explosion of anger since the girls were crushed to death by an armoured vehicle taking part in a training mission.
Anti-US activists have rejected as insincere a series of official US apologies for the accident, which took place in a rural area north of Seoul.
South Korean political groups, and North Korea, have seized upon the accident to press for a US troop withdrawal.
The US embassy has been attacked and there have been other peaceful demonstrations against the continued US presence.
In the latest incident, the students ran 50 metres inside the army headquarters before scuffling with US military and South Korean civilian police.
They shouted "Yankee go home", demanding the withdrawal of the 37,000 US troops stationed in South Korea.
South Korean police said the protests were soon stopped and the students were removed from the base in under 10 minutes.
Colonel Peter Champagne, the military police commander, issued a statement saying that the intrusion was quelled quickly by officers.
"This was a difficult situation because they were being kicked and physically assaulted by many of the trespassers," he said.
A spokeswoman for the US military command, Lee Ferguson, said two American military policemen and an Army lieutenant were "kicked and pummeled" by the protesters but were not seriously injured.
"The injuries were mostly bruising, and none of them was hospitalised," she said.
One student was sent for medical treatment with a severe bruise on his ribs, said Sergeant Lee Hee-sung of the South Korean police.
South Korean prosecutors questioned the two soldiers on Monday, although the US military has yet to respond to Seoul's request to try them in a local court.
If convicted in a US military court, the men face up to six years in a US prison.
A South Korean civilian court could issue a maximum jail sentence of five years on the same charge.
The last time companies activated this initial stage of alert was after the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center.
"White alert" - the first of four stages that culminate in "red alert" and the evacuation of all employees - has already exerted a dampening influence on Indonesia's ex-pat communities.
In the oil town of Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, ex-pats have been warned to put aside $500 in cash and have passports at the ready.
Security guards outside office blocks, marine facilities and oil wells now carry machine guns and check for bombs under cars.
Meanwhile, wives and families are mulling advice from various foreign offices around the world to leave the country.
Those left behind are finding their work disrupted by bomb threats - the Jakarta Stock Exchange was forced to evacuate its premises on Thursday.
The spectre of a mass exodus will no doubt deal yet another blow to Indonesia's already fragile business confidence.
"The impact on business sentiment is potentially more serious that the direct impact on tourism," says Andrew Steer, the World Bank's country director for Indonesia.
Only four years ago, as ethnic riots rocked Jakarta, multinationals removed non-essential personnel by the plane-load.
"Oil people are not easily frightened," says Dr Jonathan Pincus from the School of African and Oriental Studies (SOAS) in London.
Following the Bali bombing, ExxonMobil is reviewing its security and putting appropriate measures in place.
However, for all its trials, there is never talk of pulling out.
"We are committed to long-term investment in Indonesia," says spokeswoman Deva Rachman.
Indonesia's status as one of Asia's most prospective oil zones remains a powerful lure not only for ExxonMobil, but also for France's TotalfinaElf, and America's Unocal and ChevronTexaco (Caltex).
But, however robust the oil companies may be, Indonesia's economy is still very vulnerable to this latest shock.
The World Bank has attempted to nurse the country back to health and was recently encouraged by a "slow" recovery.
This year the economy was forecast to expand at almost 4%, but Mr Steer says that the Bali bombing and subsequent drop-off in tourism could knock off about 1%.
"It's very bad news for the economy - it couldn't come at a worse time," adds SOAS' Dr Pincus.
But the real concern will be the impact on Indonesian consumers, who may decide to keep their wallets firmly in their pockets with the threat of more violence and general economic uncertainty.
Most agree that Indonesia's fate hinges on the resolve of its president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and her ability to restore confidence.
"The worst-case scenario will be if we don't see any legitimate security response from the government," says John Green, a political analyst at the consulting and advisory firm, Eurasia, in New York.
However, there are hopes that the scale of the Bali bombing, relative to previous attacks in the country, will spur the government into action.
"Until now security was not taken seriously enough at the political level," says one observer in Jakarta.
"This has woken up the government and broken the opposition.
The World Bank's Mr Steer is also optimistic that the new momentum will yield economic reform.
Certainly, while the identity of the bombers behind the Bali tragedy remains murky, investors will be looking for maximum reassurance.
And in the many cities like Jakarta and Balikpapan, many more people will be hoping to resume normal life again - or at least as normal as it gets in Indonesia.
National Savings and Investments (NS&I) will reduce interest paid on most of its variable rate deals by half a percentage point from 22 October.
If provides a 100% guarantee on deposits, unlike most UK financial institutions where the safety threshold is a recently-increased figure of �50,000.
The interest rate of its Direct ISA decreased on 8 October, while changes to Premium Bonds will take effect from 1 November and Income Bonds from 6 November.
The odds of winning a prize with each �1 Premium Bond will lengthen from 22,000 to one, to 24,000 to 1.
"This means that someone with the maximum �30,000 invested could, with average luck, win 15 prizes a year," a NS&I spokesman said.
The protest started during the funeral of Magomed Yevloyev, the owner of an opposition website who died after being shot in police custody.
Reports said protesters were dispersed by baton-wielding officers.
But an Ingushetia interior ministry official denied the police had forced the demonstrators to leave.
Magomed Mutsolgov, from human rights group Mashr, said police officers arrived early in the morning to disperse a crowd of about 50 men in the main square in Nazran.
Police and military vehicles were then deployed to block access to the main square, he added.
His account tallied with a report on Russian Ren TV from one of its correspondents in the city.
But an interior ministry press officer insisted the protesters had left peacefully.
"We didn't even have to make any arrests," the official said.
Police said he was shot after lunging for an officer's gun, but his supporters and human rights groups said they did not believe that explanation.
Russian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the death.
Mr Yevloyev was a thorn in the side of Ingush President Murat Zyazikov, a former KGB general.
There is a low-level insurgency, with regular ambushes of police and soldiers.
In the latest incident in the region, on Monday, two policemen were killed and one wounded in an ambush at a police station in the village of Achaluki, Interfax reported.
Mr Yevloyev was the most high-profile Russian journalist to be killed since assassins shot investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya at her Moscow apartment in October 2006.

Photorealistic characters, vast game environments in high-definition detail, and artificial intelligence continue to improve.
But as the visible parts of games get closer to perfection, the tools used to tell the story in the game are also due an overhaul, according to some veteran games industry figures.
Both Peter Molyneux, head of Lionhead Studios, and David Braben, head of Frontier Developments, agree that the industry is focusing on new ways to add greater depth to stories.
"At the moment there's a huge amount of talk about story and narrative, branching plots and multiple endings, and player-directed content," Mr Molyneux said.
The industry needed to find new alternatives to existing, outmoded storytelling techniques, said Mr Molyneux, whose firm is working on the sequel to its award winning role-playing title Fable.
Many video games move story forward by using "cut scenes", short expositional interludes which punctuate the play.
But cut scenes suffer from several different problems.
Mr Molyneux said they were "tragic moments in gameplay because gamers' patience and tolerance for cut scenes are measured in seconds".
Research shows that many gamers skip cut scenes, preferring to get straight back into the action, he said.
And it is not just players that they frustrate, they also cause problems for game makers too.
The main problem is tailoring play so it reaches a point where using a cut scene makes sense, said Mr Braben, a 25-year industry veteran, who made his name with classic title Elite.
"So what you end up with is pinch points in the story which very much dictate the storyline and you almost have a game-over situation if those points aren't met," Mr Braben said.
Creating scenes that can branch in many directions is impractical because the number of possible storylines grows exponentially, said Mr Braben.
And though giving players lots of ways to get through a game sounds good, the psychology of the average gamer confounds its usefulness, Mr Molyneux has found.
"The tragic thing we found with multiple branching is what actually happens is that when gamers spoke to each other about their experiences they felt they had done the task the wrong way," said Mr Molyneux.
But in spite of the complications, developers are seeking ways to give gamers more say in directing the action.
Frontier's current project, The Outsider, is a political thriller in which the main character is falsely accused of killing the US president.
"We've chosen a story where it makes sense for the player to go in many different directions," said Frontier head David Braben.
But increasing the number of game choices impacts on other aspects of game development.
"Because of branching complexity, where Fable had 20,000 lines of dialogue, Fable 2 has about 250,000," said Mr Molyneux.
And it is not just in story that the games industry is looking to improve, it is looking to Hollywood scriptwriters and directors for help to improve dialogue and characterisation.
Frontier continues to draw on film industry techniques to create deeper, more engaging characters.
"Most game characters are as shallow as a puddle - they're really lightweight," said Mr Braben.
"We're going through a process - in the same way the film industry does - of putting together character bibles.
"So even though it may not be evident in the story - we know this is where this character grew up, this is why they are the way they are, these are the chips they have on their shoulder," said Mr Braben.
By creating a back story for characters game writers gain a better understanding of their own creations, giving characters greater depth and enriching their dialogue.
"It's astonishing how much of a character's background defines how they would respond to something," said Mr Braben.
The characters' history defines the language they use in different situations, he added.
Many game industry figures see parallels between the evolution of video games and film.
Like the early movie industry, the games sector sees itself as an emerging medium that has yet to mature.
The new technologies emerging in gaming are similar to the shift from silent films to the synchronised sound of "talkies", said Mr Braben.
Silent film producers introduced very little dialogue to early talking films because they did not change their mindset, he said.
But directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles in the 1930s saw cinema as a medium for story-telling not merely a medium for spectacle.
"I'm sitting here as a Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin saying I'm going to become a Hitchcock, hopefully," he said.
Mr Molyneux agrees that the video games industry is in the process of redefining what the medium is capable of.
"The future of storytelling, the future of narrative, the future of what are great compelling moments in entertainment are more likely to be held by what you think of as computer games now than any other medium," he said.
BA flight 223 had been due to leave Heathrow for Washington DC at 1505 GMT on Sunday but departed more than three hours later.
The delay was the result of information about the flight demanded by US authorities for what a BA spokeswoman termed "security purposes".
The same numbered flight was cancelled amid security concerns on Thursday and Friday and delayed on Saturday by extra checks before departure.
With BA's weekend flights to and from Riyadh also cancelled over security concerns, Transport Secretary Alistair Darling said air passengers should expect such delays for years to come.
At the same time Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that "the terrorist threat is real right around the world at the present time".
The prime minister would not go into detail about the specific concerns that had caused the recent delays and cancellations as he spoke to reporters on the way back from a lightning trip to Iraq.
But he said decisions were taken "on the basis of assessments that are made and you just have to judge each set of circumstances as it comes".
Mr Darling - speaking on BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme - would also not go into details but stressed the decisions were "justified" on the basis of intelligence warnings.
Speaker after speaker tells the crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square how they had hoped never to have to battle the threat of new nuclear weapons again.
The London to Aldermaston march was started in 1958 to protest about nuclear weapons.
The fact it is being revived nearly 50 years later shows how much, in the campaigners' eyes, remains to be done.
People who went on the first four-day march as children - some now grey-haired grandparents - wonder how many times they must fight this fight.
But despite their despondency, fresh energy can be seen in the bright banners and costumes of the protesters.
Hundreds have shown up, many with backpacks strapped on ready for the 50-mile hike to Aldermaston in Berkshire, stopping in west London, Slough and Reading on the way.
Joint organisers Slough4Peace have arranged accommodation and food in community halls but warn it will not be luxury for the footsoldiers.
Charlotte Paterson, who was one of 10,000 people to go on the first trek 44 years ago, recalls the musicians who accompanied the marchers then.
"It was a very new thing to do in those days, to have a big march - it was all new and exciting.
"There was a tremendous determination about stopping nuclear weapons, which was again quite a new issue for most of us.
"My brother and sister were older than me and were allowed to stay the night but I wasn't allowed to.
A member of the Aldermaston Women's Peace Campaign, the 54-year-old from Bristol still joins the group's monthly protest camp outside the plant's high fence.
"I think we are much more effective now because we are much more sophisticated now in our knowledge of nuclear weapons," she says.
"We know what happens when you drop one, like in Hiroshima, but we also know about the problems of making them - the low level radiation and its effects on health and the pollution that they release into the air and the water.
Student CND member Peter Leary, 24, is one of a younger generation who shares these fears.
On Easter Monday, the marchers are expected to arrive, footsore and weary, in Aldermaston for a "surround the base" demonstration outside the plant.
Hundreds of people will link hands around the six-mile fence in a human chain.

Mr Darling said the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation would reduce CO2 gas emissions by one million tonnes a year.
Friends of the Earth welcomed the move but said growth in travel would offset any environmental gains by 2015.
Mr Darling announced the government's proposal at an Environmentally Friendly Vehicles Conference in Birmingham.
He said a one million tonne reduction in carbon dioxide emissions was equivalent to taking one million cars off the road.
"Making vehicles more efficient and investing in public transport are important aspects of our strategy, but renewable fuels are equally important," he said.
Many come from crops such as oilseed rape and wheat, which can be mixed with petrol or diesel for use in ordinary cars.
The UK Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA) said biofuels had a role to play in reducing C02 emissions.
But a spokesman said emissions in the transport sector had stabilised and were predicted to fall as fuel became cleaner and vehicles more efficient.
"The approach which is being adopted is quite bureaucratic because it's going to require quite a lot of paperwork in terms of accreditation of biofuels," he said.
British Petroleum said it supported moves to reduce carbon emissions and had been working closely with the government to ensure the obligation was practical.
"We would want the final proposal to be something that's clearly going to make a difference to the environment but also wouldn't be an unnecessary burden on UK motorists," a spokesman said.
Total UK said it would work with the government to find the "most appropriate approach" to meet their objectives.
"Use of biofuels must be tied to a strong assurance scheme to ensure their production doesn't damage the countryside, encourage the destruction of tropical rainforests or promote intensive farming of GM crops," Friends of the Earth said.
But the Department for Transport said the government would develop a carbon and sustainability assurance scheme as part of the obligation.
"Obligated companies would be required to report on the level of carbon savings achieved and on the sustainability of their supplies," it said.
Mr Darling also said the government would further investigate the potential for the use of hydrogen fuel in the UK.
Thames Valley Police has been planning for the club's arrival for months and said it is prepared for Wimbledon's first home game at the city's National Hockey Stadium.
Wimbledon's players are expected to play their first home match at their temporary home in late September or early October.
Officers overseeing policing for the club's home games said they want to ensure matches have a family environment and are ready to deal with any troublemakers.
"Our message is clear - if supporters are coming to Milton Keynes to enjoy the matches then they will be welcomed by my officers.
The club, which is currently playing its home games at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park, will be based in the hockey stadium for the next two years while it looks for a place to build a permanent home.
However, the move away from Wimbledon's tradition roots in London has angered many fans who have since boycotted matches.
Work converting the hockey stadium is almost completed - a new pitch was being laid, turnstiles have been installed and the goalposts and managers' dugouts are due to arrive soon.
The Dublin-born actor, who was in his mid-30s, featured in a number of Irish films and TV dramas in recent years.
His roles included Paul in Adam and Paul, a priest in the TV series Trouble in Paradise and a video store manager in the film Intermission.
He had won a Tony Award for his Broadway performance in the Druid company's production of The Beauty Queen of Leenane in 1998.
Druid Artistic Director Garry Hynes said the actor died on Saturday and the company was "terribly saddened".
"A wonderful colleague and friend, he will be much missed by his many friends in the film and theatre business," she said.
Marie Mullen - co-founder of the company - led a round of applause at the curtain of Long Day's Journey into Night at the Gaiety Theatre as did many other theatres in Dublin.
When Joan Ruddock was first elected to the Commons in 1987, she was already a well known political campaigner.
She chaired CND for four years from 1981 and was one of the most high profile of the Greenham Common protesters.
She became a spokeswoman on transport in 1989 and remained on the front bench until Labour came to power in 1997.
After Labour's election victory, she was made a parliamentary under-secretary with the role of minister for women.
This was an unpaid position, an irony not lost on commentators at the time, and she was dropped in Tony Blair's first reshuffle.
Since then, she has concentrated on a few key campaigns from the backbenches; she is a strong opponent of GM foods, and was a supporter of changing the law to allow positive action to get more women into Parliament.
She is the partner of Frank Doran MP.
Mr Webster becomes his senior media spokesman, part of efforts to create a battle-ready team in case there is an earlier-than-expected general election.
He worked for ITN for two decades in posts including political and Moscow correspondent, and is now at Five News.
He will work alongside Puja Darbari, Sir Menzies's press secretary, communications director Jon Oates and the party's head of media - who has yet to be appointed.

I'm about six week away from the end.
Tropic Island Hum, based around the adventures of a Liverpudlian squirrel called Wirral, will feature on a DVD to be released on 19 April.
The animated film features a new children's song written by Sir Paul.
Rupert and The Frog Song won a Bafta following its release, and director Geoff Dunbar also made Tropic Island Hum.
Dunbar also worked with the Beatles legend on an animated film about the work of French artist Honore Daumier, which won them a Bafta in 1992.
A somewhat reinvigorated president, in typically belligerent fashion, is trying to show his Communist critics that if they want a fight, he's ready.
But the president has shown for some time that he's disenchanted with his prime minister, openly snubbing him on several public occasions in the last few weeks.
As Boris Yeltsin's health worsened in recent years, Mr Primakov has in fact come to his rescue on more than one occasion.
And when the economy collapsed last autumn, the new prime minister, managed to restore some political and economic stability.
But in so doing he became altogether too popular and powerful for President Yeltsin's liking.
Boris Yeltsin would also like to go down in history as the man who finally redeemed Russia from communism, and he saw that legacy threatened by Mr Primakov's left-leaning government.
The president was clearly annoyed, moreover, by the sight of his prime minister travelling to Belgrade surrounded by generals soon after the first Nato attacks on Yugoslavia.
Soon afterwards, President Yeltsin ordered his government and generals to tone down their rhetoric and handed over the leading role on Kosovo to ex-premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.
It was one thing to condemn the Nato actions, quite another to risk a permanent rift with the West.
In those early hours, until the evening of 26 April, we had not yet realised that the reactor had actually exploded and that there had been a huge discharge of radioactive materials into the atmosphere.
Nobody had any idea that we were facing a major nuclear disaster.
Naturally, we can regret, today, after the fact, that we did not grasp everything more quickly.
Immediately after the accident, the management of the station gave the order to flood the reactor with water, because they were not aware that the reactor had exploded and there was nothing left to extinguish.
Finally, the pool under the reactor and some underground locations were filled up with water.
Scientists were afraid that if the hot mass of nuclear fuel and graphite were to rupture the bottom of the reactor's tank and fall into radioactive water, this would create the conditions for a further nuclear explosion.
There were other threats that needed to be eliminated with the utmost urgency.
Firstly, there remained the danger that the mass at the heart of the reactor would rupture its tank and even blast through the foundations of the building housing the reactor, so coming into contact with the soil and leading to a major contamination of groundwater.
But, of course, our main concern was to evacuate the population from the most contaminated areas.
Quite simply, in the beginning even the top experts did not realise the gravity of the situation.
Certainly, I will not exclude the possibility that certain functionaries, who were afraid of being accused of not having taken the correct measures, had a tendency to embellish their reports.
But, for the most part, I believe that I was kept informed in good faith by my representatives.
We did not cancel the May Day parades [in Kiev and Minsk] because we still did not have information on the full extent of the disaster.
Nowadays, experts think that our fears over the possible contamination of groundwater were exaggerated, and that it was not worth the trouble of installing a "cushion" [concrete slab] underneath the reactor.
The construction of the sarcophagus, all the measures for aquatic protection, most of the measures aimed at decontamination - these were good decisions, even though some of the deactivation did ultimately prove to be superfluous.
At first, scientists thought that the population of Pripyat would be able to return to the city around the end of May or beginning of June.
People left leaving their fridges full of food, without even unplugging them, since they expected to return quickly.
The explosion at Chernobyl showed that we are capable of contaminating the planet for the long term, and of leaving a terrible legacy for future generations.
Today, mankind faces a challenge so huge that, by comparison, the Cold War appears like an incongruous vestige from the past.
Chernobyl clearly demonstrated that each disaster is unique and that no country can be prepared for every eventuality.
That is why we must deploy the maximum amount of effort to prevent disasters.
We can therefore see what enormous responsibility is placed not only on politicians, but on scientists, engineers and designers - their mistakes could cost the life and health of millions of people.
One in four fail to recognise the symptoms of the menopause for up to three years, according to a survey by The Choices Campaign, run by the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Aware Group.
Just under half of the women questioned had waited more than a year before going to their GP - a third had not been to see their at all.
But by turning a blind eye to menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, mood changes and loss of libido, women are at risk of conditions such as osteoporosis, high cholesteroland even Alzheimer's disease that are associated with the loss of female hormone production, doctors warn.
The survey found that even when women do finally decide to make an appointment, one in 10 cancels it because they are concerned about wasting thedoctor's time.
"The long-term risks from not managing the menopause can also have a devastating effect on a woman's life - one in six women will eventually die as a result of an osteoporosis-related hip fracture.
Peter Bowen-Simpkins, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told BBC News Online it was true many women failed to recognise the menopause.
"The main problem is that women may get menopausal symptoms before they stop menstruating.
He said GPs also failed to spot menopausal symptoms for the same reasons.
More than 70,000 dog owners attached to 180 breed clubs are being asked to return information on disease, cause of death, birth defects, and other data.
The Kennel Club-backed survey will give the best picture yet of the frequency of breed-specific illnesses, such as the deafness seen in some Dalmatians.
It is hoped the data can then be used to develop new testing and breeding programmes to eliminate the conditions.
"The intention of the survey is to get - for the very first time - a real feel for the diseases that are out there and how frequently they occur.
But much of the existing data on the prevalence of these diseases is found, by and large, in reports from specialist veterinary referral hospitals or even in the documents of pet insurance claims.
It is, therefore, only a partial picture of sickness, not a comprehensive guide to dog health in the total population.
The new survey will give a more representative idea of what is happening in the wider dog population, and then quick-start a drive to better purebred health.
"We will work with breeders to find ways of having their breeding stock pre-screened," said Dr Sampson.
The Trust's Dr Vicki Adams says that as well as providing baseline data on the frequency of occurrence of health problems, the results may highlight a specific problem in one breed that had not previously been recognised and that may have an inherited component.
Further research will be needed in order to study the causes of any particular disease.
"While some health problems in purebred dogs have been shown to be due to specific genetic mutations, other health problems are thought to result from the selection of animals for breeding according to breed standards," she said.
Through the comparison of our biochemical code with the soon-to-be-finished dog genome, these scientists will hope to identify the particular gene errors that give rise to disease - in both humans and dogs.
Many of the 400 or so inherited disorders reported in canines are also seen in humans.
It is also the case that dog versions of these diseases, particularly the cancers, look more like their human counterparts than some of the induced tumours scientists study in lab rodents.
All of this means there are real spin-offs in dog research for the understanding of human health and behaviour.
Robert Kelly from the American Kennel Club's Canine Health Foundation is in no doubt the UK survey will provide an invaluable resource.
But from this week, some Japanese car drivers will be able to park theirs without even touching the steering wheel.
The Prius, which is Toyota's newest and "greenest" car, has just gone on sale in Japan.
The Japanese car giant say it is a world first because it uses electronic sensors to avoid obstacles and guide it into spaces.
The Prius, which runs on electricity and petrol, was demonstrated at a press launch by Toyota President Fujio Cho.
With both hands away from the wheel, Mr Cho proved its automatic parking ability.
The car uses an intelligent parking system which means it can park itself using electronic sensors.
The sensors judge its position and so allow it to avoid obstacles like other parked cars and kerbs.
In 1997, Toyota became the first car makers to sell a mass-produced hybrid vehicle, and they have sold around 120,000 since then.
Hybrid cars are more efficient than conventional ones because they combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor.
The car maker says it is much more fuel-efficient and therefore greener than other models and are expecting it to be popular.
"Development of eco-friendly cars is a key to our future growth strategy," Mr Cho explained.
Toyota says that due to growing demand for cars which are less harmful to the environment, it expects to sell around 76,000 of the Prius worldwide in 2004.
It aims to produce 300,000 of the eco-friendly hybrid vehicles a year by 2005 or 2006.
Toyota, keen to exploit hybrid car technology, struck a deal with Nissan last year to share information and discuss the joint development of environmentally-friendly technology.
Both hoped the deal would help them boost efficiency and cut costs.
The hybrid Prius will be available in the US this year and the rest of the world in 2004.
It will, however, face competition from General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, who launch their first hybrids later this year.
The money will be used to renovate eight schools in the city, construct a new school in north Bristol and rebuild an existing campus.
Bedminster Down, Henbury, Monks Park and Portway schools will be either rebuilt or refurbished by September 2005 using �49m of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding.
Hartcliffe School will be redeveloped and Bristol City Council is investing �15m of its own resources in rebuilding Fairfield school, probably on the St Thomas More Roman Catholic School site in Horfield.
The council plans to build a new school in the Redland area of north Bristol.
Sited on Redland Playing Fields near Cranbrook Road, the aim is for it to reduce demand for places at oversubscribed Cotham.
The next phase of improvements, to Brislington, Speedwell and Whitefield Fishponds schools, will be completed by 2006.
Bristol City Council said this, together with the Hartcliffe campus scheme, will be funded by PFI bids.
"With the city committed to rebuilding and refurbishing eight schools, we can all look ahead with great confidence.
The funding announcement comes after a troubleshooting education expert was appointed to turn around Bristol's failing schools.
Simon Jenkin began a three-month stint as director of education for the city in March.
A permanent director is still to be appointed.
His skeleton was found in a well in the city during the 1980s - he had been shot in the head and attacked with a sword.
Archaeologists named him 'Duncan', and a �24,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund will fund a reconstruction of his face and exhibition at the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle.
The reconstruction will allow visitors to see how Duncan would have looked more than 1,700 years ago.
Tim Padley, from Tullie House Museum, said without the funding they could not have organised many important elements of the exhibition.
The exhibition, called 'Into the Hands of the Shades - Death in Roman Cumbria', will seek to explain the Romans' beliefs about death and burials.
"We are bringing together a 3rd Century mystery with 21st Century technology and it is sure to capture the imagination of Cumbrian residents".
On Thursday, Leader of the Commons Jack Straw described the Playstation 3 game as "totally unacceptable".
A Sony spokesman declined to comment on the Mr Straw's comments.
Mr Straw was responding to a question from Labour MP Keith Vaz in the Commons on Thursday - a day after Mr Blair responded to questions on the issue.
Sony has previously said it had sought "all permissions necessary" for the game, which has been defended by gaming experts.
Despite the opposing views, Mr Straw asserted that Mr Vaz was "absolutely right".
The row began last week when the dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, condemned its depiction in the game without church permission.
The popular game - which has sold about a million copies - is a science fiction fantasy based in a parallel world in which aliens are trying to take over the planet.
Church officials outlined their concerns in a letter sent to Sony on 11 June, which the company says it has now responded to.
The design for the King Alfred leisure centre site was approved by Brighton and Hove City Council last month as long as certain changes were made.
The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) said it now offered its overall support.
But it said there was "some way to go" on a solution for the public spaces.
The reworked design, for developer Karis, is for a new sports centre and 751 residential units, to include affordable housing, in two towers and eight other buildings.
There will also be shops, restaurants, cafes, bars, a doctor's surgery, police office and public toilets.
The new application reduces the height of some buildings but increases that of others, including the towers.
It increases the number of balconies and roof terraces and adds wind turbines, solar hot water heating and vegetated shingle roofs.
Cabe also urged careful thought about the appearance of the sports centre from the beach.
"The sports centre risks presenting a "back" to the beach, rather than appearing to be an active and inviting public asset," it said.
The council said extensive public consultation and an assessment of the new application was now under way.

David Cameron takes over as PM
• He's 43, was born in London and went to school in Berkshire.
• His family are originally from Scotland and he has some royal blood - he's a direct descendant of King William IV and is a very very distant relative of the Queen.
• David got into politics early on in life working for a Conservative MP when he was 19 before going to university.
• He's the first Conservative Prime Minister for 13 years, and he's been in charge of his party for five years.
• He's the youngest prime minister in nearly 200 years - since Robert Banks Jenkinson, the 2nd Earl of Liverpool took office in 1812.
• He and his wife Samantha have had three children, but their first son Ivan died when he was just six after being born with a rare disease.
• They have another son and daughter and are expecting a fourth child in September.
• David Cameron supports Aston Villa and some of his favourite bands include The Killers, Radiohead and REM.
• He likes jogging and cycling but has had his bicycle stolen a few times!
BBC Sport's Ken Brown and Wayne Grady look at "Flowering Peach", the 3rd hole of the Augusta National Golf Club - home of the Masters.
Sir Ian McKellen, Daniel Radcliffe and Germaine Greer have also landed cameo roles in the BBC Two show.
The series is based around extra Andy Millman, played by Gervais, an actor desperate to break into the big time.
Kate Winslet was among the guest stars in the first series, written by Gervais and comedy partner Stephen Merchant.
Diana Rigg, Moira Stuart, Richard Briers, Ronnie Corbett and Stephen Fry are also included in the line-up for the sitcom's second series, which is due to air later this year.
A BBC spokeswoman said filming began earlier this week and plotlines had not yet been confirmed.
The first series picked up two prizes at the prestigious Rose d'Or TV awards in April, winning best sitcom and best sitcom actress for Ashley Jensen, who plays Gervais' sidekick Maggie.
But the show missed out on two Bafta awards, losing out to Armando Iannucci's political satire, The Thick Of It.
Madonna and punk quartet Panic! At The Disco make five categories, while James Blunt is up for best male video.
Justin Timberlake, Beyonce Knowles and Ludacris will be among the performers at the event in New York on 31 August.
The awards return to the city after two years in Miami, with MTV promising "a little bit of that New York danger".
Dani California by Red Hot Chili Peppers and Shakira's Hips Don't Lie - currently number one in the UK - are both nominated for video of the year.
Blunt is joined in the best male video category by Kanye West, Busta Rhymes, TI and Nick Lachey.
Former 98 Degrees pop star Lachey recreated his break-up with Jessica Simpson in the video for What's Left of Me.
Shakira is up against Kelly Clarkson, Nelly Furtado, Madonna and Aguilera in the best female video category.
The best group video is between the All-American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, Gnarls Barkley, Panic! At The Disco and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
And a "soundtrack" for the awards show will be provided by the Raconteurs, the band led by Jack White of the White Stripes.
Timberlake said he was glad MTV - which is celebrating its 25th birthday - was coming back to New York, where it held its first awards ceremony in 1984.
It had "lost a bit of its lustre" in previous years, he said.
An Oregon team discovered gene transfer produced functioning hair cells that are essential for the inner ear to interpret sounds, Nature reports.
In people with normal hearing, cochlear hair cells convert sound into electrical signals, which are ultimately transmitted to the brain.
Once the cells are lost or damaged, they cannot be replaced naturally.
According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), there are about nine million people who are deaf or hard of hearing in the UK.
Most of them have lost their hearing gradually with increasing age, partly due to the loss of hair cells in the cochlea.
Prolonged exposure to loud noise is another culprit, damaging the hair cells.
John Brigande and his team from Oregon Health and Science University showed, at least in unborn mice, gene therapy can be used to encourage other cells to become hair cells.
Gene therapy uses a harmless virus to insert copies of the key gene into cells which then replicate.
The key gene used by the Oregon team was Atoh1 which is essential for hair cell development.
The cells "treated" with Atoh1 functioned exactly like original hair cells.
"This capability is a crucial first step in defining translational therapies to ameliorate the effects of inner-ear disease in humans," the researchers said.
Work in humans is still a way off, but the findings point to a way to repair the damaged cochlea without using a mechanical or electrical device.
Currently, people can have a cochlear implant which works by bypassing the damaged cochlear hair cells and stimulating the auditory nerve directly.
An implant cannot restore hearing to normal but it does give the sensation of sounds.
During campaigning for Iran's presidential election, Zahra Rahnavard, 64, broke with Iranian political tradition by appearing alongside her husband, reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi.
Campaign posters even showed the couple holding hands, which shocked many in a country where wives have never before taken to the podiums with their husbands.
Dressed in a traditional black headscarf, but with daring floral patterns showing underneath, Ms Rahnavard has gone further than just standing alongside her husband.
She has been an active campaigner, making speeches, attending rallies alone and publicly criticising the incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his treatment of women.
A respected scholar and artist in her own right, Ms Rahnavard has described herself and her husband as "unusual".
"We have the same experience," she told the BBC in an interview shortly before the elections.
Throughout her career, she has advocated greater freedom and equality for women.
She has been dubbed Iran's answer to Michelle Obama, but Mrs Rahnavard does not agree with this description.
Mrs Obama is, she says, America's answer to Zahra Rahnavard.
Zahra Rahnavard, who goes by her maiden name, studied for a teaching certificate before going on to gain a masters degree from the Arts faculty at Tehran University.
She also holds a masters and a doctorate in political science from Azad University and is an accomplished artist, with sculptures on display in several public squares in the capital.
She married Mr Mousavi in the late 1960s and the couple have three daughters.
In the 1970's, Ms Rahnavard was a close acquaintance of dissident intellectual Ali Shariati, and when he was arrested in 1976, she fled to the US.
But she returned to Iran shortly before the 1979 revolution, becoming instrumental in developing many of the new Islamic republic's political, cultural and economic programmes.
She was an adviser to former President Mohammad Khatami during his 1997-2005 terms of office and for most of that time also served as chancellor of the Al Zahra Women's College in Tehran.
She held the influential position for seven years, until Mr Ahmadinejad's election.
Baroness Haleh Afshar, Professor of Politics at York University in the UK, said that throughout her career, Ms Rahnavard has been "pivotal in defending the rights of women" in Iran within an Islamic context.
Her political achievements include getting legal recognition of the rights of women to receive wages in return for housework, said Ms Afshar.
Although Ms Rahnavard's position on the role of women is "fundamentally feminist", she is nevertheless "highly critical of the idea of equality in the West", Ms Afshar told BBC's Woman's Hour.
"She says it doesn't respect women's specific attention to children and domesticity," she said.
Ms Rahnavard is also broadly supportive of Iranian laws requiring women to wear headscarves, saying she would not have the right to reverse the law if she were ever president.
"It has always been in Islam that women have the veil, and it is written in the Koran - tell Muslim women to cover themselves," she told the BBC.
When Mr Ahmadinejad used a pre-election debate with Mr Mousavi to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Ms Rahnavard's qualifications, Mr Mousavi responded by saying his wife was one of "the most important and enlightened women of this country".
Ms Rahnavard herself challenged Mr Ahmadinejad over his comments, publicly calling on him to retract them.
And, in the wake of the disputed election results, despite the arrest of several prominent opposition figures and while her husband was in hiding, Ms Rahnavard appeared a rally in support of her husband.
Her decision and ability to do so perhaps suggests her husband's election defeat does not mean the end of Ms Rahnavard's political ambitions.
The Playstation 2 game quickly sold out in many shops shortly after its release on Friday, suggesting sales could have been even higher.
It seems set to become the biggest-selling game of the year, following its sell-out release in the US earlier this month.
But this does not seem to have dented sales in the UK.
With sales in excess of 250,000, Vice City accounted for half of all the Playstation 2 titles bought this week.
It has easily broken the previous sales record, held by Metal Gear Solid 2, which sold 120,000 copies on release.
Analysts estimate that it is also the highest grossing consumer entertainment product of the week, with an estimated �10 million being spent on the game
Vice City has won rave reviews for its attention to detail in recreating the era of the 1980s.
The game features 80 different tracks from bands including Judas Priest, Blondie, Flock of Seagulls, Kool and the Gang, Hall and Oates, Grandmaster Flash, and Cutting Crew.
Voices are supplied by actors Miami Vice star Phillip Michael Thomas, Ray Liotta and Dennis Hopper, among others.
About 300 students walked out of the meeting as the announcement was made on Friday afternoon.
The university says consolidating activity at its Plymouth base strengthens its work.
It is claimed moving the campus, known as Rolle College, will cost the local economy �20m.
One mature student told the BBC the decision was a real blow.
Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker said there was "clear guidance" to ensure the powers were used proportionately.
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said many would be "highly suspicious".
The numbers mean that 2007/8 was the fourth year in a row that the total number of stop and searches increased, and the figure for suspected terror offences was by far the highest ever.
Almost 90% of searches took place in London, the statistics reveal.
The Metropolitan Police recorded a 266% increase in the number of searches.
The figures also show that police carried out well over a million stops and searches in 2007/8 using powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act - 9% more than the previous year.
There was also a 19% increase in stops and searches in anticipation of violence using public order powers to to 53,250.
Following anti-terrorism searches, some 1,198 people were arrested for other reasons.
Mr Coaker said the rise reflected the police response to the terrorist threat during 2007/8, most notably the events in Haymarket, London.
He added that stop and search was an "important tool" for the officers.
"But we are clear that its use must be proportionate, which is why there is clear guidance about when and how these powers should be exercised and we are working with the police and community groups to ensure that the powers are implemented fairly," Mr Coaker said.
A plethora of political figures will attend, including Douglas Hurd, Sir Menzies Campbell and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor.
They will be joined by writer Katharine Whitehorn and Scottish authors Ian Rankin and Ali Smith.
Presenter James Naughtie and political satirist Rory Bremner will make their traditional appearances at the event, which attracted 5,000 people last year.
The Scottish Book of the Year awards will be a new addition to the festival, with the winner being announced on Friday.
Festival director Alistair Moffat said the authors were central to the four-day event, which ends on 22 June.
"I've been to book festivals as an author where you get treated like a bit of an inconvenience, and I was determined that we would never do that at Borders Book Festival," he said.
"So the authors get treated like royalty, like princes and princesses, despite being paid a pittance.
"With their aggression on Yugoslavia using tremendous military and lethal potential, the governments of the United States, Britain and France have humiliated and embarrassed a historical friendship and alliance between the Yugoslav people and the peoples of the countries concerned.
"The government of Germany has with this aggression re-opened unhealed wounds from World War II.
"The Federal Government has decided to reconsider its diplomatic and other relations with the rest of countries which have directly or indirectly taken part in the armed aggression on Yugoslavia.
The Federal Government also reviewed the current military and security situation in the country following the air strikes.
The Federal Government underlined that all available material resources needed by the armed forces for national defence must be placed at the disposal of the Yugoslav Army and the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a priority.
Arthur Ransome wrote the book Swallows and Amazons in 1930, but also worked in the Soviet Union (which Russia used to be a part of) for British newspapers.
While there British spy bosses used him to send them information, but were worried he worked for the Soviets too.
They later decided that Ransome was loyal to Britain, but was very interested in the Soviet way of life.
Files about security issues are often sealed to stop people learning secrets they may contain, which is why these documents have only just been made available to the public.
The released documents also include tips given to Soviet agents working in London in the 1930s, including where to live and good places to meet other agents.
There was also information on the amazing devices used during WWII and how they may have inspired some of the gadgets used by James Bond.
The author of those books, Sir Ian Fleming, worked for the Navy during the war and may have got the idea for human torpedoes used in Thunderball from techniques used by Italy during that time.
Keep Britain Tidy says a quarter of rubbish has been chucked away by people after they've finished their food.
The three worst offenders were people who ate in McDonald's, general fish and chip shops, and Greggs the bakery.
Researchers spent two days in 10 cities in England to find out which companies were responsible for the most litter.
Fast food litter louts uncovered
The survey found that burger wrappers, sauce sachets and plastic straws made up a lot of the rubbish.
Phil Barton, from Keep Britain Tidy, said companies should do more to encourage people not to drop litter.
A spokeswoman for McDonald's said plenty of bins were provided, and customers were encouraged to throw away their litter responsibly.
Brown accepts Hull wage bill cap
Brown is under pressure to trim about £9m from the wage bill and has already had inquiries about the two players.
"Caleb has expressed a desire to leave and we have agreed to it," said Brown.
Brown said chairman Adam Pearson's financial constraints meant departures were inevitable.
"I can't do anything else but accept it," said Brown.
"He is the man in charge and if that is the deal I will try to get on with it.
Winger Kevin Kilbane is another possible departure on loan, with Wolves thought to be interested, and Middlesbrough are keeping tabs on Dutch striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink.
But Brown insisted he was looking to rebuild the squad as much as trim it down, and if the money was available he would like to sign another striker.
In a trading statement, M&S attributed the strong sales to its marketing efforts and to the early Easter holiday.
The sales rise marked a nine-month period of strong sales performance which has helped M&S to revive its fortunes.
"We still have a long way to go to recover lost ground, but I am confident that by continuously driving improvements for our customers we can secure the recovery," said chairman and chief executive Luc Vandevelde.
"I am delighted that our customers continue to react positively to the on-going improvements we are making to the appeal of our clothing and to the store environment," said Mr Vandevelde.
Some analysts said M&S may find it hard to retain its sales growth if higher interest rates and higher taxes lead to weaker consumer spending in the UK.
Indeed, although the company is optimistic about the future, it has said it does not expect a summer spending spree by customers.
The shows will be on BBC Two for three months from January, with executives considering a permanent switch.
The move aims to "iron out a scheduling anomaly" caused by big news stories and national events being screened on BBC One, said a BBC spokeswoman.
It may end a tradition which began with the Multi-Coloured Swap Shop in 1976.
The channel's Saturday morning output has also included Saturday Superstore with Mike Read and Live and Kicking, which was fronted by Andi Peters and Emma Forbes.
During the three-month trial, BBC One's Saturday morning schedule, including Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow and Top Of The Pops Reloaded, will move to BBC Two.
BBC Two's Saturday morning schedule, which includes Breakfast and Saturday Kitchen, will move the other way.
A spokeswoman said BBC One's Saturday programmes changed channel five times this year to make way for coverage of the Prince of Wales's wedding and reports following the London bombings.
Sporting events planned for next summer, including the football World Cup, could also disrupt programmes, said the BBC.
"On other days of the week, children's programmes are on BBC Two," the spokeswoman said.
She added it was not about "performance figures" and that children's programmes were not being relegated.
"It's about trying to provide our viewers with consistency so they know where to find our programmes," she said.
To many people around the UK the results of Ofcom's broadband speed survey came as no surprise when it was published this week.
Several factors decide this rate but the main one is "sync speed", says Richard Shaw from SamKnows, a broadband measurement site and Ofcom's technical partner.
"You could think of it like a greeting between two people at the start of a phone call before the main conversation starts," says Mr Shaw.
"It's like a phone call with lots of noise in the background, you only might be able to hear half of what the other party is saying, whereas with no noise you can hear everything," says Mr Shaw.
Other much smaller factors that affect speed include using cheap hardware and using phone extensions which introduce interference.
"Distances apply to cable length and BT Wholesale does not publish how the cables are laid out on our streets," says Mr Jezowicz.
Conservative defence spokesman Iain Duncan Smith condemned the government for not providing British soldiers in the country with adequate protection.
Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he backed the initial decision to send troops in to help British nationals flee the fighting and support the Sierra Leone Government while the UN built up its strength there.
"The UN have not been capable of securing the area and have been just short of pathetic.
"We either now take the decision to withdraw British troops - which I would favour - and tell the UN to get on with the job they were told to do in the first place, or else we decide, if we put British troops in, they have got to be properly protected.
Mr Hoon insisted that British troops "still had a job to do", but added that their work there was nearly done.
"There is no question of us withdrawing our troops at this time," he said.
"If, as a result of that, we do need to take a different approach to ensuring the safety and security of British troops in Sierra Leone, let me make it quiteclear we will do that," he told Today.
Later, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook hit back at the Tories' idea, saying a withdrawal would give comfort to the rebels.
"We are committed to repelling the rebels in Sierra Leone and restoringstability to its people," he said.
Britain's involvement in Sierra Leone may last onlyanother six weeks, the estimated time of the final training mission, he said.
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell called for Britain to contribute a battalion of troops to the UN force, which is being upgraded from 13,500 to 20,000.
Nicky Wroe opened the scoring from the spot after Olly Lancashire had tugged down Elliot Benyon in the box.
Benyon got the second himself when he rifled home at the near post after good work from winger Mustapha Carayol.
Guy Branston received a second yellow after a foul on Akpa Akpro but United remained composed and added another when Carayol slotted in the third.
"Fantastic performance by the players, it was a great result and we were keen to continue where we had left off.
"The pitch didn't allow us to be at our fluent best at times, so we decided to push Scott Rendell up and go direct and it paid off with the players adapting well.

"The facility is better than anything I have worked with, in England or in France," Collins told the club website.
"It will be of great help in producing talented footballers for the club.
The Easter Road club announced plans for the development in East Lothian in May 2006 and the players are now set to reap the benefits.
The new centre has five international size grass pitches and a floodlit international size Fifa two-star synthetic pitch.
The indoor facilities also include a short-sided pitch with the same artificial surface.
There is a fully equipped gym, medical facilities and a hydro-therapy pool.
The facility also has a players' lounge, dining rooms and kitchen, plus administration offices and meeting rooms.
"The need for access to better training facilities had been identified as a priority by successive managers and to be able to deliver the club's own top class training centre is very satisfying.
Unlike other types of diabetes, the form - dubbed type 3 by the US Brown Medical School team - is not thought to affect blood sugar.
Type 3 affects brain insulin levels, and appears to be linked with Alzheimer's disease.
The team's research appears in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes occur when the body is unable to produce or use insulin from the pancreas.
The so-called 'type 3' diabetes refers to lower than normal levels of newly discovered brain insulin, which appears to be associated with Alzheimer's disease in some way.
Scientists have known for some time that people with diabetes have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease - by up to 65%.
They have also discovered that many type 2 diabetics have deposits of a protein in their pancreas which is similar to the protein deposits found in the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer's disease.
Research has been going on to find out what links the two conditions.
Dr Suzanne de la Monte and colleagues now believe it is down to what they are calling type 3 diabetes.
By looking at rodents and post-mortem brain tissue from people with Alzheimer's disease they have found that insulin and its related proteins are actually produced in the brain, and that reduced levels of both are linked to Alzheimer's disease.
They say this insulin and its related growth factors and receptors in the brain are vital for the survival of brain cells.
If they are not produced at normal levels, the cells die.
In the case of Alzheimer's, the cells that die are located in the part of the brain involved with memory, called the hippocampus.
Not only does this opens the way for targeted treatment to the brain and changes the way we view Alzheimer's disease, "it raises the possibility of a type 3 diabetes", she said.
"There is some evidence to suggest that poorly controlled diabetes also affects the functioning of the brain.
"Scientists have suggested that the link could be down to molecular changes affected by insulin.
"Work funded by the Alzheimer's Research Trust is currently investigating the way insulin acts on the brain and should improve our understanding of Alzheimer's and hopefully lead to way to new treatments.
But he said there was evidence that diabetes and Alzheimer's are linked in some way.
Ten years after one of the worst disasters in British transport history, fresh fears have arisen about the safety of the London Underground.
Thirty-one people died in the Kings Cross fire which broke out as commuters headed home on November 18, 1987.
But the Managing Director of London Underground, Dennis Tunnicliffe, says there is no need for alarm.
Fire brigade sources say that although smoking is banned they are finding more cigarette butts on the floors of stations and are keen to point out that the risks of smoking are too great to be ignored.
Locals, religious leaders and members of the emergency services were invited to join the Rector of Hatfield, Rev Richard Pyke, in the parish church to light candles and reflect in peace.
Work has also continued on removing the three remaining overturned carriages from the crash site.
The victims of the crash were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex, Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds, Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottingham, and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.
Mr Prescott told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost programme that safety was his "top priority".
Railtrack would be given help to free up extra funds for track maintenance and renewal, he indicated.
According to newspaper reports, rail industry regulator Tom Winsor will on Monday announce grants of about �5bn over five years, increasing original estimates by about �1bn.
"What the regulator will be announcing tomorrow is the access charges to achieve that kind of expenditure," Mr Prescott said.
The government would meet "so much of the money", he went on, and the private sector train operating companies the rest.
Mr Prescott warned that he could withdraw Railtrack's operating licence if it failed to fulfil safety obligations.
The Health and Safety Executive, one of the agencies charged with advising the deputy prime minister on whether Railtrack is maintaining a safe railway system, will report to him on Tuesday.
Mr Prescott also signalled that the number of train operating companies could be reduced from the current 25, a move recommended by Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett in the wake of Tuesday's crash.
The deputy prime minister also referred to a likely strengthening of the law on corporatemanslaughter.
The government hope to be able to examine the results of a consultation process and Lord Cullen's inquiry into rail safety by next spring, he said.
Tory transport spokesman Bernard Jenkin said the investment in maintenance tobe detailed on Monday was not new money.
Despite the continuing salvage operation the line running through the crash site is expected to remain closed for at least another week.
The site will be handed back to rail operators once the search for evidence is completed and officers are satisfied no "external cause", such as vandalism, was responsible for the derailment.
An interim report has found that a broken rail was the likely cause of the crash, 17 miles north of London's King's Cross station.
The three-minute film shows the driver pushing a three-litre car to its limit on the M23 in Sussex.
The clip was posted on the YouTube website by "paulscav".
In a statement, YouTube said it would give details to police if asked, but under its rules it was not considered offensive and it would not be removed.
During the clip the driver films his speedometer and then the view from his vehicle as it races down the outside lane of a stretch of the M23 lined by conifer trees.
Motorists are seen to move out of the way as the car reaches speeds of up to 125mph.
"So this sort of content is not only found on the internet.
Sussex Police have warned that anyone filming such activity could themselves be caught on camera and taken to court.
The video has prompted the RAC Foundation to renew calls for website operators to remove clips that glorify speeding on public roads.
Head of campaigns Sheila Rainger said it was very worried by the "growth of this phenomenon".
She added that the internet was giving boy racers a worldwide audience and encouraging "impressionable and foolish people to try to follow suit and try and go one better".
"We think it's got to be nipped in the bud before we see even more accidents," Ms Rainger said.
Actor and comedian Alan Davies got to the bottom of plenty of mysteries when he starred as TV detective/magician's assistant Jonathan Creek and this week he uses his powers of deduction to predict the results of the first round of Premier League matches in 2011.
Davies also gave his thoughts on the Gunners' season so far, suggesting their title hopes could be undermined by an apparent defensive vulnerability.
Australia retained their Ashes crown after holding off the challenge of a brave Great Britain in the third and final Test at Wigan.
But the thrilling contest was overshadowed when Kangaroos' coach Chris Anderson was taken to hospital after suffering a heart attack.
Britain took an early lead through a Paul Johnson try, but back came Australia courtesy of Darren Lockyer and Matthew Gidley.
The introduction of Leeds star Keith Senior was inspirational and the centre made two superb 60-metre runs.
But whereas Australia took advantage of their forays into the final third, the same could not be said for Britain.
To rub salt into the wounds, Australia stand-off Trent Barrett went over twice in the final 10 minutes to widen the gap to 20 points.
David Waite's Britain had a point to prove after their humiliating 40-12 defeat in the second Test last Saturday, and they made their intentions felt in the opening few minutes.
Bradford Bulls' star Paul Deacon's kick was collected by Australia's Nathan Blacklock, but the winger was forced into touch.
From the resulting six, Gary Connolly played a superb pass into the hands of Paul Johnson, who made sure he gave Britain the perfect start from 10 metres out.
Lions' captain Andrew Farrell missed the extra, before he made amends by converting a penalty after sloppy play from the visitors.
The Kangaroos were clearly under pressure, but it was only a matter of time before Newcastle Knights scrum-half Andrew Johns began performing his party pieces.
It was Great Britain's turn to be put under pressure, and despite the valiant efforts of St Helens' skipper Chris Joynt and Paul Anderson, it was only a matter of time before the Kangaroos broke their opponents' resistance again.
The front-rower found Matthew Gidley, who glided over after the 30-minute mark.
Great Britain showed in the first half that they had the hunger for a fightback, but immediately after the restart, the Australians extended the lead.
Despite Senior's charges, it was the St George Illawarra powerhouse Barrett who put the icing on the cake for Australia with two well-taken tries.
It was a superb contest and Great Britain more than made amends for their lethargic display in Bolton, but it was Australia, once again, who proved that they are the best in the world.
Austin is now the main Championship presenter.
His broadcasting career began in local radio in his hometown Sligo in 1994.
He worked with Eurosport and EuroNews in France before joining the BBC in 2002.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has refused to support him, and referred his nomination to the full Senate without a recommendation.
Mr Bolton has been plagued by charges of bullying and arrogance, which the White House say are unfounded.
A key Republican senator on the panel said he was the wrong man for the job.
George Voinovich still joined the other nine Republicans in sending the nomination forward, but said he would lobby fellow senators on the matter.
"It is my opinion that John Bolton is the poster child of what someone in the diplomatic corps should not be," he said.
On Thursday the panel voted 10-8 along party lines to forward the nomination without endorsing it.
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says it is highly unusual for a committee where the president's party is in the majority to fail to support one of his nominations for office.
A leading Democrat senator, Joe Biden, told the BBC the time had come for Mr Bush to think again about his choice.
Others vowed to keep up their case.
"If this comes to the floor, we're going to have a fight," Senator Barbara Boxer said during the committee meeting.
The White House said it was confident Mr Bolton's nomination would be confirmed by the Senate, where Republicans hold a 55 to 45 majority.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated her belief that he "is the right man for this challenging assignment".
If the White House does not withdraw Mr Bolton's name, the Democrats have two options open to them.
They could try to persuade as many Republicans as possible to oppose Mr Bolton in the full Senate vote and thus embarrass the White House with the closeness of the result.
Or they could try to mount a filibuster, talking the nomination out and forcing the White House to back down.
The BBC's Matt Frei in Washington says that even if Mr Bolton's candidacy is confirmed, so many unpleasant details have emerged during the hearings that he would arrive at the UN as damaged goods.
The committee's vote on Mr Bolton was suspended last month after allegations about his past conduct.
Mr Bolton - a well-known critic of the UN - was accused of bullying junior staff and trying to distort intelligence to fit his own views.
Mr Bush has called Mr Bolton "a blunt guy" who "can get the job done at the United Nations".
Membership of the European Union, which had taken a decade to achieve, was a cause for genuine celebration.
Jiri Pehe, for many years a trusted adviser to Czech President Vaclav Havel, has an explanation.
"It took us so long to be accepted into the club, you made it so hard for us, and now we're wondering what all the fuss was about," he says.
Call it the hangover effect, but there's more to it than a sense of anti-climax.
There is also a serious lack of information and understanding in the new member states about the role of the European Parliament and its elected members.
In the Czech Republic 24 seats are up for grabs, and opinion polls suggest the outcome of the vote will be determined by domestic concerns.
That may not be good news for Vladimir Spidla whose Social Democratic Party is suffering a familiar case of the mid-term blues.
Last week I went to a communist rally in the small Czech town of Jihlava.
Nowadays the communists don't demonise the EU as a capitalist plot, they simply want to "remodel" it for the good of the workers.
Moreover they have a genuine celebrity to pedal their message.
Expect to see cosmonaut-comrade Remek winning a seat in the new European Parliament.
It's just possible that Czechs might vote for an even more outlandish candidate.
She goes by the name of Dolly Buster, which tells you all you need to know about her physical assets and her political insights.
Dolly was a poor Czech girl who made it big in the porn industry.
For years she starred in German sex movies before becoming a producer and the owner of a string of sex shops.
Now she wants a seat in the Brussels assembly, though it's not clear why.
There is though a serious point to be made about the slew of celebrities, odd-balls and misfits standing for election in the new member states.
They, and the parties they represent, have realised that the absence of an informed debate on European issues the best way to rouse interest in this lacklustre campaign season is to provide novelty, human interest.
Some would call it opportunism.
Mr Stastny was once a brilliant ice-hockey player, but he lives in America and has no political experience.
I asked Mr Stastny if he was truly committed to his new career.
"I know how important it is to have a voice in the European Parliament," he told me gravely.
Sceptics might put this down to the probability that no more than one in 10,000 Americans could put a name to the face of EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
But it is also fair to say that the substance of the summit is not going to set the world alight.
But there has been little in the way of progress on climate change, the EU's current obsession, and no grand political decisions have been unveiled.
Despite this, the relationship between Europe and the US appears to be in pretty good shape.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who currently holds the EU presidency, has made the transatlantic relationship a priority.
It is a vigorous rejection of the policy of her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, who appeared to delight in thumbing his nose at the US and cosying up instead to Russia.
This, say the Germans, is why Chancellor Merkel has embarked on an intensive effort to build an economic bridge to the US.
Before, during and in the immediate aftermath of the Iraq war, the relationship between Europe and the US sunk to a previously unknown low.
That discussion did reflect a reality, says John Bruton, the EU's ambassador to the US.
Is the current EU bail-out the right strategy for Greece?
Guns to shoot down Allied fighter planes were placed high on the concrete bastions and hundreds of civilians took shelter inside during bombing raids.
But the architectural historian, Ute Bauer, who is taking part in a study of the towers, says their main purpose was propaganda.
"The towers were meant as a sign of the military strength of the Third Reich, to show that the allied bombers could be defeated.
She says that underground air raid shelters were more effective protection for the civilian population than the landmark towers.
Getting rid of the reinforced concrete hulks would be too difficult and expensive, according to Sandro Forst of the Vienna City Administration.
"Even if you put a bomb inside you couldn't destroy the tower so you would need very strong diamond saws to cut it into pieces," he said.
The towers have few windows and their cold concrete halls and echoing stairwells recall a period in history that some Austrians would prefer to forget.
Calls by Vienna's MAK Museum for Applied Arts/Contemporary Art to turn one of the towers into a centre for modern art have so far failed to materialise.
But now the Vienna City Council is considering plans to turn one of the best-preserved towers, the Leitturm in the Arenberg Park, into a data storage centre.
Sandro Forst says upkeep costs are "rising enormously", and that rent from a commercial storage company would help with the maintenance of the listed buildings.
But Sabine Gretner from the Green Party believes the towers should be opened to the public - as a reminder of a dark period of history.
She says that because of the "Austrian political landscape, it is very important to know about the Second World War".
Speaking in an exclusive BBC interview, conducted at his seat in Istanbul, the patriarch, who is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, also called for an important role for the United Nations in finding a permanent solution to the crisis.
As it draws to a close, he spoke of his hopes and fears now.
The patriarch went on to express the hope that the UN would be able to find what he called the final and peaceful solution of the crisis.
Patriarch Bartholomew has been the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Church since 1991.
He has travelled widely in the Muslim world and has spoken out often for a closer dialogue and understanding between different faiths.
The animal belongs to a general type of dinosaur called a sauropod - which was characterised by a large body, a long neck and a small head.
A PhD student from the University of Portsmouth stumbled upon the specimen while browsing through the shelves of London's Natural History Museum.
The work is to appear in the academic journal Palaeontology.
"It leapt out at me as being different," said Mike Taylor, a computer programmer who is studying sauropod vertebrae as part of his PhD at Portsmouth.
The bone has lain in the Natural History Museum since its discovery in the early 1890s in Ecclesbourne Glen, near Hastings, by fossil collector Philip James Rufford.
It was briefly described by the British palaeontologist Richard Lydekker but was then left untouched for the next 113 years.
Mr Taylor and fellow palaeontologist Dr Darren Naish know the preserved bone came from near the hip area of the dinosaur.
"The difference between this specimen and other sauropod vertebrae is sufficiently great that I concluded that it could not be placed in any existing species or genus," said Mr Taylor.
Knives are even more commonplace, with more than 40% of teachers saying pupils are carrying them, according to the education newspaper SecEd.
Other violent children adopted everyday objects as weapons, such as chairs, cigarette lighters and tables.
Eammon O'Kane, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said "These results are a snapshot of what has become a very worrying trend right across the country.
Staff are becoming increasingly concerned over the prevalence of weapons in the classroom, with 63% of those who took part in the survey saying they are a problem.
Serious attacks have been reported involving bats, bricks, axes, metal bars and even home-made bombs.
The survey also found 28% of teachers had been threatened with violence by a student and 6% by a parent.
Meanwhile, 15% had been physically attacked by a student and 1% by a parent.
SecEd questioned 160 teachers for the survey.
Earlier this year the government announced that the 125 is to be phased out.
But what about those who work aboard the train? Janice Aspinal and Sean Anthony Garrett provide proper meals with wine and real cutlery in the restaurant car.

Last weekend, a 2-2 draw with Burnley saw the Saints booted down to League One, the lowest division they've played in for almost 50 years.
Furious fans stormed the pitch, but not just because of players' poor form.
The Saints have run out of money and if a new owner can't be found by Monday, it looks like game over for the club.
And even if a new owner does come forward, Southampton face starting the new season 10 points behind their League One rivals as a punishment for running out of cash.
Nine-year-old Saints fan Matthew says he'll be gutted if the club shuts down.
"It's not the players fault, it's not the fans' fault, it's just we're suffering from it," he said.
Financial experts have been called in to try to sort out the mess, but fans have also being doing their bit - raising more than £100,000 to help pay the players' wages!
Some of the players are refusing to take a penny until the club's sorted itself out, and sports journalist Simon Carter reckons they've still got a chance of surviving.
"People around the club are fairly confident a buyer will be found," he said.
Atletico took the lead when Sergio Aguero's pass was hammered in by Maxi Rodriguez, before Lisandro had a goal wrongly disallowed by the referee.
He fired in to level soon after, but Atletico went ahead again when Diego Forlan's speculative 25-yard shot somehow went straight through Helton.
But after blazing another chance over, Lisandro tapped in to earn a draw.
The government has said that it is committed to cracking down on tax avoidance in the UK, but should more be done to prevent people from using off-shore tax havens?
Anthony Travers, head of the Cayman Stock Exchange, told the Today programme's Simon Jack that tax avoidance is entirely a function of domestic tax law.
"Tax competition is a function of the sovereign right of a nation," he said, insisting that any Cayman Island companies are "taxed in accordance to United States law".
Nicholas Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands, told Simon Jack that it is terribly difficult for tax a authority like the US to stop haemorrhaging capital to off-shore companies.
"It is nonsense saying that tax heavens are blameless," he said.
The songs, based on polkas and waltzes, feature lyrics backed by accordions and brass bands.
The Mexican Revolution, which lasted from 1910 to 1917, triggered hundreds of corridos about legendary figures such as Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.
But over the past 30 years the biggest growth area has been the narco corridos, which are based on the real lives of drug smugglers.
Corrido performers normally charge thousands of dollars, or tens of thousands of pesos, to write and perform such a piece.
Mr Wald said most narco corrido writers and performers would deny writing bespoke songs for the drug barons.
Corridos, and narco corridos, were now "ubiquitous" in Mexico and had spread to California, Texas, Florida and other places with large Hispanic populations, according to Mr Wald.
They have also become popular in Colombia and in other parts of central America, such as El Salvador.
The Mexican Senate, unable to act itself because of freedom of speech legislation, exhorted individual states to restrict narco corridos, saying the songs "create a virtual justification for drug traffickers".
Since 2001 several Mexican states have negotiated "voluntary" bans with local radio stations in an attempt to keep narco corridos off the airwaves.
But she said the Mexican authorities had often taken action as a way of muffling criticism.
Despite being banned from the airwaves on both sides of the border narco corrido artists continue to sell well, Ms Gonzalez said.
Sarah Palin accuses Obama of associating with 'a domestic terrorist'
She said he had been "palling around" with an ex-member of US-based militant group Weather Underground, which opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s.
Mr Obama once served on a charity board with a member of the group, but he has denounced its activities.
A Democratic spokesman accused the Republicans of gutter politics.
"What's clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy," Hari Sevugan said.
Commentators say Mrs Palin's attack forms part of a broader Republican strategy to attack Mr Obama's character.
Speaking to supporters in Colorado and later in a Los Angeles suburb, Alaska Governor Palin said the time had come to take the gloves off.
Quoting a New York Times article, she attacked Senator Obama over his link to Bill Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, which waged a violent campaign against the Vietnam War.
The group was blamed for a number of bombings in the US in the 1960s.
Mr Obama served on a charity board several years ago with Mr Ayers, who is now a professor at the University of Illinois.
The White House hopeful, who was a child when Weather Underground was active, has denounced Mr Ayers' radical past.
The Alaska governor also said she wished the McCain campaign had not this week pulled out of the battleground state of Michigan, effectively conceding it to the Democrats.
Mr Obama meanwhile attacked the healthcare plans of Republican presidential nominee John McCain.
Speaking to some 18,000 people at a rally in Virginia, Senator Obama described the Arizona senator's policy as "radical" and claimed 20 million people would be left out by it.
A spokesman for Mr McCain, who is in his home state preparing for Tuesday's second presidential debate, said that was "a bald-faced lie".
Healthcare is important to voters and the Obama campaign has unveiled new adverts attacking Mr McCain on the issue in every battleground state.
Mr Obama's Virginia rally came ahead of a Monday deadline for voters to register there and in more than a dozen other states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Florida.
Voter turnout could be vital in deciding the outcome of the 4 November presidential election.
We had a few hundred more sheep a few months ago, but we had to reduce the number because of the drought.
We've had a little rain, so now there's a green cover, but unless there's a lot more to come, it won't make a difference.
We lost about A$1,000 (US$835) for each cow and ended up borrowing A$70,000 (US$58,460) from the bank.
This time round, we collected as much hay as we could, but in February we ran out.
We have probably lost A$150,000 (US$125,271) in revenue this year.
I figured that there's no future in farming for us.
My brother is meanwhile looking to diversify - he is thinking of growing a high-protein crop as well as getting racehorses, which don't need lush pasture.
Where we lived was once in the countryside, but because the city has been expanding, it gradually became a suburban area of Melbourne.
We grew our own vegetables, which we abandoned altogether.
The water tastes foul here in town, and we have water restrictions that mean we can water the garden once a week for two hours and we can't wash the cars.
Temporary warning signs have been put in place on the road from Elgin to Rothes and on a number of minor routes.
Grampian Police have appealed for anyone with information on the incident to come forward.
Farmer Martin Green said someone appeared to have wedged open a gate at Easterton Farm near Elgin, in Moray.
Mr Green, 45, also voiced fears for the safety of any driver who comes across the animals.
"Young calves weigh maybe 50 or 60kg although the stags are probably closer to 70kg.
"If you hit one with your car it would cause very serious damage and because they are red deer they are intensely social and are found in large groups so you wouldn't just hit one of them," he said.
Mr Green, who has been producing venison for four years, said he had not experienced any problems in the past.
"I don't have any enemies in the area, there are no vendettas and there have been no calls from animal rights activists," he said.
He was still attempting to find the calves on Monday.
"They are only 10 months old and they're running around all over the place.

Library chiefs have warned Culture Minister Alun Pugh any attempts to bring it under governmental control would threaten its effectiveness.
They also warned that the library's charitable status could be eroded or destroyed by any change.
The concerns were made in a submission sent to Mr Pugh and seen by BBC Wales.
The warning adds that any change would be costly, time consuming, and could affect the professionalism of its staff.
It also says any move would probably need parliamentary legislation.
The library, set up by Royal Charter in 1907, has the right to receive a free copy of every book published in the United Kingdom.
It has thousands of manuscripts and archives, pictures and photographs, maps, sound recordings and moving images, available for consultation.
There was nobody from the Assembly Government or the National Library to make a comment.
A number of cultural bodies are worried about the situation.
"The library is a statutory body, an organisation with a good record of looking after our literary and archival treasures," said the chair of the Welsh Academy, author Harri Pritchard Jones.
"The assembly does not have a track record.
"But more importantly, I am against totalitarianism where the government takes care of things they know nothing about.
The club has told the Stock Exchange that Everton will receive a guaranteed �23m provided Wayne Rooney remains a United player until 30 June 2007.
Everton could earn an extra �7m over and above the basic �20m transfer fee.
The Toffees will receive cash depending on United's success and Rooney's international appearances over the next five years.
Even if none of those things happen in the next five years the Toffees willreceive at least an extra �3m, paid in �1m instalments on 1 August 2006 and the same date in 2007 and 2008.
Everton have also negotiated a 25% 'sell-on' agreement, under which they wouldreceive a quarter of any excess sum over all amounts paid in this agreement.
When it was introduced at Nagano in 1998, boarders raced against the clock, but the rules were modified in Salt Lake City four years ago to spice things up.
The parallel slalom is one of the most gruelling events at the Games, as competitors have to make it through nine rounds to get to the final.
The event begins with a qualification stage, when riders race on their own against the clock and the top 16 go through to the knockout stage.
Head-to-head rounds involve two races, with the rivals swapping sides after the first race to make sure neither receives an unfair advantage.
The rider who wins both races makes it through to the next round, and the combined times are used to decide the winner if each rider wins one race.
The final two riders in the competition compete for gold and silver, and the beaten semi-finalists face off for bronze.
Like the slalom in skiing, competitors must zig-zag between red and blue gates.
These are shaped on an angle so competitors can lean into the turns.
Flags are placed 20-25m apart and the vertical drop of the course is between 120m and 200m.
If both riders crash in the second heat, the one who passes through the most gates is declared the winner.
Parallel slalom is all about carving, so hard boots and plate bindings are used with a rigid board which can cut through the snow and give a stable and faster ride.
To cut down on air resistance, riders lean into the turns and wear skin-tight suits.
Most wear knee-height shin guards as they often hit the gates as they pass them, and helmets protect the head.
Snowboarding in the UK is possible at a number of venues indoors and out.
It might not be quite the same thing as riding on a mountain but you can snowboard at three indoor slopes in England and at loads of dry ski slopes.
When it comes to the real thing there are loads of resorts to choose from in Europe which are no more than a short flight away.
For more information about snowboarding in the UK, check out the Snowsport GB website.
Pat Sanderson, who led England last summer, has also been left out.
Hill has returned to action after more than a year out with a knee injury but coach Jim Mallinder wants to give the flanker more time to build his fitness.
"I think we have got a good blend of young talent and experience," said Mallinder.
Mallinder said he had left Hill out in order to give him more time to get back to full fitness after his lengthy lay-off.
"Having discussed things with his club, Ashton and I have decided that, for the moment, Richard will stay with Saracens to take some more time to recover," added Mallinder.
The squad features Bristol scrum-half Shaun Perry and Gloucester lock Alex Brown after both were released from the senior Test squad.
And other players have been added to the initial 32-man squad for the match at Exeter Chiefs' Sandy Park Stadium.
Northampton prop Pat Barnard is selected in place of the injured David Wilson, while Leicester's Ollie Smith and Harlequins' Will Skinner also earn call-ups.
Gloucester flanker James Forrester, Leicester winger Tom Varndell and Bath centre Chev Walker were all not considered because of injury.
The 28-year-old Cohen admitted he was unhappy at being dropped from the Test side to the Saxons in Brian Ashton's first squad as England head coach, a decision he found out about from television.

The match had been held over from Saturday because of heavy rain with Djokovic cruising at 7-5 2-0.
When they returned on Sunday he was broken twice as he lost the second set.
A break each saw the third set level at 3-3 and after Youzhny spurned a break point to go 4-3 up, Djokovic claimed the decisive break in the next game.
In addition to it being the first time in his career that Djokovic, the world number two, has successfully defended a title on the ATP tour, it is also his first title of the year.
"It means the whole world to me to defend this title," he said.
"Of course there are always people who are saying he can't do it, he can't do it.
When they returned to the court Youzhny first of all broke back to level at 4-4 in the second set and then, helped by two Djokovic double faults, he put himself into position to serve for the set.
A frustrated Djokovic was warned for racquet abuse at the changeover but his display of temper appeared to help him refocus as he broke back in the following game to level at 5-5.
However, the Djokovic serve once again failed to function and he was broken to love on the back of three unforced errors.
This time Youzhny, who beat Djokovic in the Rotterdam semi-finals two weeks ago, made no mistake, holding his own serve to love to make it one set all.
Djokovic regained the initiative at the start of the deciding set, breaking Youzhny's serve with a big forehand down the line in the second game as he moved into a 3-0 lead.
But once again the Russian dug deep, breaking break back two games later to level at 3-3.
Youzhny had a break point to go 4-3 up, but blasted wide with a cross-court forehand when Djokovic looked to be out of the rally.
The Russian paid the price in the following game when two unforced errors gave Djokovic two break points.
He duly converted the second, when Youzhny hit a forehand long after an energy-sapping rally, before comfortably serving out to take the title.
One of Africa's top Islamic leaders, the powerful Emir of the northern Nigerian state of Kano has told the BBC he is opposed to Osama Bin Laden's version of Jihad against the United States.
The Emir also said he was monitoring US bombing of Afghanistan to ensure that it was aimed solely at what Washington called terrorism, and not Islam in general.
The traditional ruler, speaking through his senior palace councillor during an audience with the BBC, said a Jihad - or holy war - had to follow strict rules.
He implied these rules had not been observed in the attacks on the United States that Bin Laden is accused of masterminding.
His diplomatic balancing act reflects the tensions between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria that have flared since the start of the war in Afghanistan.
Last month, several hundred people, according to unofficial estimates, died in ethnic and religious violence sparked by the US-led air attacks.
The BBC's meeting with the Emir took place at his palace where his arrival was heralded by trumpets.
He sits on a throne surrounded by courtiers, and receives his subjects.
It would be easy to get the impression that life in the royal palace has been changed little by the outside world since the Middle Ages.
But behind the ancient traditions, the issues facing the Emir and the Islamic north of this oil-rich country are complex, pressing, and far from backward.
Western experts on Burma believe the head of its military junta, Than Shwe, removed Prime Minister Khin Nyunt as part of an internal power feud, to forestall any challenge to his own rule.
Burmese pro-democracy campaigners are shocked.
They say the man appointed to be the next prime minister, Soe Win, is a hardliner who master-minded the violent attack last year on pro-democracy leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi.
British officials say the latest moves take Burma another step away from the democratic reforms which the regime has promised.
Many experts fear the new power line-up in Rangoon may spell a new phase of repression in Burma.
Khin Nyunt, who is being accused of corruption, at least paid lip service to the idea that Burma would in time release Aung Sang Suu Kyi from house arrest and return the country to civilian rule.
A statement agreed by all the ASEM leaders said they looked forward to Burma fulfilling its promises of democratic reform as soon as possible.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the European Commission President Romano Prodi were among those who insisted on the benefits of dialogue.
But international human rights advocates, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, criticised the European position.
"The words of protest at Aung Sang Suu Kyi's detention ring hollow when they do not translate into action," he said.
The Burmese delegation was obliged to limit itself to ministerial level at the Hanoi meeting, as a token of European disapproval.
The Hanoi meeting was the first time that government heads from European Union countries had agreed to meet face to face with members of the Burmese junta.
There were harsh exchanges, and just two days later the 25 EU states formally announced they would extend their sanctions on Burma's generals, to ban any new investments in Burmese state-owned firms.
But international critics say those new sanctions are full of loopholes.
French President Jacques Chirac seemed to cast doubt on their effectiveness, saying he hoped the EU's sanctions policy would not damage the operations of the French oil firm Total, which has large investments in Burma.
The EU has promised to increase humanitarian and civilian assistance to Burma, especially in the fields of health and education.
But European diplomats acknowledge their options for influencing events in Burma are running low.
Leaders of Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations) face some more direct and immediate choices.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi said this week that he still hoped Burma's "roadmap to democracy" would not be adversely affected.
But some independent voices in the media and think-tanks of South East Asia now say it is time for Asean to end its policy of non-interference in members' internal affairs, and suspend Burmese membership.
The dilemma was summed up by Bernard Bot, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, which now holds the presidency of the European Union.
Writing about the ASEM summit, he said Europeans should see the relationship with Asia as more than "a zero-sum choice between human rights and trade".
The intransigence of Burma's army generals has made it harder than ever for other countries to support the people of Burma without further diluting their much-publicised "European values", especially regarding human rights.
"It established me as a playwright and an actor," he said.
Over the following 12 months Noel had two comedies, Hay Fever and Fallen Angels, running in London at the same time.
He recovered gradually from nervous exhaustion in Hawaii, coming up with the song A Room With A View.
When his career lagged in the early 1950s, it was there that he developed the cabaret act that revived his fortunes.
He went on to cement several years of critical disfavour against himself in 1961 with a series of dismissive articles in the Sunday Times about the "kitchen-sink" school of realism of John Osborne, Arnold Wesker et al.
The recent revival of his plays, inspired by the 100th anniversary of his birth, casts his work into a greater perspective.
His works are shown to be masterly in their construction.
This was March in a still snowy Albanian village in northern Macedonia and the commander was preparing for a war in the only corner of the former Yugoslavia untouched by the past decade's ethnic conflict.
Today this commander is biding his time in his villa on the Albanian coast after war was averted by a skilful and unprecedented international diplomatic intervention to save Macedonia.
A statement was issued by a previously unheard of Albanian guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army.
"This is not Kosovo," a member of the majority Slav population told me a year ago, summarising ethnic Macedonian resentment both at the Albanians taking up arms and at an international community which, it was angrily claimed, had misunderstood the situation in the republic.
But ethnic Albanians felt they were second class citizens, virtually excluded from the police and army, denied state funding for their university in Tetovo and subject to a constitution which described the country as being the "national state of the Macedonian people".
So although the NLA gunmen were always a minority within a minority, Western diplomats were taken by surprise at the level of support the guerrillas quickly achieved among an Albanian population who believed their aspirations had been too-long denied.
The Macedonian security forces brought out helicopter gun-ships and heavy artillery, pounding rebel-held villages in defiance of international calls for restraint.
The 3,000-strong German Nato garrison stationed nearby ran for cover - there would be no immediate military intervention.
Instead there was a text-book exercise in preventative diplomacy by Nato, the EU and the US.
Over seven gruelling weeks of intensive negotiations in the picturesque setting of a villa on Lake Ohrid, American and European envoys brought the two sides progressively closer together.
Events on the battlefield threatened to derail the whole process several times.
The rebels took the village of Aracinovo, and threatened to rain down mortar bombs on the capital, Skopje, if the security forces did not stop their punishing assault.
Eventually NLA rebels were escorted out of Aracinovo by international troops.
This event and the emerging terms of the peace deal provoked an armed crowd of ethnic Macedonians to go on the rampage, attacking Western embassies, international journalists and even the Macedonian parliament.
Albanian will become an official language along with Macedonian and can be used in official institutions in areas where ethnic Albanians account for at least 20% of the population.
And the constitution is being changed to remove any reference to the ethnic background of Macedonians.
It will now describe all Macedonia's population as "citizens of the Republic of Macedonia".
A respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, says that some 3,000 guns are also in the hands of ethnic Macedonian paramilitaries.
After much delay, the Macedonian Government has finally approved the constitutional changes set out in the peace deal.
Among the ethnic Macedonian parties in the coalition government, the moderate Social Democrats have now pulled out of the government, leaving it in the hands of uncompromising nationalists.
It wants to unify all Albanian lands - so-called Greater Albania - something which will be resisted to the last drop of blood by the ethnic Macedonians.
New images of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison have provoked widespread condemnation across the Arab world, in the United States and Britain.
The photographs, broadcast on an Australian television channel, were taken at the same time as the notorious ones of US soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners in 2004.
Private Lynndie England was jailed for her part in the scandal, along with a number of other American service personnel.
In that context David Sells reports from Germany on how one state has introduced a citizenship test that seems to be weighted against Muslim immigrants.
And grime, if you didn't know, is Britain's answer to US hip hop and it is apparently the next "big thing".
Now grime stars are collaborating with the BBC Concert Orchestra and Steve Smith has had an exclusive preview of the result.

The warning came hours after police in 12 countries arrested around 100 people suspected of running an Internet paedophile ring known as the "Wonderland Club".
Operation Cathedral, co-ordinated from the UK, has so far seized an estimated 100,000 images from videos, CD-Roms, computers and servers.
Detective Superintendant John Stewardson, who led the action for the UK's National Crime Squad, said that the joint action meant that police had finally caught up with paedophiles who use the Net.
Previous raids on Internet porn rings have run into difficulties as forces have been unable to track paedophiles who had covered their tracks.
They can use anonymous e-mail addresses, send messages through re-mailing services which strip them of any identifying features or encrypt material beforesending it.
Crossing national boundaries, material read in the UK can originate overseas and messages between ring members can be sent via foreign service providers.
Last year German authorities founded the world's first team of "cyber cops" to focus directly on Internet pornography.
In July, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for a European strategy to crack down on online porn following the discovery of a suspected Internet child-abuse ring operating out of the Netherlands.
In the same month, UK detectives launched an expert guide to help officers track down hardcore illegal pornography on the Internet and how to discover who is behind it.
Authorities have also put pressure on Internet service providers to deal with the problem by removing any suspect material from their servers.
The UK Government is also backing moves within the European Union to give police a means of accessing encrypted material through a software key.
They say that the need to fight growing computer and Net-based crime outweighs civil liberty arguments.
Police methods for tracking down paedophile rings include posing as paedophiles or young children in online discussion groups to gain access to the inner circle of child pornographers.
They are often tipped off by Customs intercepting porn video tapes.
This year the FBI hired 60 computer experts and is spending $10 million to fight computer sex crime.
While police forces have been investigating the Internet for illegal pornography, many other privately-run organisations have launched their own services aimed at removing material.
The foundation, backed by the UK Government and police forces and Internet service providers, said it had received 781 complaints since it was set up in 1996.
Some have taken matters into their own hands, bombarding those trading child porn with junk e-mail and computer viruses or infiltrating the system and wiping off Websites containing illicit material.
Another fear is that children may become unsuspectingly drawn in by paedophiles using Internet chatlines and many bodies urge parents to prevent their children using these services.
One organisation, Pedowatch - funded and run by volunteers - aims to bring together different criminal justice agencies and journalists investigating paedophilia.
It estimates that around 1,500 people daily use Internet Relay Chat 'Undernet' services to trade child pornography.
Left alone, Hubble, called the most important scientific instrument ever, could only survive another three years.
Astronomers were stunned when Nasa's chief, Sean O'Keefe, decided on 16 January to cancel the fifth, and final, visit of the space shuttle to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
A service call is essential to ensure Hubble's smooth operation until the end of the decade.
The telescope has only three working gyroscopes, down from its complement of six, and cannot afford to lose any more.
Dismayed astronomers understood O'Keefe's logic, but many pointed out that there would now be a gap of several years between the demise of Hubble and its replacement reaching orbit.
They also wondered if there was any way to save the telescope.
In Brazil, Fernando Ribeiro also wondered if Hubble could be saved.
"The HST is such an important, complex, fascinating and cost/benefit effective instrument that it is hard to imagine someone could ever suggest it should be dumped into the ocean, let alone Nasa itself," he told BBC News Online.
Mr Ribeiro first heard about Hubble's demise from the internet.
The petition will be sent to Nasa and US politicians.
Under the plans, the Information Commissioner will be given powers to carry out spot checks - a move previously rejected by ministers.
In the Commons, the PM apologised for the "inconvenience and worries" caused.
Conservative leader David Cameron said the government had "failed in its first duty to protect the public".
The Revenue and Customs data on the two missing discs includes names, dates of birth, bank and address details.
He said he had ordered a review by the Cabinet Secretary of data safety in government and would give Information Commissioner Richard Thomas the power to spot check departments to ensure data is safe.
But Mr Cameron said people would "be angry that the government has failed in its first duty to protect the public".
Mr Cameron said people were "desperately worried" and they would "find it frankly weird" that Mr Brown still wanted to go ahead with plans for a national ID cards scheme and register.
The entire child benefit database was sent via internal mail by a junior official from HMRC in Washington, Tyne and Wear, to the National Audit Office (NAO) in London via courier TNT on 18 October.
Chancellor Alistair Darling said the civil servant had broken the rules by downloading the data to disc and sending it by unrecorded delivery.
Edward Leigh, the Conservative chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the NAO had only asked for basic details about child benefit recipients, without information on personal bank accounts, but was told by "high level" officials that it would be "too burdensome" for HMRC officials to separate out this data.
He said he had been given a copy of a briefing note written by NAO head Sir John Bourn for the chancellor, which suggested that senior HMRC officials authorised the release of sensitive information.
The note says the NAO requested data on child benefit claimants in a "desensitised" form, with bank accounts and other personal data removed, in March, said Mr Leigh.
An email from a senior business manager at HMRC stated that the data would not be desensitised, according to the auditor general's note.
Mr Leigh said the reason given for turning down the NAO request was that desensitising information would require an extra payment to data services provider EDS.
Bosses at the Revenue were not told about the loss of the discs until 8 November, and Mr Darling and Mr Brown learned about the situation on 10 November.
The officials involved waited before informing their superiors in the hope that the discs would be found.
One of the junior officials involved is reported by the London Evening Standard to be in "hiding" in a hotel, with representatives from HMRC.
The Metropolitan Police is leading the search for the discs, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which oversees the HMRC, is investigating the security breach.

New contracts will be offered to loan signing Michael Timlin and full-backs Jamie Vincent and Jack Smith.
The tourists romped into an early lead with tries from Stephen Ferris and Keith Earls, converted by James Hook.
Hook also kicked four penalties but with Ferris sin-binned, Danwell Demas and Wian Du Preez scored for the hosts.
Corne Uys's intercept try from a Shane Williams pass with eight minutes left saw the Lions hanging on desperately.
They might have lost if replacement fly-half Louis Strydom's drop-goal attempt a minute from time had not sailed narrowly wide.
Indeed, if the Cheetahs had been able to match Hook's perfect goal-kicking, they would have been celebrating a famous victory.
After the opening quarter they comprehensively won the battle at the breakdown, where flanker Heinrich Brussow forced numerous turnovers and the Lions suffered for a lack of a specialist open-side.
Two weeks before the first Test in Durban, it was a worrying development for head coach Ian McGeechan and his lieutenants, all the more so after such a promising opening to the match.
Just as on Wednesday in their 74-10 destruction of the Golden Lions, the tourists got off to a flying start, racing into a 20-0 lead by the end of the first quarter.
After an early dust-up sparked by an altercation between Cheetahs prop Du Preez and his opposite number Euan Murray, Hook landed a long-range penalty in the seventh minute.
That settled the Lions and they scored their first try four minutes later, Ferris picking up a loose ball from a ruck and showing superb pace - after his 70m effort on Wednesday - to race to the line.
The second score swiftly followed, Hook hoisting a perfectly weighted chip over the Cheetahs defence that Earls claimed before swerving away from two would-be tacklers.
With the Lions scrum dominant throughout, the stage seemed set for another rout, but a strong run from Cheetahs scrum-half Tewis de Bruyn in the 22nd minute brought a turnaround in fortunes.
Ferris got back to make the tackle, but was sin-binned for staying on the wrong side.
In the 10 minutes the Northern Irishman was off the field, the hosts took full advantage to score two tries and put the outcome in doubt.
First fly-half Jacques-Louis Potgieter sent dreadlocked wing Dumas over at the left corner, before Brussow forced a brilliant turnover and prop Du Preez charged over from close range.
Potgieter converted both to bring the Cheetahs to within six points before a relieving Hook penalty sent the Lions in 23-14 up at half-time.
Potgieter's early penalty on the resumption brought it back to six points, only for Hook to restore the nine-point lead with half an hour left.
That proved to be the last score for the Lions, who thereafter turned over too much ball in contact, with number eight Andy Powell guilty on several occasions.
One superb Ferris break almost sent Earls in for his second before the centre was forced into touch, while another multi-phase attack ended when Earls was turned over a metre short.
But the second half belonged to the Cheetahs, who missed two penalties - one from Potgieter, another from Strydom - before an uninspired Williams tried to force a pass and centre Uys galloped 80m for an intercept try.
Strydom's conversion made it a two-point game for the final eight minutes to give the Lions a major scare.
Centre Luke Fitzgerald hobbled off with cramp with five minutes left to give recent arrival Gordon D'Arcy his first taste of action, while the otherwise solid Lee Byrne appeared to hurt his left hand dropping a high ball in the final minute.
The Lions held on though to survive by the skin of their teeth.
Geronimo Gamez Garcia was detained close to Mexico City.
He is suspected of being the logistics coordinator for a powerful cartel involved in trafficking cocaine from Colombia to the US via Mexico.
The Mexican police say that with this arrest they have dealt an important blow to one of the country's most powerful drug cartels.
They describe Mr Gamez Garcia as the money and logistics man in the Beltran Leyva organisation, with direct responsibility for buying high-quality cocaine from Colombia.
He is known to have frequently travelled to both Colombia and Panama, and believed to have been a personal guarantor for cocaine purchases worth several million dollars.
He was picked up near Mexico City along with eight other people, including at least one Colombian who is understood to have been the Mexican cartel's main contact with their suppliers.
The Mexican government has launched an all-out assault on the drug gangs which operate throughout this country.
One consequence has been an explosion of violence, with the cartels fighting both federal forces and each other as they try to maintain control of lucrative routes.
The helpline, staffed by trained nurses, advises patients who are worried about sudden medical problems.
One of its aims was to pick up people who need urgent treatment, but have not realised the seriousness of the situation.
But it was also hoped that the phoneline would prevent people calling out their GP in the middle of the night, or rushing to accident and emergency with relatively minor problems which do not need immediate attention.
However, a study by researchers at Sheffield University's Medical Care Research Unit suggests that night-time GP callouts and demand for ambulances and casualty treatment has not fallen.
However, Dr Laurence Buckman, a north London GP who has been monitoring the progress of NHS Direct for the British Medical Association, said the jury was still out.
"There are some NHS Direct services that seem to generate a lot of extra work for GPs and hospitals, and there are some which send highly inappropriate referrals.
The government intends to extend NHS Direct to cover the entire country.
The Saudi news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that the ship, identified as the Blue Star Marine, had broken down in international waters and then drifted into Saudi waters off the south western region of Jazan.
The ministry said the rescued Sri Lankans are in good health and being looked after.
Time and again, India has been hit hard by natural disasters and the authorities seem ill prepared to cope.
With the death toll from Friday's earthquake still rising, and survivors complaining of confusion surrounding relief efforts, questions are being raised about India's response to the disaster.
Websites in China have long been required to be officially registered.
The authorities are now determined that blogs should also be brought under state control.
Press advocacy group Reporters without Borders said the initiative would "enable those in power to control online news and information much more effectively".
Private bloggers must register the full identity of the person responsible for the sites, the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry (MII) said.
Commercial publishers and advertisers can face fines of up to one million yuan (�66,000) if they fail to register.
All blogs and websites must be registered by 30 June.
"The internet has profited many people but it also has brought many problems, such as sex, violence and feudal superstitions and other harmful information that has seriously poisoned people's spirits," said a statement on the MII website, explaining why the new rules were necessary.
Blogs are often used in countries where freedom of speech is limited as a way of speaking out against the ruling power.
The new rules could be devastating for bloggers who do not toe the Chinese Communist party line, said Reporters Without Borders.
"Those who continue to publish under their real names on sites hosted in China will either have to avoid political subjects or just relay the Communist Party's propaganda," the organisation said.
"The authorities hope to push the most outspoken online sites to migrate abroad where they will become inaccessible to those inside China because of the Chinese filtering systems," it added.
Known as the Great Firewall, the filtering system used by the Chinese government is not entirely unbreachable; for every new restriction and technical door that it slams shut, the Chinese people find a hack, a workaround or an entirely new way of communicating.
According to official figures, about 75% of sites have already complied with the new procedure.
In May, many bloggers received e-mails telling them to register or face having their blogs declared illegal.
But one anonymous China-based blogger told Reporters Without Borders that when he phoned the MII to register he was told not to bother because "there was no chance of an independent blog getting permission to publish".
In a rhetorical flourish reminiscent of Tony Blair, David Cameron wrapped up his first major speech as Conservative leader.
Although he remained rooted behind a lectern at Manchester's International Convention Centre - not roaming the stage as he had during his leadership bid - Mr Cameron still managed to strike a visionary note as he spoke about trusting people, sharing responsibility and "breaking down the barriers" holding Britain back.
It was as if the Conservatives, having tried calling their members "the nasty party", were now resorting to subliminal advertising in an effort to get them to change their ways.
Mr Cameron mentioned change a total of 27 times during his speech.
One conference session on Friday was even entitled, in a very New Labour turn of phrase, "Be the Change".
Having moved the party closer to Labour in key policy areas such as education, he needs to differentiate it in other ways.
He badly wants the Conservatives to be seen as optimistic and forward-looking, in contrast to a tired, backward-looking Labour Party.
Speaker after speaker said the Tories were the party of hope and optimism, compared to the centralised, bureaucratic, controlling and - crucially - out of date Labour Party.
In addition to change, the words optimism and hope (but not Conservative) were projected on to the conference hall stage.
Mr Cameron also wants the Tories to be seen as the party of the environment, pledging in his keynote speech to deliver a "new green revolution" and taunting his expected rival at the next general election, Gordon Brown, for not talking about the subject enough.
He wants to broaden the party's appeal beyond its traditional base in the suburbs and shires.
Mr Cameron says he is determined to win back power in Britain's cities, where outside London and smaller cities such as Coventry, the party has been largely reduced to a fringe player.
There are no Conservative councillors in Manchester, a city it used to control, and it is a similar story in other northern cities such as Liverpool and Newcastle.
The party knows it is going to be a long, hard slog to claw its way back.
And it is busy damping down expectations of its performance in 4 May's local elections - the first major electoral test of Mr Cameron's leadership.
The problem, and it is one shared by all political parties, is that on a normal blustery Friday afternoon in Sale - without party activists from all around the country pitching in - it would probably have been a different story.
Tory candidate Ralph Ellerton admitted it was sometimes a struggle to motivate the troops.
If they could get just one councillor elected to the city council then it would be a start, he said.
Mr Maude agrees that the Conservatives do not necessarily have to win back support in the inner cities to form the next government.
But, he insists, the Tories want to be a party that represents the whole country and that means the inner cities - areas the Tories say have been abandoned by Labour.
The conference ended on a surreal note with the unexpected arrival of the United Kingdom Independence Party in an armoured car, in the latest round in its ongoing feud with the Tories.
The vehicle represented UKIP "parking its tanks on Mr Cameron's lawn", said UKIP MEP Nigel Farage.
But in a strange way, they might have done Mr Cameron a favour.
As a sign that the Conservatives really are changing, UKIP members in union jack hats - like the ghosts of Tory conferences past - protesting against Mr Cameron's "Blue Labour" party could hardly have worked better.
Whether the Tory leader can take every one of his party's members with him on his journey of change - as he invited them to do in his big conference speech - remains to be seen.
Perthshire MSP John Swinney said the route was one of the most deadly in Scotland with 82 deaths in the last five years.
The former SNP leader said the road was "fundamentally unsafe".
The transport minister said the �600m for a full upgrade was not available and that promise had not been made.
"It promised to have the work finished by the spring of this year and there is not a single piece of construction at this junction started.
Mr Swinney said the change from single road to dual carriageway along the route created "a climate of confusion".
Transport Minister Tavish Scott said he was frustrated that a planned upgrade of the Ballinluig junction had not been completed.
The Scottish Executive has said improvement work on the junction at Ballinluig, near Aberfeldy had been delayed due to poor ground conditions.
Mr Scott conceded the A9 had bad road traffic statistics and said ministers were aware of the public's safety concerns.
The minister said he was "very, very disappointed" that engineering constraints had contributed to the upgrade delay.
Mr Scott said ministers were keen to encourage more commuters to travel to Perth by train rather than car.
He added that other roads in Scotland carried more traffic than the A9 and people would say they, too, needed to be upgraded.
Sue Nicholson, of the RAC Foundation, said motorists could become too easily frustrated on the main road north.
"The biggest problem is probably where it goes from single carriageway to dual carriageway," she said.
Bywater, 24, who began last season as West Ham's first-choice keeper, was loaned out when Roy Carroll and Shaka Hislop joined in the summer.
"We're obviously very disappointed Stephen has been recalled but we have to get on with it," City manager Micky Adams told the club website.
Carroll was one of West Ham's best players in their 2-1 defeat at Manchester City last Sunday, but withdrew from the Northern Ireland squad for their last two World Cup qualifiers because of injury.
Comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner teamed up with the Lightning Seeds to cheer England onto the semi-finals.
Here's a reminder of the lyrics!
Hsu Hai Ching, who died in April aged 93, was known as the "Ultimate Arbitrator" because of his skill in settling gangland disputes.
Members of the island's four major criminal gangs, sporting black shirts and tattoos, joined the procession.
Local media carried reports on Hsu's life, describing his rise from a Taipei market and his ties with politicians.
More than 100 police were deployed for the funeral but gang leaders promised there would be no trouble - calling it a "Peace Day of Gangs".
Taiwanese television said the island's main criminal organisations - Bamboo Union, Pine Union, Four Seas and the Heavenly Way Gang - had taken advantage of the event to show their strength.
Crime bosses from Japan's yakuza, Hong Kong and Macau also attended the funeral, according to news agency AFP.
Hsu is said to have started his illegal activities in a Taipei market and built close links with political figures during his time as a deputy of the Taipei city council.
They are being encouraged to hunt and destroy these toxic pests, which have spread in plague-like numbers across tropical Australia.
The cane toads were introduced from South America 70 years ago in a failed attempt to eradicate cane beetles.
They are big, ugly creatures and their advance has taken them to the outskirts of Darwin.
Residents are being urged to defend the front-line on "Not In My Backyard Day", which is sponsored by the Northern Territory government.
Federal MP Dave Tollner says that the toads deserve no mercy.
"I suggested that people should hit them with golf clubs or cricket bats or, you know, lumps of wood - whatever was at hand.
"You know, to me it seems far easier just to flog them over the head with a lump of wood," he says.
The toads have become a serious hazard to local wildlife.
Crocodiles have died after eating their toxic skin, while lizards have been no match for them either.
Safe to say that cane toads have few friends in Australia's lush tropics.
"I think they're really disgusting and the only fun bit about them is squashing them and killing them," a schoolgirl says.
Australia's RSPCA believes that these warty creatures are a menace and should be destroyed.
It recommends that they be smeared with haemorrhoid cream.
It contains a local anaesthetic that induces a coma.
The toads are then placed in a freezer and the job is done humanely.
President Fidel Castro joined Hemingway family members and US congressman James McGovern to make the announcement at a ceremony on the writer's Havana estate.
Under the agreement, all Hemingway documents will be copied by digitalisation and microfilm and copies stored in the JFK Library in Boston.
The conservation plan includes the restoration of the wooden power boat Hemingway used for deep sea fishing and for occasionally patrolling German submarines among the islands of the Gulf Stream during World War II.
More than 2,000 documents, including manuscript material and letters from Hemingway to his wife, Mary, and son, Gregory, his editor Max Perkins and Adriana Ivancich, the young Italian countess he was in love with, will also be preserved.
The bookshelves at Finca Vigia (Lookout Farm), Hemingway's nine-acre estate in San Francisco de Paula, also hold more than 9,000 books, many annotated in the margins by the Nobel prize-winning novelist.
There are some 3,000 photographs and undeveloped negatives in the house as well as bullfighting paintings, antelope heads from hunting trips to Africa and unfinished bottles of gin, Campari and Bacardi.
The manuscript material found on Hemingway's estate is expected to shed light on the final years of the writer's life.
After Hemingway's death, his widow gave the property and its belongings to the young revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.
Today it is a museum, although the public can only glimpse the interior through the windows.
Cuban curators preserved the home exactly how the Hemingways had left it, looking like the writer had "just stepped down the drive to pick up his mail", according to Jenny Phillips, granddaughter of Hemingway's editor.
US congressman James McGovern helped bring about the agreement between the Cuban Government and members of Hemingway's family.
He said Cuban and American people had been kept apart for too long "by political emnity and rhetoric".
Speaking at the ceremony, which he attended in his trademark green military fatigues, President Castro said he had "many things to be grateful to Hemingway for".
The 76-year-old revealed he had taken For Whom the Bell Tolls into the hills of eastern Cuba with him in his days as a guerrilla fighter.
It was reported on 30 May that Ono watched performance artist Mark McGowan consume a dead dog on London radio station Renaissance FM and tasted what he was eating.
But she was not, as reported in an earlier version of the story, in the studio at the time, having flown to Russia for the opening of her Moscow Biennale show.
McGowan, a vegetarian, said he staged the stunt to protest over the Royal Family's alleged treatment of animals.
A fox was reportedly mistreated during a hunt led by Prince Philip in January, though the RSPCA said it did not suffer.
McGowan described the corgi - which he said had died at a breeding farm - as "really disgusting".
"It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen," he continued.
Viewed "as an art piece", though, he considered his unusual meal "exhilarating".
However, presenter Bob Smith said he was not convinced the meat - reportedly cooked with apple, onion and seasoning - actually came from a dog.
McGowan's previous stunts include leaving a tap running in a gallery to highlight water wastage and using his nose to push a peanut to Downing Street to protest against student debt.
A spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said she approved of his latest shock tactic.
Talking to BBC Radio Four's Desert Island Discs, she said they broke up because she would never have been prepared to give up her career.
Henshall met the prince when she was in West End show Cats and they were together "on and off" for five years.
She is now married to musical performer Tim Howar, and has two children.
Henshall and her former fiance, actor John Gordon Sinclair, attended the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys Jones in 1999 - now the Earl and Countess of Wessex.
She told Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young she had dated the prince "solidly for a couple of years, but on and off for five".
"We couldn't quite let go," she added.
This would usually involved being "smuggled" in in her car because the relationship was not public knowledge.
Despite her feelings she could not see herself becoming part of the Royal family, she said, because she was aware she would not be able to continue her stage career.
"I think I had hopes that we could walk on in our relationship but really and truthfully I think I was very aware that I wouldn't be able to do what I do for a living if I'd have stayed with him.
Henshall said she met the Royal family often and found them to be "lovely".
"When they are behind closed doors they are a family, and they have cook-outs (barbeques) like a family and they talk like a family.
"I never saw the Queen turning sausages (on the barbeque) but I did see Charles," she said.
Henshall has performed in countless West End shows such as Miss Saigon, Les Miserables, Chicago and Oliver!
She met her Canadian husband - who is also part of a rock group called Van Tramp - when they were both cast in Peggy Sue Got Married.
"He blew me away," she said.
During the programme Henshall also talks of the abuse she suffered as a child, and the suicide of one of her three sisters last year.
It is exactly 90 years since the sinking of the mighty Titanic on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.
"Iceberg, right ahead!" cried the lookout Frederick Fleet.
She was a true giant, the most lavish ship of a new generation of passenger liners.
Perhaps ironically it was her sister-ship, the Olympic, which sailed first and received all the kudos for her owners, White Star Line.
Titanic had been travelling at just over 20 knots, when the iceberg scraped along her starboard side.
Captain Edward Smith, known as the "millionaire's captain", was initially told there was no significant damage but an inspection of Titanic's watertight compartments revealed she was in fact in grave danger.
A British inquiry later concluded the disaster was caused by excessive speed.
It was also highly critical of the lack of lifeboats on the ship.
Blame has been laid at the door of many and even today the rows continue.
But it was not until after the oceanographer Dr Robert Ballard discovered the wreck 375 miles southeast of Newfoundland that scientists were able to establish what went so disastrously wrong.
They were able to demonstrate that what appeared to be a relatively harmless tear along adjacent watertight compartments had catastrophic consequences, with the ship unable to cope with the influx of millions of gallons of seawater.
Captain Ron Warwick, who is in charge of luxurious modern-day QE2 and who often sails from Southampton to New York, is part of the exclusive club of people who have dived to the wreck.
He is in no doubt about the legacy of Titanic.
"It tells us we can never be complacent, especially as far as technology is concerned.
Capt Warwick said seafarers the world over have benefited from the Titanic disaster.
An international ice patrol was formed as a direct result of the Titanic tragedy, as well as international laws that require there to be sufficient lifeboats and lifesaving equipment for every passenger.
But could Titanic ever happen again?
As for Titanic, she is deteriorating rapidly.
Anatoly Sagalevitch is head of the Russian research ship Akademik Keldysh which has been forced to sell trips to the wreck to survive and continue its work.
He has probably visited the Titanic more than any one else.
Over the past ten years, he says, much of the ship has been devoured by rusticles.
"Now all the deck is rusting away and there are big holes in Titanic.
Perhaps, when it is time to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Titanic, she will be no more.

The Mamelodi Sundowns player suffered a knee injury in a weekend practice match.
The South Africa Football Association have confirmed he will miss the tournament that kicks off on 14 June and serves as a dress rehearsal for the 2010 World Cup.
A calf injury has already ruled out Orlando Pirates defender Lucas Thwala, while striker Mabhuti Khenyeza from Ajax Cape Town was dropped from the 30-man squad after failing to turn up for a training camp.
Midfielders Thulasizwe Mbuyane from Pirates and Mzuvukile Tom from Golden Arrows were called up as replacements, but Brazilian coach Joel Santana has said the gap left by Moriri would not be filled.
Former South African Footballer of the Year Moriri would have been a strong contender for a place in the starting line-up when South Africa take on Asian champions Iraq in their opening game.
European champions Spain and Oceania champions New Zealand complete Group A.
Group A features South America's best and defending champions Brazil, World Cup winners Italy, African champions Egypt and the United States, who won North and Central America's Gold Cup.
Ancelotti encouraged by confident win
Florent Malouda got the ball rolling with the simplest of headers after some good work down the right by Joe Cole.
And Frank Lampard grabbed the second with a typically pin-point 20-yarder.
Birmingham had only two shots on goal, Petr Cech saving the best from Keith Fahey, and Lampard slammed in a third late on to wrap up a comprehensive win.
The results means the Londoners, thanks in part to rivals Arsenal's failure to beat Aston Villa at Villa Park, return to the top of the table after falling off the number one spot last weekend for the first time in three months.
McLeish deflated after defeat by Chelsea
And with key striker Didier Drogba due to return to the squad this weekend following the Ivory Coast's exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, the Blues' title rivals could not possibly underestimate the challenge Chelsea pose in such apparently irrepressible form.
Not that Chelsea have missed the frontman's presence, as they have scored 17 goals in the four matches they have played without him.
This, too, was a performance full of intent from the hosts, and against one of the most in-form sides in the Premier League.
Had they held out against Carlo Ancelotti's side, Birmingham would have equalled Nottingham Forest's record of of 13 matches unbeaten for a newly-promoted side in the top flight - set in 1994-95 season.
But resisting a Chelsea outfit that has won 31 out of 33 points available at Stamford Bridge this season, including a 7-2 rout of Sunderland last time out, was always going to be a difficult proposition.
And the visitors' task was made all the more difficult by Malouda's early goal.
Joe Cole, in arguably his best performance since his return from a knee injury, created it, beating Lee Bowyer for pace down the right and then crossing to present Malouda with the easiest task of heading home unmarked from six yards out.
Cameron Jerome saw his shot deflected narrowly over the Chelsea crossbar off his strike partner Chucho Benitez at the other end, but the hosts' dominance was otherwise complete.
Joe Cole twice went close with long range efforts, Ballack stung the palms of keeper Joe Hart, and Ricardo Carvalho slammed a header against the post from a Malouda corner as the Londoners toyed with Birmingham at times.
So it was no surprise when Chelsea doubled their lead, Lampard finding plenty of room on the edge of the box, taking a touch, and then slamming precisely into the far corner.
It prompted a slight relaxation in the hosts' approach, allowing Birmingham a rare spell in possession, but Ancelotti's men were back on their mettle at the start of the second half and Ballack, twice, threatened a third.
First he brought a smart stop from Hart with a neat header from Ashley Cole's cross and then his clever flick from Malouda's corner drifted narrowly over.
Birmingham, though, have been nothing if not resolute this season, and twice in a couple of minutes they forged chances out of nothing with the minutes ticking down.
James McFadden should have done better when he dragged wide of Cech's goal from inside the box, before substitute Fahey brought a flying save from the Czech keeper moments later when his toe-poke looked to be heading into the top corner.
It was an admirable, albeit brief, rally from the visitors but it served only in focusing the Chelsea players as they entered the closing stages.
And few could argue that Chelsea did not deserve the third when it came, Lampard striding on to Malouda's pass and firing low past Hart with barely a minute left on the clock.
It means Birmingham stay eighth in the table, though they need feel no shame in succumbing to a superb Chelsea performance.
As for the hosts, an 11th clean sheet of the season only added to a fine night at Stamford Bridge as they march forward in their attempts to win the league title for the first time since 2006.

But the 31-year-old has admitted he would sacrifice a goal for three points against relegation-threatened Boro.
Beattie has netted four times in the three games he has had at his new home ground since signing from Sheffield United in January.
He scored the winner on his home debut against Manchester City and followed that up with a brace against Portsmouth, before scoring the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Bolton.
Stoke's next four fixtures are all against teams in the bottom half of the table.
American golfer John Cook will only mark his ball with coins milled in US states in which he has had success.
Jesper Parnevik, who could fill a book with his superstitions, never marks his ball with the coin "heads" up.
And while Tiger Woods might tell everybody that he wears red on the final day of a tournament because it looks good, the world number one is not so in control of his own fate as to ignore golf's most famous curse.
When Woods tied with Padraig Harrington and Eduardo Romero after the nine regulation holes of last year's Par Three Contest at Augusta, the American took the highly superstitious step of skipping the play-off, leaving Harrington to claim the prize at the third extra hole.
And why did the three-time Masters champion miss the chance of adding his name to the impressive roll of honour that is listed to the right?
Because none of these players went on to win the main event in the same year.
Played on the Wednesday of Masters week ever since its introduction in 1960, the event has become synonymous with sparkling wedge play, light-hearted banter, players letting their kids caddie for them, and, most importantly, the Par Three Curse.
Built in 1958 by designer George Cobb and club co-founder Clifford Roberts, the par-27 course is arranged around two ponds behind the clubhouse.
At just 1,060 yards, the pretty lay-out has given up 55 holes-in-one in the contest's 45 years, with five coming in 2002.
The course record of 20 is shared by Art Wall, in 1965, and Gay Brewer, in 1973.
But what the official records do not tell you, is just how many potential winners have remembered the curse and simply dumped their tee shots at the ninth into Ike's Pond.
David Toms, who won in 2001, later admitted he had considered doing just that.
Harrington took the same gung-ho attitude with destiny in 2004.
You would have thought a player with 26 second-place finishes to his name would have been more circumspect when it came to curses.
It will be interesting to see what Harrington's approach will be this year if he finds himself with a chance of victory on the ninth tee.
My bet is that his approach will be dumped in Ike's Pond.
England Women's Rugby captain Catherine Spencer tells BBC Points West that fitting in rugby around her job is tough but worth it.
The 26-year-old conflict between the two claimants to the Western Sahara - Morocco and the Polisario independence movement - has entered a new phase with the announcement in the last week of June of a new draft United Nations peace plan.
The plan - drawn up by the UN secretary-general's special envoy to Western Sahara, former US Secretary of State James Baker - draws back from the traditional UN position that the issue be resolved by a referendum of the territory's inhabitants.
In exchange, the Moroccan Government would allow the Sahrawi residents of the region a measure of autonomy, particularly on economic and social issues.
Over four years, democratic institutions would be put in place that would allow the Sahrawis to exercise self-determination.
The dispute over Western Sahara stems from the early 20th Century when rival European powers colonised different parts of North Africa.
This conflicted with a rival claim by Mauritania as well as the goals of the indigenous Polisario separatist movement.
Backed by Algeria - Morocco's regional rival - Polisario was able to mount an effective guerrilla war against Morocco over two decades.
Because of an effective diplomatic campaign led by Algeria, Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara has never been internationally recognised.
As part of a ceasefire agreement in 1991, both sides agreed to resolve the issue by referendum but since that time, they have failed to agree on who should be eligible to vote.
In the meantime, over 150,000 Sahrawi refugees have remained in camps waiting to go home for the last 26 years.
The Western Sahara issue has dragged on for so many years largely due to the resolute and at times stubborn attitudes of both sides preventing a compromise being found.
This has been exacerbated at times by the governments of either Algeria or Morocco using the fervour surrounding the Sahara issue to bolster public support for their regimes.
Of late, Western countries have warmed to a perceived greater political openness in Morocco since the accession of the new king, Mohammed VI.
Polisario remains heavily dependant on the support of the Algerian administration.
Algeria continues to be dogged by factionalism and uncertainty, and strong military factions regularly block initiatives that might bring an end to this key source of regional tension on which the Algeria military justifies its powerful position in the government.
The Bush administration is on the defensive after it was revealed that it was warned of plans to hijack US airliners more than a month before the attacks of 11 September.
Democrats and some members of Mr Bush's own party are calling for the administration to reveal what was known and when.
And one intelligence expert said the Bush administration should be more open and co-operate fully with the congressional inquiries, or it risks losing public support.
Although Mr Bush believes the controversy is politically motivated, he cannot ignore the outrage expressed by families of the victims.
Stephen Push's wife of 21 years, Lisa Raines, died when the plane she was on hit the Pentagon.
The Bush administration stepped up damage control efforts on Thursday with a rare public briefing by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice.
However, she defended the president, saying that the threats were general and that most focused on targets outside the US.
"If this president had known something more specific - that a plane would have been used as a missile - he would have acted on it," Ms Rice insisted.
Counter-terrorism expert Thomas Badey says that the Bush administration would have been hard pressed to piece together the disparate bits of information they had in order to prevent the attacks of 11 September.
"Ninety percent of intelligence failures are not failures to collect information but failures to put it together properly," Mr Badey said.
The failure of US intelligence to predict and prevent the attacks of 11 September was simply a failure to make sense of the bits of information collected by various, and often isolated, US agencies.
Mr Badey is not surprised that the controversy began immediately after the Republican National Committee launched a fund-raising campaign showing President Bush as a central figure in the fight against terrorism.
But he sees this as part of a larger trend that has politicised the fight against terrorism.
From political fund-raising to the storage of nuclear waste in Nevada, terrorism is being used to support one cause or idea over another, he said.
And he fears that such politicisation might interfere with reforms designed to streamline US intelligence efforts.
Both investigations fought an uphill battle to wrest information from the CIA and other intelligence agencies.
The mass tournament in the Zocalo beat the previous record of 12,388, set last year in the nearby Mexican city of Pachuca.
A city official said that 13,446 players had taken part.
Alongside thousands of amateurs were hundreds of grandmasters, including Russian champion Anatoly Karpov.
The grandmaster, who was a world champion for 16 years between the 1970s and the 1990s, played 25 games with local children during his visit to Mexico.
The claimed record has not yet been certified by representatives of Guinness World Records.
A BBC correspondent said that the players dressed in green and white and played at colour co-ordinated tables, so that from the air the entire square took on the appearance of a giant chessboard.
Most of the participants were Mexicans, including toddlers and grandfathers as well as national chess champions.
Huge screens in the plaza beamed a message announcing that the record had been broken.
Mr Maliki is reportedly close to finalising the line-up, five days ahead of a constitutional deadline.
Shias, Sunni Arabs and Kurds have been in dispute over the make-up of the unity government since elections in December, causing a power vacuum.
Deputies say the powerful defence and interior portfolios are still undecided and may be put under the PM's control.
"The composition of the government may be announced without naming the defence and interior ministry posts," Hassan al-Sunaid MP said in an interview with AFP.
Naqsha Bibi, 40, was recovered alive from the debris of a collapsed house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir on 10 December.
The unexpected rescue came more than two months after the 8 October earthquake destroyed large parts of Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir and northern areas in Pakistan.
Naqsha Bibi, now under hospital treatment, is suffering from muscle stiffness and is so weak that she can barely talk.
She weighs under 35kg - about half the weight of an average woman her size.
But since being brought to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, she has been put on a liquid diet and is showing signs of recovery.
Doctors say that on Tuesday morning she gave them a smile.
"We were not even looking for her," says Faiz Din, her cousin who found her.
Naqsha Bibi and her family are residents of the Kamsar refugee camp some six kilometres from Muzaffarabad.
The camp was set up in 1990 for people from Indian-controlled Kashmir trapped on this side when borders were closed amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India.
Her family included a brother and their father - their mother had died before they entered Pakistan-administered territory.
Faiz Din says both her father's legs were broken in the earthquake and he was flown to Islamabad aboard a rescue helicopter within a week after the quake.
Her brother went with their father as an attendant.
"At that time, we thought Naqsha had either fallen down the hill or gone to live in some relief camp in the city," says Faiz Din.
Part of the hill that houses the Kamsar camp had collapsed into the river below.
Anyone who was not found immediately was thought to have fallen with the crumbling hillside and died.
"Frankly, we were all so busy taking care of our own families that no one was thinking of the house next door," Faiz Din says.
It seems that Naqsha was trapped in her kitchen when her small house collapsed around her.
The space where she was found was not even big enough for her to stretch her arms or legs.
Over the 63 days that she spent in this grave of sorts - her muscles frozen in a crouching position.
Even on the hospital bed now, she maintains her embryonic position and doctors say she will need extensive physiotherapy to return to her normal self again.
What remains a mystery - at least till Naqsha Bibi is able to tell her story - is how she managed to survive for so long.
Faiz Din says there were some traces of food, most of it rotting, in the kitchen when he found her.
The air in the tiny space was fresh, which implies that some airway must have remained open through the debris.
And there was a trickle of water on one side of the kitchen, probably from one of several tiny streams that dot the Kamsar area.
"We started clearing the debris of her house on 10 December, mainly to pull the iron sheets off the collapsed roof to build ourselves a shelter," says Faiz Din.
Naqsha's nightmare, however, was not immediately over.
"We first thought she was dead but she opened her eyes as we were pulling her out," says Faiz.
Naqsha was unable to respond to repeated offerings of food and water.
Apparently, her condition convinced her rescuers that she was on the verge of death.
That was why Faiz Din didn't take her to a doctor immediately despite being so close to Muzaffarabad.
"We thought she was going to die any moment," he says.
Two days later when a team of German doctors visited the Kamsar camp, they were told about Naqsha Bibi.
They contacted the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) who sent Dr Hafeezur Rehman to bring Naqsha to Muzaffarabad.
At Muzaffarabad's PIMA medical camp, Naqsha was examined by a Danish doctor of Pakistani origin, Mariam Bashir.
"She seemed to be physically stable but in shock," Dr Bashir told the BBC.
The first challenge for the doctors was to feed her.
Starting intravenously, they moved within hours to a liquid diet and were greatly encouraged by her body's response to nutrition.
On 13 December, a psychiatrist spent three hours with her checking her responses and said she was able to understand most of his requests.
But she was still unable to carry out even simple tasks such as sticking out her tongue or speaking.
PIMA now plans to bring in a physiotherapist to help revive her limbs which are still stiff.
Most of the doctors are now convinced that given the right treatment Naqsha may be able to lead a normal life once again.
Dr Abdul Hamid was one of the doctors treating Naqsha.
The government is preparing new legislation after considering a report from the Gaming Review Body, which recommended deregulation.
But bingo club owners fear a shake-up could threaten their future and are further warning that bingo would be used to tempt punters into "problem gambling".
The Gaming Review Body, chaired by the former Treasury economist Sir Alan Budd, also proposed all-night betting with alcohol and live entertainment.
It also advocated ending restrictions which force people to apply for membership of bingo halls and casinos 24 hours before they can play.
They were already under pressure from high taxes and competition from the National Lottery and scratchcards, he said.
He disputed the report's conclusion that bingo club numbers would not be affected.
Sir Peter also warned that bingo players may be alienated by theharder gaming atmosphere.
And repercussions for bingo clubs could affect the Exchequer.
The Department of Culture, Media and Sport said it could not comment on the claims before the White Paper was published.
Dee Haines, 49, died from a kidney tumour on Saturday 5 February at home with her family in Congresbury.
Her husband Phil rang the out-of-hours GP service at 1530 GMT but an agency doctor did not arrive until 2115 GMT.
North Somerset NHS Trust, which is responsible for the out-of-hours service, has since apologised to the family for the delay.
But Danielle Robb, one of Dee's daughters said it should not have happened.
"That Saturday was the busiest the service had experienced and we brought in another doctor to help.
When the out-of-hours service began in November 2004, the Primary Care Trust said it would have to use an agency to supply doctors for the area because there was "insufficient interest from local GPs to provide the home visiting service".
But it said local doctors were now expressing an interest and it hopes to have a predominantly local GP-led home visiting service by April.

Following in the footsteps of his mum, Princess Diana, Harry has visited hospital patients, Aids victims, homeless people, orphans, young offenders and worked on schemes to improve people's health in poorer countries.
On his 18th birthday, he asked for the money made from the sale of his birthday photos to go to charity.
The charity called Merlin is not well-known, but they help save millions of people affected by wars and disease in countries like Africa and Afghanistan.
Carson, 21, was at Charlton on a similar deal last season and has also been a target for Manchester City.
His exit was delayed while Liverpool found a replacement.
But Itandje, 24, has now completed his move to Anfield and is eligible to face Toulouse in Liverpool's Champions League qualifier on 15 August.
Carson, who is second choice to Pepe Reina at Anfield, will not be allowed to leave the club permanently but Reds boss Rafa Benitez is happy to loan him out for a second successive season to give him regular matches.
If Carson does move to Villa he would be ineligible to play for them against the Reds on Saturday.
Villa turned their attention to the England Under-21 international after Sunderland beat them to the signature of Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon on Wednesday.
Carson joined Liverpool from Leeds for �750,000 in January 2005 and was one of Charlton's more respectable performers last season when the Addicks were relegated last season.
He went to the Under-21 European Championship with England during the summer, where his side lost to Holland on penalties at the semi-final stage.
The Manchester United striker, 25, was banned for two matches by the Football Association and must sit out Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City.
Rooney also thinks his team-mate Ryan Giggs should be knighted, and laughed off a storm over a split with sponsors.
"Of course, it was wrong of me to do.
Rooney - who was superb in the two European matches against Chelsea which fell either side of the Fulham Premier League game he missed through suspension - also admits being bewildered at the fuss created by a parting of the ways with former sponsors Coca-Cola.
Press speculation claimed he was dropped after the swearing incident, but England international Rooney says they ended their relationship last year.
"I spoke with Coke towards the end of last season about signing a new deal and, with the Olympics coming up, they wanted a bit more of my time to do more commercial appearances," he said.
"I just didn't have the time to do it.
After he and Ryan Giggs inspired United to victory against domestic rivals Chelsea in Europe's elite club competition, Rooney hailed his Welsh team-mate as one of the greatest players in the club's history - and believes it is only a matter of time before he is knighted.
"He is just incredible," he said.
Rooney also praised fellow United veteran Paul Scholes, now 36.
"Scholes is the best footballer who I have ever played with," he said.
Walliams, 34, will be aiming to raise funds for BBC Sport Relief on his epic 21-mile Super Swim.
David will brave freezing waters for up to 16 hours, dodge tankers and plough through seaweed on his aquatic adventure.
But he needs your help and sponsorship to keep him afloat - so please go to his website to pledge your support.
"It's terrifying, utterly terrifying - six people have died doing it, so yes I am a little bit worried," he admitted.
"It was kind of my idea but I hadn't really thought how hard it was - you can't touch the boat, you can't touch anyone else, you can't even wear a wet suit.
David has teamed up with Greg Whyte from the English Institute of Sport to oversee his training schedule.
"The English Channel is the blue ribbon event of endurance swimming and represents one of the toughest physical challenges on the planet," said Whyte.
"David has been working tirelessly over the past 11 months to make an attempt on the channel.
Even so less than 10% of people who have attempted the challenge have succeeded in reaching France.
So David will need as much of your support as he can get.
Should companies themselves, or their advisers, or the authorities be blamed for aggressive tax avoidance?
Mary Monfries, head of tax at PwC, told Today presenter Evan Davis that tax advice given by her firm "cannot be based on any misinterpretation or non-disclosure of the facts".
But Richard Murphy, adviser to the Tax Justice Network, said that there will not be full disclosure in many tax havens "because there is no tax authority to declare it to".
There were 11,445,638 eligible voters - and every one of them voted for the president, according to Izzat Ibrahim, Vice-Chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council.
Saddam Hussein - who has ruled Iraq since 1979 - was the only candidate.
Voters had been urged to show their support for the Iraqi leader in defiance of the demands for military action against him from the US and Britain.
During polling, many voters trampled American flags and some signed their ballot-papers in their own blood in a display of loyalty to their leader.
"Obviously it's not a very serious day, not a very serious vote and nobody places any credibility on it," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Tuesday.
But Mr Ibrahim said Iraq's elections should not be compared to elections in Europe or America.
Iraq was in a situation comparable to the early history of Arab states, he said - in Iraq there is one destiny for the whole country.
If the Americans did attack, Iraq had taken precautions to defeat them, Mr Ibrahim said.
We're going to fight them in every village and every house - even the shepherd will have a role in the battle, he said.
Tuesday's 12-hour-long voting was technically a secret ballot but few people bothered with the curtained booths - if only because they feared a "no" vote could be traced back to them.
Polling stations were bedecked with posters of Saddam, and biscuits and drinks were served as children performed patriotic songs.
Some of the few words of opposition to be heard on polling day came from the semi-autonomous Kurdish regions in the north.
The BBC's Caroline Hawley, reporting from Baghdad, says that despite the festive air during polling, the Iraqi regime is well aware that the Americans are determined not to allow Saddam to serve the new term he is assured.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell met UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the continuing wrangle over a new United Nations resolution on Iraq's alleged remaining weapons of mass destruction.
Washington has threatened to take unilateral action against Saddam if the UN fails to find a solution.
A spokesman for the International Mission for Iraqi Elections conceded that there had been minor problems, but said the vote had generally gone well.
About 11m Iraqis were estimated to have voted, a turnout of about 70%, with results due in two weeks or more.
President Bush is to make an address on the situation in Iraq on Sunday night.
"We are now entering a critical period for our mission inIraq, the president will talk about what we have accomplishedand where we're headed," said his spokesman, annoucing the rare address from the Oval Office, to be made at 2100 on Sunday (0200GMT Monday).
"The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq is to be commended on the way it has performed its role under the difficult circumstances prevailing in Iraq," said Paul Dacey, spokesman for the international observers.
The country's electoral commission announced on Friday that 320,000 Iraqis living abroad voted in the election.
Around 15 million Iraqis were eligible to vote for the country's first full-term government since Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003.
The vote will elect 275 members of a national parliament, who will in turn appoint a president.
Voting was extended in many parts as Sunni Arabs took part after boycotting previous elections.
Election officials reported high turnouts even in Sunni insurgent strongholds such as Falluja and Ramadi.
US President George W Bush described the vote as "historic", and appeared delighted with the high turn out.
Sunni nationalist insurgent groups had urged people to vote to prevent the election of a government dominated by Shias and Kurds.

Robert Brown, a 52-year-old accountant, had been seeking a High Court order to unseal both wills.
But Sir Mark Potter, the president of the Family Division, ruled the claim should be struck out as "vexatious".
Sir Mark said Mr Brown's bid was made "solely for the purpose of seeking to establish an imaginary and baseless claim.
In a statement, Mr Brown said that he would apply for permission to appeal.
"My intention had never been to embarrass the Queen or other members of the Royal Family and I had long sought a response to my questions in private.
Frank Hinks QC, representing the executors of both estates, had previously argued that Mr Brown's claim was "scandalous" and founded on "an insane delusion".
However, Geoffrey Robertson QC, representing Mr Brown, said his client was "a perfectly rational man who seeks peace of mind".
Princess Margaret died in 2002 aged 71.
Mr Brown believes he is her son and 12th in line to the throne.
Although he was born on 5 January 1955 in Nairobi, Kenya, his birth was not registered until 2 February and the birth certificate gives the date of 4 June 1955.
His parents are registered as Cynthia and Douglas Brown.
Cynthia Brown was a model who worked for Hardy Amies - a favoured designer of the princess.
Research carried out by Mr Brown has convinced him the princess was forced to give up her "secret" son and he claims a mystery Privy Council meeting on the day he was born will back up his claim.
The wills of senior royals have been officially sealed since 1911.
Mr Brown claimed a public right to unseal both wills, having earlier failed to establish any private right to do so.

Random Acts of Art at Spacex in Exeter features the work of three artists in residence who have been working with members of the local community.
The week-long exhibition takes place on 24 April to 1 May 2010.
And in a one-off event, archive photographs will show what life used to be like in this part of Exeter.
The three artists have produced contrasting elements to depict life in the West Quarter.
Lady Lucy is a portrait artist based in London, but she studied fine art in Exeter; film-maker Volkhardt Mueller was born in Germany and now lives in Exeter; and London-based Amy Feneck has written a theatrical monologue using stories she has collected from members of the local community.
"Lady Lucy constructed a mobile portrait cart and she has been out and about in people's gardens on the estate in Mermaid Court, Wheatley Court and Neptune Court.
"She has been inviting people to sit with her for half an hour in conversation, and at the same time she does their portrait.
Lucy is aiming to showcase 30 portraits at the exhibition and on the final day, the 'sitters' can collect their pictures at an end-of-exhibition tea party.
Volkhardt Mueller has been collecting people's memories of the Fore Street area and the result is a highly unusual view of the city.
"Lots of people spoke to him about their memories of the carnival which used to take place in Fore Street," explained Martha.
Amy Feneck has built up her connections with Exeter during her two month residency and is using the independent spirit of the West Quarter as her inspiration.
"In her work, Amy has has interviewed characters who illustrate that independent spirit, for example members of CND.
During the week, a series of other related events are also being staged at Spacex - including a presentation of archive images of the West Quarter.
The event at 7pm on 27 April is staged by Exeter historian Peter Thomas, who manages the photos in the Isca Historical Photographic Collection which stores some 60,000 images.
"For many Exonians the area referred to as the West Quarter has a special importance and affection," said Peter.
"During my talk I will give a unique visual insight into the history of the area, evoking memories of the city that are very different from what we see today.
You can see a selection by viewing our photo gallery.

Celtic's Paul Lambert passed a fitness test on his ankle to take his place in the starting line-up.
Chris Sutton also returned to the team after recovering from injury but Stephen Crainey missed out through injury.
Maurice Ross was named in the Rangers team, with Fernando Ricksen set to play in midfield.
Manager Alex McLeish took the expected gamble on Ronald de Boer, who has recovered from a broken toe.
But there was no place in the starting line-up for Andrei Kanchelskis, Christian Nerlinger and Tore Andre Flo.
Ronaldo was accused of helping to get England's Wayne Rooney, his United team-mate, sent-off in the World Cup quarter-final.
He scored twice in the 4-1 win over Oxford but was booed every time he touched the ball by the home fans.
"It was Cristiano's first game back and I thought he handled it very well," said Ferguson.
Ronaldo's first goal against Oxford came when curled in a superb 14th minute volley after striker Louis Saha's cushioned lay-off.
He rifled a 20-yard shot into the bottom corner after David Jones had provided the short pass for his second before being substituted.
United's fans gave him rapturous applause as he left the field but Oxford's fans showed little sympathy as they jeered him off.
He is likely to get some similarly hostile treatment at Premiership venues but did not appear concerned by the abuse.
He also set up striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for United's opener with Darren Fletcher scoring the third for the Old Trafford side.
Robert Duffy scored Oxford's goal to make it 3-1 before Ronaldo had the last word.
Ferguson had several of his international stars back for the game and Saha and Mikael Silvestre completed the full 90 minutes while Gabriel Heinze lasted just short of an hour.
"It was important to get the remaining World Cup players back into the game," said Ferguson.
Sir Alex Ferguson had previously lost six important shoot-outs
"When Cristiano Ronaldo missed his penalty we thought we were in trouble but we deserved the win.
The triumph gives Ferguson his second Champions League crown, to go with the 10th Premier League title his side clinched on 11 May.
Manchester United took the lead through Ronaldo on 26 minutes but Frank Lampard equalised just before the break.
It went down to penalties, with John Terry missing the chance to win it for Chelsea before Edwin van der Sar saved Nicolas Anelka's spot-kick to take the trophy.
"It gave them an impetus because I thought they were the better team in the second half, they had more power than us.
Ronaldo had put United ahead with a pin-point header - his 42nd goal of the season.
The Portuguese star admitted he felt he had cost his side victory when Petr Cech saved his penalty but Terry hit the post for Avram Grant's side and Van der Sar made the decisive save from Anelka.
Van der Sar won Europe's leading tournament for the second time following victory with Ajax in 1995, although he lost on penalties with the Dutch club the following year.
"We got a little bit lucky with the slip from John Terry, otherwise it would have been all over," stated the keeper.
And Van der Sar said he had not been surprised to see centre-back Terry step up for the potentially decisive spot-kick.
"You don't necessarily have to be a striker to take a good penalty," he said.
The victory was also a milestone for United winger Ryan Giggs, who came on in the closing minutes of normal time to surpass Sir Bobby Charlton's appearance record for the club.
"I want nights like this again," revealed Giggs, who played his 759th game for United in the dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea.
Ferguson confirmed that both Giggs and Paul Scholes will be involved next season.
We have the issue of Scholes and Giggs getting to the twilight of their careers," he said.
"Ryan will be 35 in November; I think he'll play until he's 37, with maybe 25 to 30 games a season.
In the 2003 Masters, that point came as the shadows began to lengthen at Augusta National and leader Len Mattiace stepped up to the final tee.
Three holes further back Mike Weir, in the final pairing, was embarking on the 15th hole, two shots behind Mattiace.
The result was a two-shot swing which helped set up a play-off - and gave Weir the momentum to take his first Major title.
Having struggled to save par at the previous hole, Weir drives his tee shot left at the par-five 15th.
He is only just off the fairway but has a clump of trees between him and the green.
He takes an eight iron to make sure he clears the branches and lays up 100 yards from the pin in a perfect position to attack the green.
The Canadian then takes a lofted club and the ball stops dead several feet from the pin, giving him a good chance of a birdie.
There is still some work to do, but Weir's putting has been rock-solid all day and he bravely nails a six-footer to pick up another shot.
Weir acknowledges the crowd's cheers and strides off to the 16th with the look of a man who knows his time for Masters glory may have come.
His line to the green is obscured and he is forced to chip out with a six iron sideways on to the fairway.
His third lands beyond the pin and ends up on the fringe of the green.
The American then nervously underhits his par putt and finds himself with a nasty six-footer for a bogey.
He sets his putt off left of the hole and it looks as if it might roll past, but at the last moment it edges right and topples in via the back of the cup.
Mattiace clenches his fist in relief but the damage is done - his dropped shot combined with Weir's birdie means there has been a two-shot swing and a play-off beckons.
Cardiff suffered an early setback when Nicky Robinson was forced off following a hefty challenge by Kelly Brown.
Mark McMillan darted over from close range in the 26th minute and Max Evans scored two tries, the first arriving just before half-time.
Winger Lome Fa'atau added a third try after the break and Evans' second arrived in the dying seconds.
Sean Lineen's side were in control throughout and bagged a bonus point to step up their title charge.
Glasgow earned the first scoring chance of the match by pressuring Cardiff into conceding an early penalty.
But the anticipation of the fans turned to frustration as Dan Parks' effort slid wide of the target.
Most of the action was confined to midfield as the sides probed in the hope of finding an early opening.
Robinson's night came to an early end after Brown put him under pressure with a forceful challenge.
Parks was first on the scoresheet with a penalty in the 24th minute and it was a sign of more to come for the hosts as they created a try two minutes later, scrum-half McMillan darting over from close range.
A turnover paved the way for Glasgow to set up another opportunity just before the interval.
Hooker Dougie Hall was blocked just a stride short of the line and seconds later new Scotland cap Evans raced through after a patient recycle.
Parks was wide with the conversion but made amends eight minutes after the restart with his second penalty following a spell of intense pressure.
That was the spark for Glasgow to snatch a brilliant third score by winger Fa'atau.
He finished in style following a chip from Andy Henderson and a slick feed by Brown.
Thom Evans should have snatched the bonus-point try, but his lob was just too strong and the ball dribbled out of play.
However, brother Max completed the job to round off a perfect evening for the Warriors.

And the March on Washington, which took place on 28 August, 1963, may be the apogee of the civil rights movement which transformed the lives of black Americans.
But it would take another president, and another year, before a major civil rights bill moved through Congress, then dominated by white southern Democrats.
And it would take another decade before black people would be able to acquire real political power in the South.
But, by then, the civil rights movement had fragmented amid violence and recriminations on all sides.
The momentum behind the March on Washington had been building for several years as the pace of civil rights activism increased following the Supreme Court decision in 1954 which outlawed segregation in public schools.
In 1956, Dr King had led the Montgomery bus boycott which had led to desegregation of the public transport system.
In 1960, young black college students across the South began a series of lunch counter sit-downs to force local stores to serve black people.
The dramatic confrontations in April - with white police chief "Bull" Connor turning fire hoses on young demonstrators - brought the civil rights movement to national attention.
But President John F Kennedy was still reluctant to alienate southern white voters by pushing too hard for civil rights legislation.
So the leaders of six major civil rights organisations - including the NAACP, which advocated a legal strategy, and SCLC, agreed to stage a mass demonstration in Washington.
Afraid that violence would derail their cause, they recruited 4,000 volunteers to keep order.
President Abraham Lincoln had freed the slaves, and previously black singer Marian Anderson had sung from its steps - at the behest of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt - when she had been denied admission to Washington concert halls.
But the size of the turnout - and its inter-racial nature - exceeded all expectations.
Among the speakers were white trade union leader Walter Reuther and white religious leaders like Rabbi Joachim Prinz.
But the sense of progress felt that summer by the civil rights movement was soon to be challenged.
Less than a month later, four black schoolgirls were killed by a bomb placed in a Birmingham church by a white supremacist.
And in three months, President Kennedy was dead, assassinated in Dallas, Texas.
His successor, Lyndon Johnson, a white southerner, eventually proved the best friend the civil rights movement ever had.
And it was not until 1965 - and another summer of confrontation at Selma, Alabama - that the Voting Rights Act gave political power to southern blacks.
By then unity that had characterised the early civil rights movement had also come under severe strain.
Some of the students who had united behind Dr King developed their own organisation - the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) - into a vehicle for black power which opposed Dr King's approach.
White trade unionists became alienated from the black civil rights movement over demands for local community control of schools and teacher hiring, especially in a bitter strike in New York City.
And starting in 1966, a series of riots convulsed northern cities like Los Angeles, Newark, and Detroit, as black people expressed frustration over the slow pace of change in the North.
Eventually, Dr King himself turned North to engage in the struggle for economic justice and opposition to the war in Vietnam before being assassinated in 1968.
By that time, the civil rights movement had transformed the political and social landscape of America for good.
Forty years after the March on Washington, in June this year, the US Supreme Court upheld one of its key achievements - the idea of affirmative action to increase the representation of minority students at elite universities.
For decades, Sweden maintained that the DC-3 plane and its eight-man crew had been intercepted by the Soviets during a training flight on 13 June 1952, while Moscow insisted that it had nothing to do with the plane.
Only in the late 1980s, the former USSR confirmed that the plane - which Sweden finally admitted was on a spying mission - was shot down by a Soviet fighter.
This was later confirmed by Swedish military authorities.
"We are missing only one DC-3, and if you find a DC-3 with Swedish Air Force symbols in this area, you can be sure it is the right one," Swedish Armed Forces commander-in-chief Johan Hederstedt told Reuters news agency.
The explorers declined to release the exact location of the wreckage.
They only said that it was found in international waters near Gotska Sandoen island, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) east of the Swedish coastline.
"I cried," said historian Carl Douglas, describing the moment when the plane's hull emerged from the sand about 100 metres under the sea surface.
The explorers spent three years combing about 700 square kilometres (270 square miles) of the sea floor looking for the plane.
The twin-engine plane - nicknamed Flying Hut for its slow speed - was an easy target for Soviet Mig fighters.
Despite initial denials, Sweden later admitted that the plane - equipped with British surveillance gear - had been spying on the then new Soviet radar stations in the former Baltic republics.
Moscow only admitted shooting down the plane shortly before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Senior Soviet military officials visited Sweden and apologised to relatives of the crew.
The Swedish authorities have said they would examine the site and decide whether to salvage the wreckage.
The districts have been divided into four judicial zones, each having two judges and a permanent court address.
The Taleban have up until now used mobile courts - with no permanent offices or judges - to settle criminal and financial disputes.
They say the permanent courts show the diminishing authority of the central and local governments.
The Taleban currently control large areas of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) along the border with Afghanistan.
"There will be eight judges, two for each zonal court, and there will be a top judge to whom appeals can be made," Dr Asad, a spokesman for the Mohmand Taleban, told the BBC News website.
An official of the Mohmand tribal administration confirmed the report, saying the courts were already functioning a day after the Taleban's announcement.
Meanwhile, the top spokesman for the Pakistani Taleban Movement (PTM), Maulvi Omar, has told the BBC Urdu service that permanent Taleban courts were already functioning in Bajaur district, Mohmand's northern neighbour.
"About 20 local religious scholars issue dozens of judgements each day in Bajaur, where we have the most organised judicial system in place," he said.
In addition the PTM also runs a vast network of mobile courts in the rest of the Fata areas, he said.
The cases range from land transactions and loan disputes to family matters.
All this is embarrassing for the Pakistani government, especially because the Taleban have in the past carried out cruel punishments against people accused of moral turpitude, crime or spying.
Earlier this month, two Afghan nationals accused of spying for the US were publicly killed on the orders of a Taleban court in Bajaur.
Last month, a court in Orakzai ordered the public killing of half a dozen alleged bandits.
And in March, the Taleban killed a couple after they were allegedly found guilty of adultery by a court in Mohmand.
Meanwhile, Pakistani troops are engaged in a week-long face off with militants in the Hangu district of NWFP, on the border with Orakzai tribal region.
Neil and Christine Hamilton were a formidable parliamentary partnership.
In their final months together at Westminster before the 1997 general election and Mr Hamilton's defeat in the Tatton constituency, they seemed to be inseparable.
The sight of the two of them, striding determinedly through the corridors of the Palace of Westminster, is something no political correspondent will forget.
As the storm clouds gathered, amid the swirling allegations of sleaze which clouded the final months of John Major's government, Christine, who was her husband's secretary and parliamentary assistant, was always at Neil's side.
Any journalist who dared approach him with a challenging question was only too aware of Mrs Hamilton's commanding presence and her ability to see off reporters who went too far.
It was at the battle of Knutsford Heath that I first saw the hint of fear in their faces.
Despite the pressure on him to stand down, Mr Hamilton was determined to seek re-election as Tatton's conservative MP but Labour's spin doctors knew just how to twist the knife and keep allegations of sleaze at the top of the political agenda.
The morning after Mr Bell's arrival, the Hamiltons arrived unannounced on the heath opposite his hotel.
If Mrs Hamilton thought that with her piercing eyes and glaring looks that she could frighten off the battle hardened war reporter, she was mistaken.
Although the Hamiltons stood their ground and denied the allegations against them it was obvious that one of the safest Tory seats in the country was about to slip out of their hands.
Labour were taking no chances and their candidate was persuaded to stand down leaving a clear field for Mr Bell.
Labour had even lined up an alternative independent, John Stalker, the former deputy chief constable of Manchester Police, to fight the seat on anti-sleaze ticket should Mr Bell back down.
As the election campaign proceeded, the Hamiltons had to retreat to their constituency home, the Old Rectory in Nether Alderley, and it was there that the media established their camp.
I will always remember the great aplomb with which Christine handled the reporters, photographers and television crews giving us strict instruction on where to stand.
Occasionally we were all allowed up the drive for a carefully controlled photo-opportunity where Mr Hamilton delivered a well-thought through soundbite.
For some reason Tory wives, unlike their Labour or Liberal Democrat counterparts, can often become highly-effective political operators.
There is no doubt that without her consistent and loyal support Mr Hamilton might never have fought on for so long, picked himself up after his disastrous parliamentary defeat and then battled on through the courts.
A No 10 spokesman said James Purnell and Geoff Hoon acted within the letter and spirit of the law while Mr Brown again gave his backing to Hazel Blears.
Ms Blears repaid £13,000 in tax despite not apparently breaking any rules.
One Labour MP has said he will stand down over expenses claims while a second has offered to do the same.
Dr Ian Gibson, the Labour MP for Norwich North, has also said he will stand down if his constituents think his conduct over his second home allowance went "one step too far".
He faces allegations in Friday's Daily Telegraph, which has obtained details of all MPs expenses, that while he was claiming for his second home in London, his partner and her daughter were living there rent-free.
The paper also says he subsequently sold it to them for less than he bought it and well below the market value.
Dr Gibson has insisted he acted within the rules and "made nothing on the house whatsoever".
Three Conservatives, Anthony Steen, Douglas Hogg and Sir Peter Viggers, have also announced their intention to step down after they were criticised for their expenses claims.
Cabinet ministers continue to come under scrutiny with Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell accused of not paying capital gains tax (CGT) on his designated "second home" - and claiming expenses for "tax advice" on the sale.
The Telegraph also said Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon sold a property on which he did not claim expenses but designated his main home for CGT purposes, when he had been living in a "grace and favour" flat and renting it out.
Both said they were not liable for CGT and had had their claims checked over by accountants and Revenue and Customs.
Mr Brown, who has said Hazel Blears's failure to pay CGT on her second home was "totally unacceptable", said he did not believe Mr Purnell or Mr Hoon should repay any money.
Ms Blears repaid £13,332 in respect of capital gains tax on the sale of a flat she had designated her "second home" for expenses purposes.
She also said she had never broken any rules - guidance to MPs states that their "second home" can still be designated as their "principal residence" to HM Revenue and Customs for capital gains tax.
But she said she had been hurt by reaction to the story in her Salford constituency and said she wanted to try to rebuild trust.
Mr Brown said her behaviour had been "unacceptable" but she had repaid the money and retained his full confidence as communities secretary.
BBC political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue said it was difficult to see what Ms Blears had done differently from Mr Purnell and Mr Hoon, and Downing Street was not offering a "straightforward answer".
Under tax rules, sellers can claim a property is a main residence for CGT purposes, as long as they lived there less than three years before the sale.
Mr Purnell's spokesman said the allegations against the minister were "completely untrue" as he had bought his constituency home at a time he was trying to sell his London flat.
"The sale of his London flat fell through, but it was sold within the period that HM Revenue and Customs continue to treat it as not being liable for CGT," he said.
He said he now rents his "second home" so would not make any capital gains on it and had double checked with HMRC, which had confirmed he was not liable.
Among other MPs coming under scrutiny, the Telegraph said Tory MP Peter Luff claimed for £17,000 on furnishings over four years, including nearly £1,000 for two separate china sets as well as a request for a £1,583 dining room table which was rejected.
Mr Luff told the newspaper he believed he had acted within the "letter and spirit of the rules" but would repay any money if his judgement was proved to be wrong.
Meanwhile there have been some concerns that cabinet ministers are not being punished to the same extent as backbenchers.
MPs Elliot Morley and David Chaytor have been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party after questions were raised about their claims.
Peter Kenyon, a member of Labour's ruling national executive committee, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One he had received "numerous representations" on the issue.
"The perception out there in the CLPs (constituency Labour parties) is that government members are being treated differently from backbenchers," he said.

The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the season, starts in Melbourne on 19 January.
General Motors is to sell its European operations to Canadian firm, Magna, prompting fears for GM's Vauxhall factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port.
Germany has offered Magna loans, but Lord Mandelson told the BBC there must be no link between aid and saved jobs.
Separately, Belgium wants the EU to probe Germany's role in the Opel sale.
Opel's factory in Antwerp is almost certain to close, GM has admitted, as the new buyers look to slash overheads.
Regulators had to look carefully at the sale to ensure that state aid rules were not being broken, Lord Mandelson said.
"European governments and the commission will want to drill down into the business plans and the financial contributions by the various governments to see that European state aid rules in this Magna-GM deal are being respected.
Lord Mandelson has been upbeat about the future of the UK Vauxhall plants - although last week he acknowledged there were likely to be job losses.
Magna said it would honour existing contracts at Luton until 2013, but has not given any commitment beyond this point.
The Luton plant has a contract to build Vivaro vans as part of a deal with Renault, but the French carmaker has a clause allowing it to pull out of the contract if there is a change of ownership.
Some observers have criticised the UK government, arguing that it has been outmanoeuvred by its German counterpart, because Berlin has received specific commitments about safeguarding German jobs.
Magna has said it will not close any plants in Germany.
It is provided by a range of different organisations, including local authorities, the NHS and private and voluntary organisations.
Most people have no idea how the complex web works and prefer to turn a blind eye until they come face to face with it when they or a relative needs help.
They may not then be in the best position to make a decision on what to do.
This is a guide to how the system currently works.
Home care services include meals on wheels, respite care, community nursing and day care centres.
Local authorities provide 60% of publicly-funded home care help, compared with the NHS which funds the rest.
Private and voluntary organisations can be contracted by local authorities to provide support, such as meals on wheels services and respite care, on their behalf.
NHS care, which includes home adaptations and community nursing services such as chiropody, are free.
Local authorities can charge for services and are increasingly doing so because of budget cutbacks.
Since April 1993, social services have increasingly being targeting the most frail, providing more services for fewer people.
According to the King's Fund, 75% of home care is now provided to people over 75.
Local authorities also provide grants for hom adaptations and aids.
Carers, who are relatives or friends, also provide support to people living at home on a voluntary basis.
The government has recently published the first National Carers' Strategy which includes extra funding for respite care to give carers a break.
There has been a big fall in the number of places in local authority residential care homes since the introduction of legislation to encourage them to contract services to private and voluntary sector homes.
In 1984, there were 137,200 local authority places, but by 1998 there were just 64,100.
Local authorities must first assess elderly people's care needs to see if they qualify for a place in a residential care home.
The cost of care homes varies across the country.
Under means-testing, residents with more than �16,000 in capital must pay the full costs of care home places.
People with between �10,000 and �16,000 get some help from the state to pay for their care.
Those with under �10,000 get the maximum state support, but are still expected to use their savings to pay towards some of their care.
Local authorities currently support 200,000 residents.
In 1997, the NHS is estimated to have paid for 15,000 places at nursing homes.
There is no charge to the patient, but state benefits are gradually reduced.
The NHS also funds some services, such as continence supplies, to people receiving means-tested care in residential and nursing homes.
Places in private and voluntary care homes have risen since the 1980s.
But the number of people in private homes has fallen since 1993 when community care reforms were introduced.
Charities for the elderly say the system is complex and does not promote older people's right to live as independently as possible.
They want a simpler set-up which does away with regional variations and power struggles between different agencies.
The Royal Commission on Long-Term Care for the Elderly, which has received evidence from a vast array of organisations over the last year, recommended in March that all personal and nursing care be provided free.
This argument is also the subject of a test case at the Court of Appeal.
Pamela Coughlan says her health authority should not be able to close her NHS care home and move her to a home where she has to pay for her care costs.
The government has yet to respond to the Commission's recommendation, but is acting as an expert adviser against Ms Coughlan.
Witnesses said the gunman went into the library at the Mercaz Harav seminary in the city's Kiryat Moshe quarter and opened fire.
The assailant, who Israeli police said was a resident of East Jerusalem, was shot dead by an Israeli army officer.
The attack is the worst of its kind in Israel for a number of years.
The White House has led international condemnation but the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called the attack "heroic" while not claiming responsibility.
However, the 15-strong UN Security Council failed to agree on a resolution condemning the attack because of reservations from temporary member Libya, which sought to link it to Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip.
A previously unknown group called the "Jalil Freedom Battalions - the Martyrs of Imad Mughniyeh and Gaza" claims to have carried it out, according to Lebanese Hezbollah media.
The fact that the school is at the heart of the settler movement in the occupied West Bank may have been the reason why it was targeted, BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports.
Many of its students are on special courses that combine religious study with service in combat units in the Israeli army, he notes.
There will be an Israeli response to this attack, our Middle East editor adds - the question is how severe it will be.
The gunman entered the library at the Mercaz Harav seminary on Thursday evening, where about 80 students were gathered, and fired an AK-47 rifle for several minutes, witnesses say.
One of the students, Yitzhak Dadon, reportedly shot the gunman twice before he was finally killed by an off-duty Israeli army officer, who had gone to the school after hearing gunfire.
"I shot him twice in the head," he told the Reuters news agency.
Another man told the BBC that there had been "terrible scenes" inside the building afterwards.
Jerusalem police commander Aharon Franco confirmed there had been only one gunman and said he had hidden his weapon in a cardboard box.
Imad Mughniyeh, a senior Hezbollah leader and military commander, was killed in a car bomb in Damascus on 12 February.
An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said that "terrorists [were] trying to destroy the chances of peace" but peace talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas would continue.
Mr Abbas condemned the attack in a statement saying he "condemns all attacks that target civilians, whether they are Palestinian or Israeli".
US President George W Bush condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms" and UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said news of the killings was "shocking".
"They are an arrow aimed at the heart of the peace process so recently revived," Mr Miliband added.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also criticised the "deliberate killing and injuring of civilians" in what he called a "savage attack".
In the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, gunmen fired into the air after news broke about the attack.
Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the group "blesses the heroic operation in Jerusalem" calling it as a "natural reaction" to Israeli attacks.
Last week, Israeli forces launched a raid into northern Gaza in which more than 120 Palestinians - including many civilians - were killed.
Shortly after the Jerusalem shooting, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said four of its fighters had been killed in an Israeli air strike in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis.
Israel says the recent military offensive has been designed to stamp out frequent rocket fire by Palestinian militants.
Rocket attacks have hit deeper into southern Israel, reaching Ashkelon, the closest large city to the Gaza Strip.
Moments later, it seems to be struck by a super-hot outburst of gas from the star.
This spectacular image was spotted on Tuesday by a spacecraft, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (Soho).
The joint European Space Agency/Nasa satellite is designed to give warnings of stormy space weather that might affect the Earth.
Soho has photographed hundreds of comets around the Sun but this one, known as Neat, has only just been seen.
It has been hovering in the evening sky for the past few weeks but is hardly visible without a telescope.
The comet, which goes by the official name C/2002 V1, is new to astronomers.
Scientists are studying its interaction with the solar wind - the hot, charged particles flowing from the Sun.
They hope it could reveal new information about what comets are made of.
During the 11-day mission, astronauts made three spacewalks, installing solar panels on the space station.
The panels - which weigh 17 metric tons and span more than 70m - will eventually supply the station with a quarter of its electrical power.
The shuttle is expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.
It pulled away from the space station more than two hours later.
After undocking, the Atlantis team planned to circle around the station to check its overall condition and beam images back to Earth.
The Atlantis astronauts leave behind the station's current three-member crew, who have been living there since March.
Construction of the station was halted three years ago, after the Columbia shuttle disintegrated during its return to earth, killing seven astronauts.
The agency now says it expects construction to be completed in 2010, the same year it plans to retire the ageing shuttle fleet.

Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise.
In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset.
Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.
The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched.
The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked.
The first call was made from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house.
Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about �2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.
This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on.
He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million.
Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone.
Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.
Psychologists asked people to sort a set of 60 statements, each offering a different view of love.
The team, from Nottingham Trent University and University College London, said it was then able to identify nine varieties of love.
Their definitions from the nine types include Cupid's arrow, hedonistic love and love as ultimate connection and profound feeling.
"The evidence suggests, however, that love is historically and culturally variable.
He added the research found that expectations of love and relationships were not being satisfied.
"Our study highlights some of those expectations, such as the heavy burden of responsibility we often place on our partners to make our lives better," said Dr Watts.
Fifty people took part in the survey.
Researchers said the most dominant view was that love should be based upon mutual trust, recognition and support.
Britain has its first full coalition government for 70 years after David Cameron was confirmed as Prime Minister of a Tory-Liberal Democrat leadership.
Gordon Brown announced his immediate resignation on Tuesday evening and David Cameron arrived at Downing Street as prime minister just 90 minutes later.
Shortly after midnight, the Liberal Democrats gave their approval to the coalition deal.

Olympics chief Jacques Rogge emphasised athletes had to be "clean" in order for them to receive an upgrade.
Greek Thanou was banned for two years after failing to appear for a drugs test at the 2004 Athens Olympics.
"Potential upgrades will be scrutinised - we have to be sure they are clean," said IOC president Rogge.
Jones caused a sensation in October when she handed back the medals she won in Sydney after admitting taking steroids to a New York court.
The American, who was the first woman ever to claim five medals at a single Olympics, won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x400m relay in Sydney.
She also won bronze medals in the long jump and 4x100m relay.
Jamaica's Tanya Lawrence took the bronze medal in the 100m in Sydney behind Jones and Thanou.
Lawrence's compatriot Merlene Ottey was fourth in the race and is now in line for a medal.
Pauline Davis-Thompson is set to swap her silver medal for a gold having finished second to Jones in the 200m.
Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka and Jamaican Beverly McDonald finished third and fourth respectively.
Meanwhile, Rogge added that the IOC would wait on recommendations from the world athletics body (IAAF) before deciding whether to strip Jones' relay team-mates of their gold medals.
Decisions on upgrades are set to be made in December.
Officials entered 25 facilities associated with the cult looking for illegal activities by members.
Shoko Asahara was convicted in 2004 of masterminding a 1995 gas attack on the Tokyo subway in which 12 people died and hundreds were injured.
The cult changed its name to Aleph in 2000 and has renounced violence.
But it is still heavily monitored by police.
Security officials said they wanted to check for any unexpected reaction to the Supreme Court's decision.
"Our aim is to prevent any illegal activities by cult members in response to the confirmation of Asahara's death sentence," an agency official told Reuters news agency.
The cult leader, a former acupuncturist, was sentenced to death in February 2004 after a trial lasting eight years.
He was also found guilty of other charges including plotting a 1994 gas attack in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto that killed seven people.
Altogether, 12 cult members have been sentenced to death, but none of the sentences have yet been carried out.
Japan does not announce the dates of executions and they could happen at any time.
Last month, a court upheld the death sentence for the cult's alleged second in command, a chemist who oversaw the development of the nerve gas.
Before the attacks, Aum Shinrikyo had thousands of members, many of them educated and wealthy, who embraced Asahara's violent apocalyptic teachings.
In its new form as Aleph, it still considers Asahara a "genius of meditation" but says it cannot approve of Aum's activities under his leadership and no longer considers him its guru.
Gabriele Sandri, 26, was shot in what police called a "tragic error" as they tried to stop violence between rival fans at a motorway stop in Tuscany.
Later hundreds of fans rampaged in Rome and there were more protests in Milan.
Police chiefs, politicians and football administrators will be meeting on Monday to seek to limit the damage from the weekend's incidents.
The worst violence was in the capital, where hundreds of armed fans attacked a police barracks and the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters.
Sunday's late match between AS Roma and Cagliari had been postponed as a precaution but fans wielding rocks and clubs turned up outside the Stadio Olimpico.
Security guards in the Olympic headquarters barricaded themselves in as fans outside smashed windows and burned vehicles as they clashed with police.
The mob blocked off one end of a bridge over the Tiber and ordered motorists to leave the area.
A bus was torched and several people including police were injured.
There were also angry scenes in central Milan near the offices of the broadcaster RAI, as fans hurled rocks at a police station and beat up two journalists.
In Bergamo, where Atalanta were playing AC Milan, police and fans clashed ahead of the match.
The game was abandoned 10 minutes after kick-off, when fans tried to smash down a barrier and force their way onto the pitch.
In Siena, supporters shouted "murderers" at police.
There was also violence at lower league games in southern Italy.
Seven of the top league games started 10 minutes late with players wearing black armbands although atmospheres remained tense.
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi called for a full investigation into the shooting and said the violence was "very worrying".
Mr Sandri, a 26-year-old disc jockey from Rome, was a Lazio fan on his way to a match with Inter Milan.
Lazio fans and supporters of Juventus on their way to a match at Parma reportedly clashed at the service station near Arezzo.
Mr Sandri was apparently shot while in a car outside the motorway restaurant.
Police suggested he may have been killed by a warning shot.
The exact details of the shooting are unclear and an investigation is under way.
"It was a tragic error," said Arezzo police chief Vincenzo Giacobbe.
"Our agent had intervened to prevent the brawl between these two groups, who had not been identified as fans," Mr Giacobbe said, according to the Italian news agency Ansa.
The Inter-Lazio game was postponed.
In April the Italian government introduced a law aimed at stamping out football hooliganism.
It was enacted after a policeman was killed in rioting at a match in Sicily in February.
The BBC's Frances Kennedy in Rome says that despite the new anti-hooliganism measures, Sunday's explosion of anger shows that violence is never far from the surface.

The 33-year-old, who announced his departure from the Spanish giants on Monday, had hinted he could make a move to a Premier League side in England.
But on Wednesday he signed a two-year deal with Schalke, who finished second in the Bundesliga last season.
"We have signed an exceptional footballer and world-class goalscorer," said Schalke coach Felix Magath.
Schalke had a gap to fill in its attack after Kevin Kuranyi left for Dynamo Moscow at the end of last season.
Raul scored 323 goals in 741 games for Real, and 44 goals in 102 Spain games.
That scoring ratio helped him become a legend at the Bernabeu club, which he joined in 1992 - making his first-team debut against Real Zaragoza in October 1994 at the age of 17.
And his record meant the likes of Tottenham, Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester United were mentioned as possible destinations for the veteran forward.
Raul helped Real seal three Champions League triumphs and six Spanish league titles in his time at the club.
After being presented as a Schalke player on Wednesday, he described the Bundesliga as the world's best.
The striker also stated that it took only one conversation with Real manager Jose Mourinho, who took over in May, to convince him to leave.
"From that moment on my mind was made up to look for a new challenge with Schalke," he told the German club's website.
"An era has ended with Real Madrid but a new one has begun with Schalke.
Midfielder Guti, 33, who spent a total of 25 years with Real having come through their youth system, announced he was joining Turkish club Beskitas on Sunday.
The pair were officially unveiled at a media conference at Pittodrie on Wednesday lunchtime.
The current Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager and his assistant's move to Pittodrie had been Scottish football's worst-kept secret in recent days.
After 48 hours of negotiations between all of the parties concerned, a compensation deal was agreed between the Dons and Caley Thistle, which includes a friendly between the sides.
Dons chairman Stewart Milne said he was delighted to be welcoming "one of Scotland's brightest young managerial talents" to the club.
Paterson admitted that it had been a wrench to leave Caley Thistle but said the move represented a chance to prove himself at a higher level.
"To me Aberdeen is Scotland's third largest club and to have the chance to manage them is a huge opportunity," he added.
Shearer, a hero as a player at the club, also said he had found it impossible to turn down the opportunity on offer.
Caretaker manager Gardner Speirs and coach Drew Jarvie will be leaving Aberdeen, following Ebbe Skovdahl out the door.
Gordon Dalziel at Ayr and Livingston coach John Robertson are other names being linked with the Highlanders.
First-team affairs will be handled by director of football Graeme Bennett and coach John Docherty in the short term.
The club had hoped to persuade Shearer to stay on to take over from Paterson once it became clear that the manager was on his way to Pittodrie.
Caley Thistle released a statement on Wednesday thanking Paterson and Shearer for the commitment they had shown the club.
The statement stated that the club had an idea of the type of man they wanted to replace Paterson and invited applications from people with managerial experience.

The coverage of the war in Libya has decreased in recent weeks, but fighting goes on with civilians still in danger.
Alastair Leithead reports from the town of Sirte, where the violence is continuing.
More than 30 people are now known to have died in several eastern states and emergency workers are warning that the death toll is almost certain to rise.
Dozens of people are missing in Ohio, Tennessee and Alabama, hundreds are injured and tens of thousands of homes are without power.
Unseasonably high temperatures followed by a cold front generated the conditions for the tornadoes which came in several violent waves.
One of the worst-hit communities was Mossy Grove in Tennessee where seven people died when a tornado wrecked everything on the ground in a swath five to six miles (6 to 10 kilometres) long.
One of the victims was a four-month-old boy, killed in an area where 20 homes were flattened.
More than 40 people were missing in Mossy Grove, with emergency crews working through the night having to rely on ham radio operators for communication since phone lines were knocked out by the storm.
Several people died as they became trapped in cars and homes, while others frantically tried to escape the churning storms.
In Ohio, a State Highway Patrol trooper, Jon Cross, said he saw a storm approach as he was heading to work.
The storms cut a 100-mile (160-km) swath through northwest Ohio farmland, doing serious damage to the town of Van Wert.
Deaths have been reported in Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Mississippi.
BBC One's rival The Saturday Show had just 800,000 viewers in comparison.
Mariah Carey, Robbie Williams and a host of stars appeared as the duo made a tearful goodbye to the show which ended the BBC's dominance of Saturday mornings.
Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly will now concentrate on prime-time shows, such as ITV1's current Pop Idol.
On Saturday's show stars such as U2, David Beckham and Sir Paul McCartney were seen giving their memories of the pair, whose shows have revitalised Saturday morning viewing and consistently beaten BBC One.
In Chums, Mariah Carey starred as co-presenter Cat Deeley's maid of honour as she finally "married" Dec.
But she then looked amused and slightly bewildered as the marriage broke down 30 seconds later and the priest, played by Skinner, began to do a striptease.
Ant and Dec began their careers as child actors PJ and Duncan on BBC children's drama Byker Grove, and went on to have chart hits with songs including Let's Get Ready To Rumble and Shout before moving on to presenting.
The success of the show led to the demise of BBC One's Live and Kicking, which was axed during last summer after eight years on air.
The programme makers promised a show that was "fresh and funky".
Ant and Dec's first stab at a later time-slot on ITV was Slap Bang, which suffered disappointing ratings, although ITV has commissioned a second series of the show.
Ant and Dec have now been lined up to host a new show on ITV1 from next year, but details have not been revealed.
Newly-unearthed film of the singer will be projected across moving 3D panels to create a 30ft tall virtual Sinatra.
The show, at the Radio City Music Hall, is opening almost a week late due to technical problems.
The show uses 17 projectors and 11 screens, as well as banks of computers.
"In a large Broadway or West End show you would have some 80 or 90 "automated moves" and in this show we have close to 200," Mr McAnuff said.
Sinatra, one of the most famous singers in America, died in 1998 after a long illness.
The footage in the new show includes 35mm film - shot in the 1950s - from the Sinatra family vaults, which has never been seen before.
The show is the latest tribute to an artists still revered as an American icon.
But not all are happy with the way Sinatra is being brought back to life.
"It's sort of like turning Sinatra into a Walt Disney show," said Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis.
But I think what's happening over time is as people know more about these proposals, they realise the weaknesses, that they realise the costs, and they decide that they're not a good idea and they're too much of an incursion of their civil liberties.
Remember, the Prime Minister in his moving comments the other day said, we will not be intimidated, we will not allow the terrorists to change our way of life and that's something very important to remember throughout this whole exercise, this very emotional and difficult time.
Now does the balance change in that comment as a result of what has happened? Do you start to think again about what he did?
And we made this argument at the time - look, if you're going to do this, the Home Secretary was countenancing I think dozens, tens or dozens of people possibly being under these constraints or control orders.
They can be equally quick and at the end of the day, when there was a judge making the decision you take much less risk of as I say creating not martyrs but creating recruiting sergeants for the sort of radicals that - the sort of extremists that we're trying to defeat in this battle.
The Home Secretary was not, never countenancing putting thousands of people under control orders, he said that in the House of Commons.
Was it just convenience that they appeared then disappeared in the run up to an Election?" So you're suggesting the government was crying wolf on the whole thing?
In fact the number of control orders exercised, the people from Belmarsh have been, have been put under a control order and a few others, two or three others now.
But it has certainly moved the debate on and that I think is a very signal achievement of all of the G8 leaders.
So I don't accept that you know, this is all one way traffic here and the relationship between ourselves and the United States and I think if anything, you know, those people who are objective and fair minded, looking at what came out of the G8, would have to say that you know, it was a sensible set of agreements.
It shows that there is significant value and strength and depth in that relationship that we have across the Atlantic, and we should do everything to maintain and sustain that.
They want to see a determination to track these vicious criminals down, and in the process make sure that the things that are important to us as a country, the values that we hold dear - our unity, our belief in democracy and fair play, that we don't lose sight of those things and I think when that bomb, when those bombs went off on Thursday, I think that was the response that most people in this country were looking for and I think they got it.

After years of civil war, the country may still be male-orientated, but women constitute more than half the potential voters and head more than a quarter of the households in Cambodia.
But until now they have not had much of a political voice.
Pok Nanda is Executive Director of Women for Prosperity - a non-government group that campaigns to get more women into positions of influence.
She says that these are the first elections in which women's votes will really count.
Among the changes women are demanding are equal opportunities in the workplace, better protection of their children, and steps to prevent prostitution.
"I want our Cambodian women to have freedom," said one woman.
Perhaps in recognition of the increased political mobility of women, many parties pledged to ensure that 30% of candidates were women.
But several new parties headed by women are hoping to change that.
Cambodian-American Doug Sokhoeun is a candidate for the Khmer Snake Lady Party.
"I want women to know that there is a least one woman who will represent them, who will talk about their legal rights as merchants, civilians, and farmers," she said.
But the vice president of the women's wing of the royalist Funcinpec party, Mu Sochua, says that it is still culturally unacceptable for women to go far in politics.
Even the most energetic campaigners admit there is still a long way to gobefore women achieve parity with men in politics.
But that does not stop thempushing for better representation and demanding that issues affecting women are placed high on the political agenda.
The General Secretary of the TUC, Brendan Barber, has announced that postal strikes planned for Friday and Monday have been called off.
He said the decision had been made to provide "a period of calm" in which the two sides could reach a long-term deal.
The CIPD found that only one in five companies planned to hire 16-year-olds due to leave school.
The Prince's Trust fears the poorest youngsters will be particularly badly affected by the recession.
It says young people in deprived areas will be hardest hit as unemployment rises and local youth services become vulnerable to cuts.
The trust says youth charities may be unable to keep up with demand, as their services face spiralling demands from disadvantaged young people.
Graduates and school-leavers will undoubtedly have to work harder to get themselves into employment this year.
Adam Hale, chairman of the technology leadership group at the Prince's Trust, says job-seekers must be distinctive and proactive and must communicate well.
"Having done things that are a little bit different, having made maximum use of your time are all important - do lots of things that make you distinctive," he says.
"Think about which areas you would like to work in - write to them, call them, seek them out rather than wait for opportunities to come to you.
He also suggests videoing a mock interview with a friend or family member to boost self-awareness.
Adam Hale says young people looking for work should think about spending time abroad.
Graduates and school-leavers may also they can gain valuable skills by doing voluntary work for a while.
Martin Edmonson from Graduates Yorkshire says there are a "wealth of opportunities" to volunteer in the UK.
"There are plenty of worthwhile local charities that could really benefit from the skills that graduates can offer," he says.
"For instance, an IT graduate could build a website or a computer network, or a media graduate could produce promotional podcasts and videos.
Charities like Inter Cultural Youth Exchange offer graduates the chance to volunteer across the world on a variety of projects from promoting HIV/AIDS awareness to developing children's sports projects.
"There's never been a better time to gain new skills by volunteering abroad,'' said Shaffique Prabatani, chairman of ICYE.
The government is committed to ensure all young people in England remain in education or training until they are 18, rather than the current 16.
The Education and Skills Act 2008 means that, from 2013, all young people will be required to continue in education or training post-16.
Last year, the Department for Children, Schools and Families introduced the Diploma qualification in England which combines theoretical study with practical experience.
The Diplomas operate on three levels - foundation, higher and advanced - and help students to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for employment and higher education.
The government also says it is committed to growth in its apprenticeship scheme.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown recently announced a £140m package for 35,000 additional apprenticeship places over the coming year and to extend opportunities to people facing redundancy.
The New Deal is in place to provide more intensive support to the minority of young Job Seekers Allowance claimants who do not leave benefit quickly.
This year the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Dius) is issuing a "Life after graduation" booklet to all graduates in England.
It offers information on a range of options such as teaching, further study, volunteering and working abroad.
Dius is also increasing the number of career development loans on offer to young people.
The department has set up a new "graduate talent pool" as part of an internship programme.
The online talent pool will link employers - such as Microsoft, Marks and Spencer, Network Rail and the police service - with graduates, to help them build up work experience.
It is hoped internships will improve graduates' skills and experience and may in some cases lead to full-time work.
A study by graduate recruitment researchers High Fliers found the financial sector was particularly badly affected by the recession.
In recent years it had been a key growth area for jobs, but now graduate recruitment alone is expected to halve this year.
It is committed to having half of people educated to graduate level and to increasing skills generally to enable the UK to maintain competitiveness with the rest of the world.
He praised the "enormous amount of warmth and energy" Nick Clegg would bring to the job, succeeding Sir Menzies Campbell who quit in October.
He said the 40-year-old had an ability to reach out to younger people in a way that was "absolutely essential".
Mr Clegg said he was planning a "very big role" in his team for Mr Huhne.
Acting leader Vince Cable announced the winner in a packed room at London's St Martin's Lane Hotel.
He said it had been a "fiercely contested" leadership race and insisted that either man was ably suited to the top job.
"I have certainly been very struck during the campaign at the extent to which Nick has been able to reach out, particularly to younger people, and get them involved in the party in a way that is absolutely essential.
At that time, Aborigines were being rounded up and placed in settlements, like Toomelah, called missions, on land of no value to whites.
Each mission had a manager, who decided everything from what residents could wear, to where they could live, whom they could marry, how many children they had, where they could work.
The system was abolished in 1974.

In November the General Synod of the Church of England - the church's "parliament" - voted narrowly against the appointment of women as bishops.
The measure was passed by the Synod's Houses of Bishops and Clergy but was rejected by the House of Laity.
Speaking in the Commons, former minister Ben Bradshaw said everyone within the church thought women bishops was a "done deal".
Mr Bradshaw said the reforms must go through in months, not years, and that senior Church of England clergy should ask Parliament for help if they cannot change the rules to allow women bishops.
This could include amending the Equality Act which currently exempts the Church of England from allowing women to access its senior positions, he argued.
Conservative MP Martin Vickers said Parliament should "nudge the Church in the right direction" and told MPs "we should not completely rule out taking the matter into our own hands".
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes said he did not understand "why we are having to revisit this issue after so long".
He said nothing in scripture passages of the early church should prohibit women bishops.
But Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox urged Parliament to stay out of the issue.
Mr Cox told MPs it was "inevitable" there would be women bishops but said this was not something he could support.
Mr Kennedy has been taken to the Hospital of the Good Samaritan where he is undergoing emergency brain surgery.
He was was reported to shout "I did it for my country" after carrying out the attack.
The 24-year-old was immediately set upon by Mr Kennedy's bodyguards and then arrested and taken away by police.
It is thought Mr Kennedy's well documented support for Israel led to the attack.
Five other people were also injured but not seriously.
Mr Kennedy was on his way to a press conference in the hotel.
Mr Kennedy is favourite in the running to be named as the Democrat candidate in the next election.
Robert Kennedy is the younger brother of President John Kennedy who was assassinated in 1963 as he travelled in an open-top car in Dallas.
Sirhan Sirhan was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1969 following a four month trial.
There are many theories about the death of Robert Kenndy disputing the conviction of Sirhan Sirhan.
The Lions wing limped off in the fifth minute of Wales' 33-12 defeat to the Wallabies and scans have revealed a hamstring tear and a six-week layoff.
Williams joins Wales team-mates Mike Phillips and Lee Byrne on the Ospreys injury list for their European games.
But captain Ryan Jones is to recover from a back injury to play Viadana.
The Wales skipper suffered a back niggle in training but despite intensive treatment, Jones missed Saturday's Millennium Stadium humiliation to the Aussies.
Jones could sit out the Ospreys' Magners League clash with Munster in Swansea on Saturday but is set to be fit for the Ospreys Heineken Cup double-header with the Italians.
"Ryan will link back up with the Ospreys this week and should be taking some part in training and conditioning but will obviously be managed by his region," said Wales team physio Mark Davies.
The Ospreys will play Viadana in a Heineken Cup Pool Three clash in Reggio Emilia on 12 December before the Liberty Stadium return on 19 December.
And the Welsh region's final European pool games against Clermont Auvergne and Leicester Tigers are in mid to late January.
So Williams, who is also the Ospreys' back-up scrum-half, faces a race against time to be fit for those final Euro fixtures - and means the region must go into their Heineken Cup games with Viadana with just one scrum-half.
Injuries to Phillips, Jamie Nutbrown and Tom Issacs means that new South African scrum-half Ricky Januarie is the only registered fit number nine in the Ospreys' Heineken Cup squad.
"To have lost all three of our named nines for the tournament is an incredible situation, which resulted in us having to bring in emergency cover in the form of Ricky Januarie last week.
Williams, who does not require surgery to aid his recovery, is not just Wales' record try-scorer but is the Ospreys' top Heineken Cup try-scorer.
His score - and 11th try for the region in Europe - in their Heineken Cup draw at Leicester Tigers earlier this season is his only try for his region this term.
Williams' injury is a minor blow for Wales coach Warren Gatland also as the Ospreys star would have had limited game-time before their Six Nations opener against England at Twickenham on 6 February.
Jones' namesake Adam Jones could also join his skipper on the field against Viadana as the Lions and Wales prop is expected to make his return from shoulder surgery in the Ospreys' crucial European game.
The 28-year-old was injured playing for the Lions in their 28-25 second Test defeat to world champions South Africa in June.
Lions full-back Byrne is expected to return in the new year after suffering ligament damage in his right foot in the Ospreys' 32-32 Heineken Cup draw with Leicester.
Speaking to the German parliament, he said the EU must speak with one voice in the future, and gave details of a new Franco-German proposal for a European defence and security policy.
He said the European Union must have its own military capability - though it ought not to be in rivalry with Nato.
"Europeans must agree on more common ground within the EU treaties," Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was quoted as saying by the business daily Handelsblatt.
The BBC's Ray Furlong in Berlin says the German vision is one of a stronger Europe in the face of current US dominance.
He said that more common ground had to be found, especially with countries closer to the US position on Iraq.
"The degree of cooperation between [Germany and France] countries isone of the few welcome developments in the currentsituation," he said.
Mr Schroeder said the UN must have a monopoly on the use of force and that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction could only be dealt with multilaterally.
Then, he outlined proposals he has made with President Jacques Chirac of France for an enhanced EU defence and security policy.
These include the prospect of common military capabilities, such as European units implementing UN peacekeeping operations instead of national armies, and closer co-operation in planning structures and the arms industry.
On foreign affairs, EU ministers should decide on many joint initiatives by qualified majority voting, he said - a shift away from national policy-making.
Mr Fara, who was also a judge, was shot in the town of Khan Younis.
Inter-faction tensions have increased since the killing of three sons of a pro-Fatah security chief on Monday.
Reports say unidentified gunmen dragged Mr Fara from a taxi outside the courthouse where he worked and shot him at point blank range.
Witnesses said the gunmen had eaten breakfast in a nearby restaurant while waiting for the arrival of the Islamic court judge, who was also the local Hamas military commander.
Fatah spokesman Tawfiq Abu Khoussa rejected Hamas accusations that his group was behind the attack.
"The brothers in Hamas must be accurate and not fire accusations before the investigation," he said.
Fatah activists suggested that the killing was some kind of personal vendetta.
This was the second murder of a Palestinian judge in the same area in the last week.
Relations between the two Palestinian factions are always strained, but the tension has increased significantly following Monday's attack on the car of a senior Fatah security official, says the BBC's Alan Johnston in Gaza.
He was not in the vehicle, but his three sons, aged between six and 10, were and they all died in the gunfire.
On Tuesday, supporters on both sides exchanged gunfire in the Gaza Strip, wounding at least four people.
Hamas and Fatah have been engaged in months of fruitless talks to form a unity government to end the international isolation imposed on the Palestinian Authority since Hamas took power.
Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, of Hamas, said he was cutting short a month-long international tour in order to address the growing crisis.
"We will protect the national unity of the Palestinian people and we will thwart any attempt to instigate an inter-Palestinian struggle," Mr Haniya said.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has not publicly announced his plans, but aides say he may call early elections, a move decried by Hamas as a coup.
Hamas - which does not recognise Israel's legitimacy - won Palestinian parliamentary elections in January, triggering a western diplomatic and aid boycott of the PA.
The inquiry panel's report was made public shortly after being handed over to the new King Gyanendra.
Police were deployed in force as the report was published, amid fears of a repeat of the rioting that followed the 1 June massacre.
The two-man investigating panel set up by King Gyanendra to look into the killings interviewed more than 100 people during the week-long inquiry.
On Wednesday, they asked if they could speak to Dipendra's girlfriend Devyani Rana, who is believed to have fled Nepal immediately after the massacre.
But she is reportedly in Europe, and reluctant to return to Kathmandu.
The panel stressed that it was not giving its conclusions, but merely providing information it had acquired during its investigation.
But there were suggestions after the shooting that he had had a bitter row with his parents because they opposed his plans to marry Devyani Rana.
The killings shocked ordinary Nepalese, many of whom refused to believe that Dipendra was responsible.
Two people were killed and 19 injured in days of rioting after the massacre.
Three nights of curfews eventually helped calm the situation.
In Kathmandu, a ceremony has taken place to bid farewell to Dipendra's soul.
Tradition demands that 11 days after his death, a Brahmin priest should dress up in clothes and eat a ritually impure meal.
He is then escorted out of Kathmandu on an elephant, along with clothes, jewellery, furniture and other possessions of the late crown prince.
After spending three days in the adjoining town of Patan, he will have to leave the area, never to return again.
Crowds gathered to watch the ceremony, which was attended by top officials.
A similar ceremony was held on Monday for the late King Birendra.
The event "showcases some of the great things that England has given to the world," a Greater London Authority spokesman said.
Those performing include singer Seth Lakeman, violinist Eliza Carthy, The Demon Barbers and Jim Moray.
The gig is the culmination of a week of St George's Day celebrations organised by London Mayor Boris Johnson.
Mr Johnson said that St George's Day should be an event that English people get excited about.
"Where better to celebrate our patron saint than in the English capital?"
The club plans to build a 55,000-seater ground in a development that will also include high street shops, a hotel and a Tesco supermarket.
Its preferred site is in Kirkby town centre, off Cherryfield Drive.
Knowsley Councillor Eddie Connor has said the plans are at a very early stage.
"There is a lot of work to be done before any initial ideas are formed into something more definite," he said.
The council has pledged that the public and local businesses will be involved with the planning process.
Everton FC said an alternative to Goodison Park would increase capacity and improve corporate facilities.
The club's last plan to relocate to a 55,000-seater waterfront stadium at King's Dock, Liverpool, was abandoned in 2003.
Conflict is raging in the north of the country in Asia, between the Sri Lankan government and a group who are against them, called the Tamil Tigers.
About 100,000 ordinary Tamil people are thought to be trapped in the area where the fighting's happening.
Demonstrators in the UK want Britain to do more to demand a ceasefire.
On Monday, several roads in London had to be shut as police struggled to contain about 3,500 protesters.
It's the latest in a series of demonstrations that have been staged in the capital over the past two weeks.
The Sri Lankan government has rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying it would give the Tamil Tigers time to regroup.
The Tigers are fighting for their own separate state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.
The home side went ahead in the second minute when Matt Blinkhorn capitalised on a horrendous defensive error.
Wrexham's Mark Jones scored twice in a minute to turn the game on its head 15 minutes from time, only for Mark McGregor to respond with a late volley.
Darren Ferguson put Wrexham ahead again in extra time, but Keith Southern and Scott Vernon ensured a dramatic win.
My pre-match superstition starts on a Thursday.
I usually shave my head and sleep loads on the day of the match.
My pre-match meal consists of mashed potatoes, spaghetti and six egg whites and I'm usually walking around with my headphones on.
Most players know what they have to eat, what their ideal body weight is, so we basically look after ourselves.
But we do get guidance from a nutritionist.

Fifteen-year-old Gavin Arvizo returned to the stand for cross-examination by Mr Jackson's lawyers on Monday.
Last week the court in Santa Maria, California, heard the boy's account of how the alleged abuse took place.
The singer, who denies all charges, was in court for the first time since his late arrival last week with back pain.
During intensive cross-examination by Mr Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas Mesereau, Gavin conceded he had told a former teacher that nothing inappropriate had happened between him and the singer.
Gavin acknowledged from the witness stand his answer at the time - apparently just after a 2003 documentary which sparked the investigation into Mr Jackson - had been "no".
"I told Mr Alpert he [Michael Jackson] didn't do anything to me," the teenager said.
Mr Mesereau drew attention to numerous disciplinary problems the teenager had had at John Burroughs Middle School, where Mr Alpert was the dean.
Mr Jackson arrived 15 minutes early for proceedings on Monday, wearing a red coat with a black arm band.
On Thursday, the singer triggered a threat of arrest by the judge when he arrived late, wearing pyjamas and slippers.
In a statement, Mr Jackson's defence said he had been taken to a hospital for treatment for a severe back problem after tripping and falling over while getting dressed.
Later on Thursday, Gavin Arvizo described how the alleged abuse took place in the singer's bedroom at his Neverland ranch in 2003.
The teenager said he and Mr Jackson were in bed together and that, after asking the boy lots of questions about sex, Mr Jackson had put his hand down Gavin's pyjama bottoms and touched him.
He also described consuming various kinds of alcoholic drinks - including vodka, wine and brandy - with the star.
On Friday, the court heard legal arguments in which prosecutors sought access to Mr Jackson's financial records, claiming he has debts of $300m (�156m) and faces liabilities of $400m (�208m) by the end of the year.
The law would oblige firms producing a drug for adults in the EU to test if it can also be used for children.
It will also give firms an incentive to produce children's drugs, by adding six months to the patent protection period.
At present more than 50% of the drugs prescribed to children have not been tested for paediatric use, forcing doctors to guess the right dose.
After backing from the Health Council, the proposed law must be passed for a second time by the European Parliament and could become law by 2007.
Commission Vice-President Guenter Verheugen welcomed it as a "landmark agreement".
"This regulation will improve the health of children by ensuring innovation in the development of medicines for their use," he said.
At present, drug firms focus on making medicines for adults, because the market and the financial returns are larger.
Testing drugs on children is also more complicated and costly, because different age groups require different doses.
The regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use creates a new European paediatric committee to assess companies' plans for testing child medicines, and to absolve companies from carrying out the tests if the drug clearly has no application for children.
Similar legislation encouraging the production of medicines for children already exists in the US.
French Conservative MEP Francoise Grossetete, when the law was first approved by the European Parliament, described it as a big advance for science and health.
Anger has erupted into violence in several instances, with at least one death reported.
In Morocco, an estimated one million people gathered in the capital Rabat in an officially-sanctioned demonstration on Sunday.
In Cairo, dozens of demonstrators held a protest outside the emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers, many shouting "the liberation of the territories will happen with weapons and not with the peace initiative".
The largest protests in Europe took place in Rome on Saturday where about 20,000 protesters marched through the centre of the city before swelling their ranks to around 50,000 in the Piazza del Popolo, the Associated Press news agency reported.
A protester died in Bahrain on Sunday two days after sustaining a rubber-bullet wound during a mass demonstration outside the US embassy.
The demonstration turned into a riot with protesters hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails into the embassy grounds.
Jordanian officials have denied reports that the death of 10-year-old boy in a Palestinian refugee camp near Amman on Sunday was linked to earlier anti-Israel demonstrations there.
Hundreds of thousands gathered in the centre of the Moroccan capital Rabat chanting slogans and waving Palestinian flags and banners.
There have been unofficial protests and strikes by high-school students all over Morocco for the last two weeks, but this one is official.
In Paris, more than 20,000 people marched to the Place de la Bastille in a protest organised by anti-racism, communist and pro-Palestinians support groups.
Thousands more demonstrated in the cities of Nantes, Rennes, Rouen, Lille, Strasbourg, Metz, Grenoble and Marseilles.
Most of the rallies passed off peacefully, but in the south of France petrol bombs were thrown at a Jewish sports club, and Jewish organisations in the country said they were preparing to hold counter-demonstrations in the next few days.
In the Swiss capital of Bern more than 9,000 people attended a pro-Palestinian rally organised by the Swiss Socialist and Green parties.
And rallies across the country in Germany drew more than 5,000 people.
In Rome some marchers wore black face masks and scarves similar to those of Palestinian militants, while others carried banners calling for a "liberated Palestine".
And in the US, thousands marched demanding that Washington intervene in the Middle East crisis, with protesters walking across the Brooklyn Bridge carrying placards equating Mr Sharon with Hitler.
Bahrain and Jordan saw the most violent demonstrations In the Arab world, but Lebanon has also held seven consecutive days of rallies, the largest being in the mainly-Shia Muslim city of Baalbek, where an estimated 15,000 turned out for rallies.
In the Beirut suburb of Aukar violence erupted with police using tear gas to disperse crowds.
In Indonesia, one of the world's most populous Muslim nation, four days of protests culminated on Friday with more than 1,000 protesters clashing with police in the capital Jakarta, some pelting the heavily fortified US embassy with rotten vegetables.
Students from Tile Hill Wood, Lyng Hall and Hartshill Technology College, in Coventry, have interviewed Tony Blair.
They travelled to London to carry out the interview in Downing Street.
They appeared outside the prime minister's house live on BBC News 24 and described it as a "once in a lifetime experience".
Pardeep, who is 13 years old, described the prime minister as being "very approachable and talkative".
She asked Mr Blair about global warming, and whether he thought children were being forced to grow up too quickly.
She said he answered the questions very honestly.
Pupils from Park House School in Berkshire have interviewed David Cameron.
Global warming and poverty were at the top of the agenda for some of the pupils.
But others wanted to know more personal details, like who cuts the Tory leader's hair.
Bridie, 12, stunned Mr Cameron by asking who would he rather have dinner with - Gordon Brown or Tony Blair.
Mr Cameron was quick to rule out the possibility on the grounds that "there are no wannabe members of Take That" in his party.
The children were impressed and said Mr Cameron, who they interviewed in his constituency of Witney in Oxfordshire, had answered all their questions.
Villiers High School in Ealing, West London, have interviewed Sir Menzies.
They travelled to BBC Television Centre in London, where they received expert coaching before conducting the interview.
Afterwards, 13-year-old Tehreem said it had been "a privilege to meet someone with such high authority".
Two pupils from the Inverness Royal Academy questioned Alex Salmond.
Identical twins Maree and Karen, 13, tried a "good cop, bad cop" interviewing technique on the SNP leader.
They grilled him on subjects including global warming and the size of his carbon footprint.
"He would not stop talking, which was good," School Report news editor Maree said.
A group of 13-year-olds from Bishop Hedley School in Merthyr sent e-mails to Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones.
They asked questions including - "Who is your political hero?" and "what are the main political issues facing Wales?"
Mr Jones said his hero was Nelson Mandela and the major issues facing Wales included health, the environment and a lack of proper housing.
One of the pupils, Emily, said she had not known who Mr Jones was.
Another student, Liam, said he found the interview "very educating".
I want to create, however, a new breed, a new kind of computer system that is much simpler that allows kids to programme once again.
Mr McDonnell took 10,339 votes and the DUP's Jimmy Spratt was second with 9,104.
Ulster Unionist candidate Michael McGimpsey trailed in third place with 7,263 votes.
Mr McDonnell said people in South Belfast had "sent a loud and clear message that tribal politics is not the only way forward in Northern Ireland".
"We (the SDLP) are still standing strong and we are ready to fight back for the values that the people out on the streets and doorsteps want," he added.
The DUP's MEP, Jim Allister, blamed the nationalist win on David Trimble's party and what he said was its refusal to agree an electoral pact.
"The responsibility lies at the door of the UUP," he said.

Prime Minister Tony Blair faced a bitterly divided Commons to make the case for war in Iraq, despite the failure of his government to secure a second UN Security Council resolution explicitly authorising the invasion.
Mr Blair's decision to push ahead with the war in spite of its contested legal basis had prompted the resignation of his Cabinet colleague Robin Cook the previous evening.
Against this backdrop, the prime minister produced what many Westminster-watchers describe as his finest oratorical performance in the Commons.
"I have never put the justification for action as regime change," Mr Blair says at the start of this extract, the emotive finale to his speech.
He had already described in detail the UK's controversial legal basis for war.
But he then offers a series of moral arguments why regime change meant that the invasion was "the right thing" to do.
Despite failing to win over a single Liberal Democrat MP, the government won the vote by a convincing margin with the support of the Conservatives.
The invasion began two days later.

The debate was led by the Labour MP for Rhondda, Chris Bryant, who has said David Cameron has "something to hide" over his correspondence with former News International chief Rebekah Brooks and the prime minister's former Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson.
Mr Cameron has refused to answer questions from Mr Bryant about whether unpublished correspondence existed, saying the MP still owed him apology for an earlier accusation in April that he had misled Parliament.
Much of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry was taken up with questions about links between politicians and Rupert Murdoch's News International media company.
Two text messages from Mrs Brooks to Mr Cameron, now passed on to the Leveson Inquiry, have recently been published by the Mail on Sunday.
Diouf was originally suspended for three games following his side's stormy quarter-final defeat to Tunisia at the Cup of Nations, in which Diouf had a running feud with referee Ali Bujsaim.
The Liverpool striker had to be restrained at the end of the game.
Technical staff members Amara Traore, Abdoulaye Sarr and Doctor Fallou Cisse were also banned from the touchline for a year - Sarr's ban has now been increased to 18 months.
"These measures have been taken due to Senegal launching an appeal instead of asking for clemency," said Amadou Diakite, a member of the CAF executive committee.
The suspensions come into effect from the start of the 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign which gets underway in June.
The Russians meet defending champions United States on Friday, who routed Greece 102-72 in their quarter-final.
Brazil, led by 27 points, including two late free throws from captain Janeth Arcain, just managed to get the better of Spain 67-63.
They will meet Australia in the last four after they proved too good for New Zealand, winning 94-55.
Lauren Jackson once again led the Australia team with 28 points while Penny Taylor added 12.
Shannon Johnson top-scored for USA with 21 points as the American team stayed on course for their third successive Olympic gold medal.
Greece, backed by a raucous home crowd, were restricted to just 17 points in the second half as their opponents made it six wins out of six.
The kind of life that Robert Maxwell enjoyed now seems to have belonged to another era, one of excess, ridiculous extravagance and outrageous behaviour.
Flying around London and the world by helicopter or private jet, seeking meetings with heads of state, throwing lavish parties in his own honour, splashing his exploits across the Mirror newspaper, Maxwell's behaviour was showy and brash.
He may have plundered the pension funds to help his ailing companies, but it was also to finance a lifestyle for which he had long since stopped counting the pennies.
Jay contends, as others have before, that Maxwell only understood two relationships, buyer and seller and master and slave.
Those who weren't holding a chequebook were treated slightly differently.
His sons were among those bullied, dismissed and humiliated.
His employees were at his beck and call, night and day.
Tony Delano - now at the London College of Printing - indicated that many of his employees could brave out some of Maxwell's criticism.
For bullies to get what they want, they need cowards and Maxwell did succeed in surrounding himself with people prepared to do as he said.
"He had a very high level of low cunning, he learnt about British ways, and British values, he saw how eminently corruptible the British were and how cheap they were to corrupt," Delano said.
Greed may have been good - at least for Maxwell - but it doesn't seem to have been much fun.
Living alone in a flat above his office, he could lay claim to few friends, having formally separated from his wife and at odds with some of his children.
Export growth is continuing to help Japan's economy to pick up.
Finance Minister Naoto Kan said the figures reflected steady growth but warned that the country remained mired in deflation.
Roland Buerk reports from Tokyo.
It also shows that more than 10% of children are in step-families and that at least 45,000 youngsters live in communal establishments.
The third set of data to be released from the Census further reveals that single-pensioner households now account for almost one in seven homes.
The latest information from the �200m survey was released on Wednesday morning by the Office for National Statistics.
But around 149,000 children under 18 are providing unpaid care within their family, the Census revealed.
The latest data also looks at previously released information and cross-refers it, to illustrate society in different ways.
It shows that among elderly people more women over the age of 75 are living alone than men.
And among these lone pensioners 5,000 have neither central heating nor sole use of a bathroom.
Census details have already shown the UK's population to be more than 58m, a 4% increase from the 1981 count.
Over 225,000 of these carers said they were not in good health themselves.
When it comes to full-time paid care work, there is a larger proportion of men, the data reveals.
For the first time in the Census people could describe themselves as being of "mixed ethnicity".
Some 660 people in England and Wales used this description for themselves, the largest number stating they were White and Black Caribbean.
More than half of those in three different ethnic groups were born in England and Wales.
Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups showed much lower employment rates than the Indian group and they also suffered from poorer health.
The Irish and Black Caribbean groups also reported poorer health than average.
There are further detailed breakdowns of the age profiles and faith elements of ethnic groups.
It showed there was a minority of married couples for the first time - 45% of the population versus 64% in 1981.
On Thursday People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) will hand out 30 all-fur coats and jackets in a variety of styles.
Dawn Carr, of Peta, told BBC News Online they had been donated by animal-lovers who had themselves received them as presents or people who had had a change of heart about the suffering of animals captured in the wild or raised on fur farms.
To show these furs were "recycled", the garments had had white stripes painted on the arms, so the recipients would not be left "open to ridicule for wearing something so cruel", Ms Carr said.
Bond girl Barbara Bach and Playboy magazine centrefold Kimberley Hefner were among those who had donated furs, she added.
They had been "sickened by expos�s of cruelty to animals caught in steel-jaw leg-hold traps and driven mad in tiny fur farm cages", Ms Carr said.
Peta has already sent shipments of unwanted fur coats to war refugees in Afghanistan and homeless people in Denver in the United States.
The coats would otherwise have been burned or buried.
Ms Carr said Liverpool had been chosen as the first UK city to benefit because it was a "cold city with lots of homeless people".
But Peta hoped to repeat the great fur giveaway in all the country's "main cities", she added.
Last month Peta launched a new advertising campaign against fur, alleging cruelty to animals.

The Queen delivered the speech on 18 November 2009, during the traditional ceremony from the House of Lords.
Other key measures outlined in the speech include a legal obligation to halve the budget deficit within four years and a promise to clamp down on bankers who take too many financial risks.
There will also be free social care for the neediest pensioners in England.
Her Majesty delivered the speech from the throne in the House of Lords.
While it is called the Queen's Speech, it is written by the government and approved by the Cabinet - and the Queen reads the speech in the same tone throughout to indicate Her Majesty's neutrality.

After an even first half of few clear chances, Neal Bishop eluded the City defence at the near post to glance an Alan Gow corner into the top corner.
But with 10 minutes left Micah Richards escaped down the right and crossed superbly for Dzeko, who volleyed into the roof of the net from close range.
Both sides had chances in the closing stages but a fine match finished level.
The meeting of England's oldest club against perhaps the world's wealthiest always promised an intriguing encounter, but it almost produced the shock of the 2010-11 competition.
Nottingham Rugby Club share the famous ground with County and the consequence has been a pudding-like pitch, reminiscent of the surface at Edgar Street where Ronnie Radford scored one of the great FA Cup goals as Hereford stunned Newcastle in 1972.
Featuring immense physical specimens Richards, Yaya Toure and Patrick Vieira, City were never likely to be muscled out of things, but they were matched for commitment from the outset by County seeking a triumph of similar prominence.
Gow curled a free-kick just wide of the post, having been brought down in the opening moments.
But City's slick passing soon cut through the home side's spirited pressing as Richards raced clear on the overlap to collect Dzeko's neat pass and sent an inviting low cross for Toure, whose sliding goal-bound effort was diverted over the bar by keeper Stuart Nelson with his legs.
Dzeko's first attempt on goal was a speculative shot from 25 yards which went almost the same distance high and wide, much to the delight of a vociferous home crowd, who were quick to let him know their thoughts about the value of his £27m move from Wolfsburg.
As the match continued in cut-and-thrust fashion at a frantic pace, Dzeko almost seized on a loose ball on the edge of the six-yard box but Krystian Pearce produced a vital intervention and County were content with life at the break.
City boss Roberto Mancini had been exasperated by his side's failings and the six-time Italian Cup winner clearly had some strong words for them during the interval.
But it was County who struck the first blow as Bishop ghosted clear to glance in his first goal since February 2010.
The visitors urgently sought a response but Pablo Zabaleta's cross was headed narrowly over by Dzeko and Nelson tipped over Gareth Barry's 25-yard strike that was destined for the roof of the net.
However, eventually a moment of high quality brought City level.
David Silva, who had replaced the ineffective Jo, threaded an intricate crossfield pass to release the athletic Richards sprinting into space down the right flank again and Dzeko applied the composed first-time finish stretching with his left foot.
Veteran striker Lee Hughes, 34, headed wide in the final moments for County who now look forward to a replay at Eastlands.

Sturridge scores for Chelsea against Stoke (UK users only)
The 21-year-old has made only four starts this season, with 17 substitute appearances, scoring four goals.
Sturridge was Chelsea's top scorer in the FA Cup last season as they added the trophy to the league title.
He was initially offered to Liverpool during this transfer window as part of Chelsea's bid to sign Reds striker Fernando Torres.
Since moving from Manchester City in 2009, Sturridge has struggled to make his mark in a Chelsea side that includes forwards Anelka, Didier Drogba, Florent Malouda and Solomon Kalou.
Coyle insists that the arrival of Sturridge will be a huge positive for the club.
"I think he's such an exciting young talent who I believe will have a very positive impact, probably similar to the impact Jack Wilshere had last year, because I believe this is a player who is capable of playing in the Chelsea team, as Jack Wilshere was capable of playing in the Arsenal team.
"Sometimes at elite clubs there's a tendency to maybe not quite be convinced because of their youth and everything else, so it gives Daniel the platform to go and show everybody what he has in his locker.
"He has attributes in abundance and I'm very excited to see him in a Bolton shirt," he added.
It is believed United had an initial bid rejected by the Hornets for striker Smith, who scored 17 goals last season, two weeks ago, Reading and Wolves are also said to be interested.
Smith, 29, has spent eight seasons at Vicarage Road in two spells, he also played for Sunderland and Derby.
Republic of Ireland international midfielder O'Toole, 20, had a three-month loan-spell at United from Vicarage Road last season, he made nine appearances scoring once.
Meanwhile Scottish winger McIndoe, 29, joined Bristol City from Wolves in August 2007 and has scored 13 goals in 97 appearances.
Blades have also confirmed that goalkeeper Ian Bennett, 37, has agreed a new one-year contract while Fulham winger Julian Gray has started a two-week trial at Brammall Lane.
The Swede was one of the few players to hold a winning head-to-head record against the American but Agassi destroyed Enqvist 6-0 6-3 6-3.
Agassi posted his 24th straight Australian Open win in just 89 minutes, levelling his career record against Enqvist at 5-5.
In-form Agassi goes on to face Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand.
And he will be brimming with confidence after a commanding display against a hapless Enqvist.
The eight-time Grand Slam winner set the tone when he raced through the opening set, breaking the Swede's service three times in just 21 minutes.
Agassi went on to break Enqvist's serve a total of seven times, dropping his own serve just once early in the third set.
"You go out there with a really clear idea of what you want to do when you've played each other so many times.
The Thai 13th seed cantered through in straight sets 6-3 7-5 6-4 against the three-times French Open winner.
Until this year Kuerten had not progressed beyond the second round in seven visits.
Blake, who reached the same stage last year, advanced 6-1 6-3 6-2 in little over an hour.
Patience, without a Grand Slam singles win before arriving in Melbourne, had beaten Russians Igor Andreev and Nicolay Davydenko in previous rounds.
Blake next faces Marat Safin, who beat Todd Martin in five sets.
The American defeated Safin at the Hopman Cup earlier this month and said he would play with the same attitude.
"I'm not going to go out there and play not to lose and let them roll me," Blake said.
Ninth seeded Grosjean dropped the first set against Dominik Hrbaty but came back to beat the Slovakian 2-6 6-4 6-1 6-3.
Sjeng Schalken, the 16th seed, defeated Jurgen Melzer of Austria 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 6-1 and will now play top seed Andy Roddick.
But I was not in the US - I sat in front of my computer at home to watch the programme, which I had downloaded from the internet in the interests of research in about five hours.
The growing online availability of TV programmes, and films, is the latest threat to the entertainment industry still reeling from the effect of peer-to-peer programs, such as Kazaa and the now-defunct Napster.
After ER, I watched the latest instalment of thriller 24, a new episode of Frasier and a new episode of Friends, again all in the interests of research.
Almost all the programmes had been broadcast less than a day earlier in the US, many months before viewers in the UK and Europe will see them.
One friend who downloads drama The West Wing is more than a year ahead of episodes in the UK.
I used a program called BitTorrent to download the shows, a piece of software which allows multiple people to download the same programme at the same time.
It is not the only piece of software one can use, but uniquely BitTorrent allows multiple users to exchange the same information.
As I download Friends, another user is taking it from me, who in turn is providing it to someone else, and so on.
The effect is that the more people who are trying to access the programme, the easier and quicker it is to obtain.
But Jacqueline Hurt, a solicitor specialising in media law, said the programmes were being distributed without licence and therefore illegally distributed.
"Until now the effect of the internet on TV and film has been small because of the speed issues involved in downloading.
At the moment, the numbers using programs like BitTorrent are limited but if the practice were to take off then it could have widespread implications, she said.
But broadcasters, especially those in the UK, remain unaware of the growing trend of downloading programmes.
"The value of a programme to broadcasters will go down if the programme is readily available on the internet," warned Ms Hurt.
Why should Channel 4 spend its money importing hit US shows when they have been available online for weeks, if not months?
Mr Adegoke said the TV industry, like the music industry before it, would be taken completely by surprise.
"If this goes from being a niche activity to the mainstream it will be virtually impossible to stop.
"This is exactly what happened to the music industry.
The range of shows is restricted at the moment to the biggest US shows and to programmes with loyal fan bases, such as science fiction.
A popular programme can take between five and seven hours to download, while a film can take twice as long and a more obscure programme up to a whole day.
BitTorrent itself does not advocate infringing copyright and the program can be used for exchanging any type of information, but the most popular is certainly TV shows and films.
The TV industry is already aware of many BitTorrent sites, and is closing them down as fast as it can find them.
But with web space so readily available it only takes a short time to put up a web page and link to the latest programmes.
The European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) has a "fast-track" procedure which it could use to speed the lengthy regulatory process separating a new drug from the open market.
Kathy Redmond, a healthcare consultant working in Milan, said that the fast-track mechanism had only been called into action for a series of anti-HIV/Aids drugs, and Viagra, the erectile dysfunction drug.
One cancer drug, in comparison, took two-and-a-half years to pass through the approval process.
In the US, she found, the situation is quite different - on average, approval of cancer drugs takes 273 days, compared to the European average of 471.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-tracked 28 drugs in 1999 - five of which were cancer drugs.
The classic example of a cancer drug denied to UK patients for years is the breast cancer drug Herceptin, which has been available to patients in the US for more than four years.
It was finally licenced for use in the UK in 1999 - however, in many places in the UK, women who want the drug have to pay for it themselves as the NHS has still not decided whether or not to fund it.
A decision has been deferred to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and it is expected soon.
Ms Redmond said that the effectiveness of the HIV/Aids lobby is one of the reasons why the approval of drugs for these patients is delivered more quickly.
Dr Kathleen Pritchard, Head of Clinical Trials at the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, said that a fine balance had to be drawn between safety and speed.
Doctors in the United States analysed 47 studies looking at the impact Tai Chi had on people with chronic health problems, like heart disease or MS.
They found that it could improve balance control, flexibility and even the health of their heart.
Writing in The Archives of Internal Medicine, they said it also reduced stress, falls, pain and anxiety.
Tai Chi originated in China where it has been used for hundreds of years.
It combines deep breathing with relaxation and postures that flow from one to another through slow movements.
They say it is also helpful for people with psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety or stress.
This latest study by doctors at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston suggests there is medical evidence to back up those claims.
Their findings are based on a review of studies published in English and Chinese.
"Overall, these studies reported that long-term Tai Chi practice had favourable effects on the promotion of balance control, flexibility and cardiovascular fitness and reduced the risk of falls in elders," the researchers said.
They said the martial art helped to reduce "pain, stress and anxiety in healthy subjects".
But it also had benefits for people with serious conditions, such as heart disease and high blood pressure.
Bob Weatherall, secretary of the British Council of Chinese Martial Arts, welcomed the findings.
"The health aspects of Tai Chi are well documented," he told BBC News Online.
Parents whose children died or were permanently injured due to their babies being shaken have protested outside an Apple store about an application called Baby Shaker.
Apple has apologised for the "deeply offensive" iPhone application , which made a game of quietening crying babies by shaking them.
Patrick Donohue and Jennipher Dickens are both parents of baby shake victims; they explained why they are so angry about the game outside an Apple store in New York.
The official number of confirmed cases across the UK stood at 1,058 on Thursday 5 April.
Northern Ireland has imposed a complete ban on the import of animal and dairy products from other parts of the UK.
Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire is temporarily closed to protect its animals from the disease, and Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire has banned cars.
The 59-year-old record-breaking adventurer had a heart attack on board an easyJet plane which wasdue to take off from Bristol airport to Edinburgh on Saturday.
Cabin crew contacted emergency services and he was taken to the Bristol Royal Infirmary where he had surgery on Saturday night.
Sir Ranulph's wife Virginia is at his bedside.
An easyJet spokeswoman said on Sunday that 130 passengers and five crew had been on board the flight, which was delayed for three hours.
Sir Ranulph's expeditions to remote parts of the globe have seen him achieve outstanding goals - and overcome potentially life-threatening situations in the process.
"The bottom line is that you don't see a crevasse until you fall down it," the old Etonian once said.
In 1993, Sir Ranulph became one of the first men to walk unaided across Antarctica.
Severe frostbite dramatically halted the Exmoor-based explorer's attempt to reach the North Pole in 2000.
He plunged into freezing water when one of the two food supply sledges he was towing fell through thin ice.
The names of the 8,923 donors - or those of deceased loved ones - have been permanently inscribed on donor and in-memoriam boards.
They are on display in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum's main hall.
The appeal raised almost �13m of the �28m needed to refurbish Kelvingrove which reopened on 11 July.
Glasgow Lord Provost Liz Cameron and Lord Macfarlane, chairman of the appeal, will unveil the plaques.
If it hadn't been for Winston Churchill I probably wouldn't be here to tell the tale, because I think there was a very good chance that England would have been invaded.
The Nazis would have come in and done what they did to Jews all over Europe.
I avoided being bombed because I was born after the Battle of Britain, but I feel his importance to British history is second to none.
Churchill managed to generate that most incredible feeling among the British people by his personality, stature and speeches.
We went to see him lying in state on the Friday [29 January] - the day before he was buried.
It was very cold and very wet and we walked in the dark for a long time.
We joined the end of the queue - people know what the queues were like for the Queen Mum recently - I think they were even longer.
I hadn't experienced the Blitz and suddenly people were talking about that feeling the population got in the Blitz.
Nobody was pushing or shoving and everybody was good humoured.
People were sharing their sandwiches and their Thermos flasks and it was just a wonderful feeling.
I felt I was part of history - it was the end of an era.
The visitors took the lead against the run of play on 34 minutes when Andrew Drury's corner was headed into his own net by Daniel Parslow.
But York continued to dominate and went close through Michael Brodie, Alex Lawless and Adam Smith.
The equaliser finally came when Barrett headed in from an Alex Lawless corner.
The visitors started well with Jermain Defoe missing a sitter after Armand Traore had hit the post.
But Villa had numerous chances to get a second-half winner with John Carew heading against the bar late on.
Pompey midfielder Sean Davis was unlucky to be sent off with 10 minutes remaining after a second yellow card.
It was an unfortunate end to the match for Pompey boss Harry Redknapp, who this weekend celebrates 25 years in management.
Villa manager Martin O'Neill meanwhile, was looking to get their solid start to the season back on track after being outclassed by Chelsea before the international break.
The home side had maintained an unchanged starting 11 for all seven of their league games but O'Neill gave a league debut to defender Carlos Cuellar and handed James Milner a first league start in his second spell with the club.
Making only his second start for Pompey, Glen Little was soon marauding down the right wing and his accurate cross saw Traore set up Davis for a low snap-shot on the edge of box, which Villa keeper Brad Friedel gathered well.
Ban coin 'moron' for life - Redknapp
On six minutes Carew lashed a left-foot volley just over David James' crossbar as the match opened up quickly.
Adventurous Pompey were looking to expose Villa's high back line and, Sol Campbell and Carew, reminiscent of two heavyweight boxers, were in a constant battle for scraps of possession when the home side pushed on.
Portsmouth's England internationals Peter Crouch and Defoe showed some neat link-up play on 20 minutes with the former setting up the latter to shoot just over the bar from long range.
Defoe was again the provider when he nudged the ball to Traore, who crashed his effort against the upright.
As the ball bounced off the post, it hit a bewildered Friedel before Defoe volleyed over from four yards out.
Shortly before half-time Little again whipped in a decent deep cross for Crouch but he could only head weakly into the hands of Friedel as he attempted to guide the ball back on the direction it came.
Villa looked more lively early in the second half but, after Stiliyan Petrov drifted a clever cross-field ball into the heart of Pompey's back-pedalling defence, Young - with time and space to spare - could only drag a low shot well wide.
Minutes later Davis was booked for a challenge from behind on Nigel Reo-Coker as Villa continued to up the tempo in front of a vociferous home crowd.
Papa Bouba Diop was booked for hacking down Young as he broke directly towards goal after 73 minutes and the young winger tested James from the resulting free-kick.
Defoe had netted five goals in his last five Premier League matches but could not add to that run when he cracked a right-foot shot high over the bar after cleverly peeling off a posse of defenders to meet Johnson's smart free-kick.
I thought we would sneak it - O'Neill
Davis was harshly sent off for his second yellow card with 10 minutes remaining after appearing to only slightly clip the heels of Petrov as the Villa man broke clear in midfield.
Villa almost scored when James sliced an attempted punched clearance but with the ball skidding towards goal, Campbell hacked clear to safety.
And they came within inches of a late winner when Young drifted a cross onto the head of Carew who headed onto the bar from 18 yards out with James stranded.
Though Villa could not make the breakthrough, they remain unbeaten at home in the Premier League, while Pompey have stemmed the tide after losing four of the last five away league matches.
Adebayor has been banned for three games for violent conduct after a clash with ex-Gunners team-mate Robin van Persie in City's 4-2 win on Saturday.
Adebayor also faces an improper conduct charge for his goal celebration.
The 25-year-old, who joined City from Arsenal for £25m in the summer, caught Van Persie's face with his boot during the second half of his team's victory last Saturday.
He misses Sunday's trip to Manchester United and home games against Fulham - in the Carling Cup - and West Ham.
Adebayor may also have to explain his goal celebration in front of the Arsenal fans, with City having until 30 September to respond to the Football Association's charge.
The Togo striker believes he was fully justified in running the length of the pitch to celebrate a goal before the away supporters.
"There is only so much abuse a man can take until he reaches breaking point," Adebayor told The Sun.
"People talk about us as being football players and the money we earn, but just because we are fortunate does not mean we need to take abuse.
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger tried to move on from the Adebayor situation on Friday but defended his work with the player.
"In our job you accept that you give and do not expect any return, so you are never disappointed," said the Frenchman.
"I believe I succeeded (with Adebayor as a player), but you can always do better and that is what is my approach.
Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Eboue, however, says he was disappointed by his former colleague's behaviour.
I made Adebayor a better player - Wenger
"I am very, very happy because the FA have given him a three-game ban (for the Van Persie stamp).
But Adebayor, who counts Eboue as one of his closest friends at Arsenal, says his former team-mates also showed his a lack of respect.
"There were players from Arsenal who refused to shake my hand before kick-off," he added.
"I have spent a lot of time with them and I thought they were my friends, but the way some of them behaved is just crazy.
He listed a number of banned weapons Iraq had failed to account for and accused President Saddam Hussein of lying to the world.
BBC Washington correspondent Justin Webb says the address was not quite a declaration of war - but it came close.
In the address, the US president also highlighted domestic issues - including the economy, taxes, and healthcare.
Although there are nearly two years to go before the next presidential election, analysts say Mr Bush's performance could be vital in reversing a downward trend in his popularity.
In their response, the opposition Democrats have criticised the president's economic plans - but supported him on Iraq.
"Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm," Mr Bush said.
Mr Bush announced that he would ask the United Nations Security Council to meet on 5 February to consider "Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world".
He said Secretary of State Colin Powell would present intelligence about Iraq's weapons programs, "its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links to terrorist groups".
Our diplomatic correspondent Barnaby Mason said the question now is whether America's evidence about alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction turns out to be detailed, new or convincing.
"Most intriguing is whether the Bush administration can give substance to its vague charge of links between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda," he said.
In his hour-long address, Mr Bush touched on a range of foreign and domestic policy issues.
In their response to the speech, the Democrats attacked the president's economic plan.
"We think it's upside down economics," Washington state Governor Gary Locke said on behalf of the minority Democrats.
"It does too little to stimulate the economy now and does too much to weaken our economic future," he said.
The Democrats have opposed President Bush's plan to cut taxes on shareholders' dividends, saying the move would favour the wealthy.
However on Iraq and nuclear proliferation Mr Locke backed the president - although he stressed the need for international consultation.
"We also support the president in working with our allies and the United Nations to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-il of North Korea," Mr Locke said.
A tie-up, the Competition Commission said, would not lead to a "substantial lessening of competition".
The commission began an investigation into the offer after independent book retailers voiced opposition to the bid.
In March, the commission gave its provisional backing to the bid, saying a takeover was "not likely to affect book prices, range of titles offered or quality of service".
Its latest report concluded that competition from online stores such as Amazon and supermarkets meant that a merger of two of the biggest names in bookselling on the High Street would have little effect on the market.
Ottakar's said it welcomed the Commission's decision, however, HMV has not yet said whether it will renew its offer.
Meanwhile, experts said that the delay to a deal may be to the entertainment retailer's advantage, as it will not have to pay as high a price for the bookseller.
Analysts now expect HMV to make an offer of 360p a share, significantly lower than the 400p at which it made its previous bid.
Earlier this month HMV Group fended off a �280m offer for its Waterstone's business from the founder of the bookshop, Tim Waterstone.
He has been accused of misusing computer codes owned by a former employer, unnamed in court papers but reportedly Goldman Sachs.
Mr Aleynikov was released on Monday, having met the $750,000 bail (£463,000) after his arrest by the FBI on Friday.
He left his job at Goldman, where he earned $400,000 a year, in June.
A transcript of Mr Aleynikov's attendance before a US magistrate on Saturday showed that he worked for Goldman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs said it did not comment on former employees.
The FBI arrested Mr Aleynikov, 39, as he disembarked from a flight in Newark on Friday, according to FBI documents.
Sabrina Shroff, Mr Aleynikov's lawyer, said her client did not plan to sell the information or use it "contrary to my employment agreement with Goldman Sachs".
The case has raised issues about how safe such lucrative trading systems are.
As well as the $750,000 bond required as part of the bail, Mr Aleynikov was required to deliver $75,000 in cash and hand over travel documents.
Mr Aleynikov is accused of using proprietary information and uploading it to a computer based in Germany.
He argued that he had only meant to use open-source computer files, as opposed to propriety information, but later "realised that he had obtained more files than he intended", FBI court papers stated.
According to the court documents Mr Aleynikov "shall not access the computer data that is the subject of this criminal action".
As well as the accusation of stealing "trade secrets", the documents from the Southern District of New York court cite a "scheme to defraud" as one of the complaints made against Mr Aleynikov.
The 40-year-old daughter of Elvis Presley said the story, which was widely republished worldwide, forced her to confirm she is expecting a baby.
Her UK laywer Simon Smith said claims that she had an "unhealthy appetite" and is "growing like her dad" had left the star "deeply upset and offended".
Presley called the press "disgusting" on her MySpace page.
The singer, who is issuing the libel claim against the Daily Mail's publishers, Associated Newspapers, at the High Court in London, also explained why she was forced into disclosing her pregnancy.
"I have had to show my cards and announce under the gun and under vicious personal attack that I am in fact pregnant," she wrote.
The announcement comes days after photos of Presley eating lunch in Los Angeles emerged in some newspapers poking fun at her weight gain.
"Once they got a glimpse of my expanding physique a few days ago, they have been like a pack of coyotes circling their prey whilst eerily howling with delight," said Presley.
She claimed publications in London, New York and Chicago wrote "false defamatory degrading stories" about why she could be putting on weight.
"Now that things are confirmed, hopefully they can stop all of the harassment and I can stop dodging the continuous bullets," she said.
Speaking to the Associated Press, her spokeswoman Cindy Guagenti said some of the stories had gone too far.
Presley said both she and husband, music producer Michael Lockwood, were "incredibly happy" about their news.
She already has an 18-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son from her first marriage to musician to Danny Keough.
She briefly married Michael Jackson in 1994 and then actor Nicolas Cage.
Nashi describe themselves as a "democratic, anti-fascist, youth movement".
This week, they have been using their own tactics to show their support for Russia in its row with Estonia.
They have picketed the Estonian embassy in Moscow.
They broke into a hall in the centre of Moscow where the Estonian ambassador was about to give a news conference, and clashed with the ambassador's guards.
There were even reports of their activists trying to stop Russian trucks from delivering goods to Estonia.
The "blockade" of the embassy, as Nashi described it, was lifted only when the ambassador went on leave.
Nashi claimed it as a victory.
The progress of the action was gleefully catalogued on their website, under a picture of the Soviet war memorial in Tallinn, whose removal sparked Moscow's dispute with its neighbour.
The site has a link for those who want to know more about "Estonian state fascism".
Nashi have a history of tailing diplomats they do not approve of.
Most of their members are in their teens or 20s.
Nashi members deny they are paid to turn out - but it is an allegation which is persistently made against them.
To some, their well-organised, well-attended, rallies suggest the presence of the Kremlin's helping hand.
One name which comes up in discussions like that is Vladislav Surkov.
At an extremely rare news conference last year, he spoke of a "boom" in youth movements in Russia.
Nashi are certainly among the Kremlin's supporters.
Their "manifesto", as outlined on their website, overflows with patriotic sentiment, and praise for Mr Putin.
Mr Putin has previously honoured these most fervent of his admirers with personal visits to their summer camps.
Nashi are proud of what Mr Putin has achieved during his time in office.
Aside from their street protests and rallies, they have an education programme.
They want to create new leaders for the 21st century - a generation which will build on the successes of its first decade.
They have no time for anyone who does not share their vision.
The relative standing of these two movements was clearly illustrated last month.
Another Russia's demonstration was broken up by riot police.
On the same day, the Young Guard - the youth wing of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party - and Nashi both held much larger, officially sanctioned rallies.
This is not a country on the verge of an orange or rose revolution.
Russia has a new sense of national pride.
Anyone who questions or challenges the value of that may get a visit from Nashi.
So news of a crisis in South Ossetia will have had plenty of people reaching for their atlases and dictionaries of pronunciation - after all, only old hands will remember the way violence flared here in the past as Georgia began to build its independence on the ruins of the old Soviet Union.
South Ossetia was one of the three enclaves within the new country - the others were Abkhazia and Ajaria - which had traditionally enjoyed the status of semi-autonomous regions under the Soviet constitution.
Separatists in each region decided their interests and loyalties lay with Moscow and set about resisting attempts by the newly independent government in Tbilisi.
There were inconclusive bouts of violence, which established two key facts - first, Georgia didn't have the military firepower or the political will to bring the rebel regions to heel.
Secondly, the existence of those loyalist populations gave Russia a licence to meddle in the affairs of a republic which it regards as a permanent part of its own sphere of influence.
So Georgia's independence has always been constrained to some extent by the proximity of that powerful and intimidating neighbour to the north.
Georgia's American-educated, English-speaking leader Mikhail Saakashvili is always careful to stress that he wants better relations with Russia - but his attempts to exert control over the wayward enclave of South Ossetia were always bound to bring him into conflict with Moscow.
He has a point when he argues that this off-shore off-shoot of Russia has become a haven for criminality and corruption, but this is really all about sovereignty.
It has implications far beyond the frontiers of the old Soviet Union though, because of the strategy the West pursued as the communist superpower collapsed in the early 1990s.
Essentially, it held out the promise for countries like Georgia of full membership of the club of Western nations - and that meant the right to join Nato as well as the European Union.
It was relatively easy for countries like Poland and the Czech Republic to travel that road - they were after all merely former satellite states of eastern Europe.
It was possible - although more difficult - for the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
They had been independent European states within living memory, had plenty of support from old allies in the continent and in any case began the process while Russia was still reeling from Soviet collapse.
In Russian eyes, at least, Georgia is different.
First it lies on Russia's southern border in the turbulent Caucasus region, and the Kremlin would not want to see a Nato presence in such a violent and unpredictable place.
More importantly, it is part of what Russians would regard as a kind of heartland of influence - Russians have seen their borders fluctuate in recent centuries according to their fluctuating political fortunes but they believe their right to influence in certain areas transcends the precise location of those borders at any given moment.
Mr Saakashvili - Western-oriented and ambitious for his country - tends to complicate the picture.
Western leaders would admit that guarantees were given to republics like Georgia in the past, but the world of diplomacy is a world of pragmatism and those guarantees have to be seen in the overall context of the West's desire to maintain the best possible relationship with Moscow.
So expect plenty of calls for restraint and ceasefire from the West, but don't expect much else - after all America needs Russian co-operation on more pressing issues like North Korea and other members of the Western alliance like Germany will hardly be anxious for a confrontation with a country that supplies much of their energy needs.
You don't start a military showdown with someone who can turn the gas off.
President Saakashvili sees the world to some extent in the same moral and ideological terms as George W Bush, and is very free with talk of the need to defend liberty.
He compares Russia's military actions today with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, or the Soviet intervention to crush Czechoslovakian liberalisation in the Prague Spring of 1968.
In both cases of course, the democracies of the West were unwilling or unable to contain aggression - and Mr Saakashvili is hoping to shame them into reacting more strongly this time around with those carefully chosen examples.
He is likely to be disappointed.
It would be difficult even for Washington to accede to a Georgian request for transport aircraft to bring Georgian combat troops home from Iraq without looking as though it was involving itself directly in an armed conflict with Russia.
The best the US state department and the foreign ministries of Europe can hope for is a quick fix to end the violence and bring in humanitarian supplies, followed by some long-term commitment in Moscow and Tbilisi to some kind of dialogue.
The fact that speech made no progress in reducing tensions in the region - and in fact served only to push the two countries closer to war - is a point highlighted by many of the papers.
They say that General Musharraf was aiming to please the international community and his domestic audience, rather than extending an olive branch to India.
But the commentator urges the Indian government not to rise to the bait.
In a commentary, the paper says that it is one of the toughest speech since he assumed power in October 1999.
The commentator says the Pakistan president was not defensive at all while taking on India or defending Pakistan's stand on Kashmir and terrorism.
However, in the paper's editorial condemns war of any sort, and also criticises Pakistan's foreign policy.
The editorial stresses the need for more international support.
Formal requests about how many signatures are needed for any petitions submitted for Barnet, Birmingham, Kingston-upon-Thames and Ripon by July 31 to trigger a ballot have been received by the ballot administration company dealing with the issue.
But in a Commons written reply on Thursday, School Standards Minister Estelle Morris added that no ballots, in which parents will vote, had yet taken place.
Many of the 166 remaining English grammar schools are concerned about their futures, and have warned that ballot results going against them will lead to chaotic school reorganisations and the destruction of long-established sixth forms.
Horse trader James Gray, 45, and his son James Gray Junior, 16, were found guilty of 11 charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
His wife Julie Gray, 41, and daughters Jodie, 26, and Cordelia, 20, were each found guilty of two charges.
Bicester Magistrates' Court heard RSPCA staff and vets removed 115 animals from Spindle Farm in Amersham last January.
One dead horse was found on the back of a trailer with ropes around its tail, the court heard.
The court heard many horses living at the farm were found surrounded by rotting corpses of other animals which had been left to die of starvation.
RSPCA chief inspector Rob Skinner said he found 32 carcasses in different locations on the farm when he went to look round in January last year.
Some of these had been dumped on a bonfire while others were left lying on the ground, covered in rubbish, the court heard.
Nick White, a field officer for international horse charity World Horse Welfare, was one of the first at the scene.
The court heard one pony was unable to stand and had to be rolled over so vets could examine it.
A vet examined the animal and decided it should be put down immediately.
James Gray Senior told the court it was common for horses to "drop down dead" and said some animals found on his land had died without warning or displaying any sign of illness.
He said some corpses, which were left lying on his property for several days, were "family pets" which he was waiting to bury.
Norfolk-based horse charity Redwings helped remove 80 animals from the farm and brought back 21 to its own care.
James Gray Senior, who has a previous conviction for causing unnecessary suffering to a horse, will be sentenced along with the four other members of his family on 12 June.

Andrew Osborne, 31, of Lighthorne Heath, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, is said to have been clocked by a speed camera doing 157 mph on adual-carriageway in Buckinghamshire.
He was charged alongside fellow motorcyclist Neil Bolger, 31, of St Marks Close, Gaydon, Warwickshire, who is accused of recording a speed of 148 mph.
Both offences are alleged to have happened on the same stretch of road, the A421 Tingewick bypass near Buckingham.
Aylesbury Magistrates Court heard on Tuesday how Mr Osborne was riding his 1200cc Kawasaki bike and Bolger was on his 750cc Kawasaki in March this year.
Both were charged with driving at a speed in excess of 70 mph and of driving in a dangerous manner.
The case was adjourned until 17 June for video footage to be examined by technical experts.
The driver convicted of driving at the highest speed in the UK is thought to be Daniel Nicks, who filmed himself at 175 mph in Buckinghamshire on his motorcycle in 2000.
The site dealt with more than 10m calls from across the country last year and that number is expected to increase to more than 17m a year.
The expansion of the workforce follows a successful application for a Scottish Government grant.
In 2007, more than 400 jobs were lost in Dundee when Tesco abandoned its distribution centre in the city and relocated work to Livingston.

He will face his former club for the first time since leaving in 2003 when AC Milan host United on 16 February.
The midfielder, who is on loan at Milan from LA Galaxy, still remembers and appreciates the support given to him by United fans after he was sent off while playing for England against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup.
Beckham played 394 times for United over eight seasons, helping the club win six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions league.
"Coming to terms with not being a United player was certainly the toughest thing I've ever had to deal with.
"When you are a Manchester United player and a Manchester United fan you never want to play for any other club.
Beckham will go back to Old Trafford for the first time as a player when Milan travel to Manchester for the second leg of their Champions League clash on 10 March.
McClaren dropped Beckham after the 2006 World Cup, before recently recalling the former England captain.
"It felt as if there was no way back," Beckham told ITV show New Beginnings.
McClaren recalled Beckham for the friendly game against Brazil and the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia and the former England captain played well in both games.
The LA Galaxy midfielder set up John Terry's goal in his comeback match against Brazil, and then set up two more in England's Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia.
Beckham said he was close to tears after the phone call to McClaren ended.
"At first it wasn't a case of proving him wrong, because I had to come to terms with what had been said and be patient," added Beckham.
"But after maybe a day or two and speaking to my friends and my family, then it was a case of 'OK, this is the situation, now how do I get myself out of it?'
Beckham made his debut for Los Angeles Galaxy when he came on as a substitute for the last 12 minutes of his club's 1-0 defeat by Chelsea over the weekend.
But, as had been expected, he was ruled out of the Galaxy's 2-1 SuperLiga win against Mexican side Pachuca on Tuesday.
The SuperLiga is an eight-team competition featuring four MLS sides from the US and four teams from the Mexican first division.
Tevez headed in a corner at the near post after Shaun Wright-Phillips had opened the scoring with a crisp shot from a Stephen Ireland through-ball.
Palace more than matched City in the first half, with 19-year-old striker Freddie Sears going close three times.
But City were totally dominant in the second period, as Joleon Lescott marked his debut with a clean sheet.
City boss Mark Hughes sprung a surprise before kick-off by naming his strongest possible line-up, perhaps a signal of his intent to end the club's 33-year trophy drought.
He was rewarded with a fluent display with several signs that City's expensively assembled forward line may be starting to gel.
Tevez missed a great chance in the third minute, firing wide after smart work from Robinho and Emmanuel Adebayor.
Brazil's Robinho had a goal disallowed for offside after 15 minutes, although replays showed he was in his own half when the ball was played.
Victor Moses wasted a good chance to get Palace back in the game, firing high and wide when presented with a clear shot on goal.
City's place in the third round was secured with 20 minutes remaining when a Wright-Phillips corner flicked off a Palace player to the unmarked Tevez, who nodded home from three yards.
Craig Bellamy made a late appearance as City closed out the game with ease, but on this evidence the Welshman will struggle to break into Hughes's nicely blossoming forward line.
"The team Mark put out was a great tribute to us and I'm very proud of the way we played.
"I brought my son tonight because he wanted to see Adebayor - I told him he wouldn't get a kick and I was right!"

World governing body the FIA has given Fota members until 19 June to accept new rules and a budget cap or risk exclusion from the 2010 season.
On Wednesday Fota wrote to Mosley suggesting an extension for more talks.
But he insists Friday remains the cut-off date for teams like McLaren and Ferrari who have yet to sign up.
Autosport magazine reports that Mosley has told teams that he is prepared to discuss the FIA's International Court of Appeal, and also remove the controversial appendix five to the 2010 Sporting Regulations.
This has been a particularly thorny issue for teams, who are concerned it would give the FIA a free hand to impose whatever rules they wanted.
In addition, he is also thought to be willing to change some of the technical regulations for next year.
If the teams agree, rules on moveable wings will remain as they are this year, four wheel drive cars will not be allowed, tyre warmers will still be allowed and rules relating to engines, gearboxes and testing limitations will stay as they are at the moment.
Of the teams on the 2009 F1 grid, so far only Williams and Force India have definitely signed up for next year, as a result of which they were suspended from Fota.
Earlier this month, all 10 current F1 teams were included on the list of entrants for next season, although five of them - Brawn GP, McLaren, Renault, Toyota and BMW Sauber - were only provisional entries, and Ferrari insisted they would not enter under the proposed rules.
Three new teams - Campos Grand Prix, Manor and US F1 - have also signed up.
If the two sides are unable to reach an agreement by the deadline, the FIA has confirmed more new entrants will be named to make up the 13-team, 26-car grid.
They would essentially replace some of the biggest names in the sport's history - a prospect that does not appeal to some of the current leading drivers, who have already spoken in favour of potentially taking part in a breakaway rival championship.
The Fota letter, sent on Wednesday, is addressed to FIA president Mosley - the driving force behind a £40m per team per season budget cap - and F1's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone.
"We hope that you will consider that this letter represents significant movement by the teams, all of whom have clearly stated a willingness to commit to the sport until the end of 2012," it said.
"We would therefore strongly but respectfully submit that you consider these proposals and seek to avoid the potential departure from F1 of some important teams.
The FIA wants to introduce budgetary restrictions to "ensure that F1 is the most technologically challenging motorsport".
It has accused Fota members of wanting to take over the running of the sport.
"The FIA and FOM (Formula One Management) have together spent decades building the FIA Formula 1 World Championship into the most watched motorsport competition in history," said the FIA.
The teams have expressed concern that the way the rules would be enforced would be intrusive on the running of their business, but the FIA rejects this suggestion.
"If there is no intention to cheat, regulation should not present a threat," it said.
"The FIA already regulates every aspect of technical performance and deals with vast amounts of confidential proprietary technical information without partiality or 'interference'.
"For several of the existing teams, the idea of greater technical freedom with financial constraints was very attractive.
Not wanting to disappoint, Mr Worley, 60, played along with some "ho-ho-hos".
Even after bowing to the request to alter his appearance, Mr Worley, from Tampa, said children continued to ask if he was Santa.
"How do you tell a little kid, 'No, go away, little kid'," Mr Worley told local television.
He said Disney had told him "Santa was considered a Disney character".
Officials at Disney World's Epcot park said they had had complaints from "several guests who were very upset".
Disney said it had its own Santa at Epcot and Mr Worley was "confusing" the children.
Mr Worley said he had played a jolly elf at charity events for a number of years, while his wife sometimes dressed up as Mrs Claus.
Mr Worley said he still loved Disney and Christmas.
US companies are hoping that now he has won control of Congress he will be able to implement the pro-business agenda he promised when he was first elected in 2000, but was subsequently blocked when he lost control of the Senate in June 2001.
Especially happy are executives in the oil and gas industry, who are hoping for permission to drill in the Alaska nature reserve, and the bosses of the pharmaceutical industry, who have been fighting proposals for a prescription drug benefit to be included in Medicare, the US government health insurance scheme for elderly people.
Lawyers, on the other hand, are likely to be disappointed.
One of Mr Bush's key corporate pledges was "tort reform" - making it harder for individuals to sue companies for civil damages in so-called "class action" suits.
This should especially help the tobacco industry, which has been facing a series of multi-billion dollar lawsuits despite its $269bn settlement with the states in 2000.
Another industry that will gain strongly is the defence sector, which is set to benefit from Mr Bush's plans for a possible war in Iraq.
Defence procurement, especially of unmanned aircraft, is set to grow sharply as the US defence budget rises by nearly $50bn this year - benefiting firms like Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman.
However, all businesses will benefit from a big tax cut that the Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, has long desired.
Mr O'Neill, and most of the Bush economic team, believe that by abolishing the taxation of corporate earnings, they will stimulate the economy so much that government tax revenue will actually rise.
The cuts will especially be aimed at benefiting small businesses, who also now can pass on all their property to their heirs without having to pay any inheritance tax at all.
Mr Bush has been in the firing line over a series of corporate scandals, such as Enron and WorldCom, where chief executives deceived their shareholders while receiving huge salary bonuses and share options.
Mr Bush has promised to crack down on corporate fraud, saying that the only place for fraudsters is jail.
But his actions so far have not matched his words.
The resignation now provides a test of Mr Bush's real desire for cleaning up corporate corruption.
A tough appointment would prove he was serious, but if he appoints another figure close to the accountancy industry it will raise questions about his real commitment to reform.
In the longer term, US pharmaceutical companies are likely to win the Medicare battle over who should pay for prescription costs.
After Mr Bush's victory it is looking likely that Mr Bush's plan to encourage private insurance companies to provide coverage of expensive prescription medicines will go through.
Mr Bush is likely to get his way, defeating a Democratic proposal to extend US government health benefits for the elderly to cover drugs, which drug companies feared would lead to a cap on prices.
And looking ahead, investment firms could benefit if Mr Bush succeeds in his plan to partly privatise the state pension system, known as Social Security.
He wants individuals to be given the right to put some of their contributions in private stock market funds instead, which could add billions to the funds handled by banks and mutual funds.
All in all the mid-term elections were not only a triumph for President Bush, his victory could be fruitful for companies too.
The time has come to unleash Pop Idol runner-up Gareth Gates on to the public.
After the runaway success of Will Young's single, record label BMG must be laughing all the way to the bank as it is certain to have another till-ringing hit on its hands.
Gates has done a cover of the Righteous Brothers classic Unchained Melody - but then who hasn't.
There is little to separate this from any other version of the karaoke favourite, although it inches past Robson and Jerome's effort.
You can hear Gates' boy-band-style voice but at times it gets lost as he is forced to go too deep for his range.
This is a big production and the orchestra has a tendency to drown him out, almost taking over and resigning Gates to the background.
The track seems an odd choice for a pop idol as this is hardly a pop number, just a classic ballad designed to tug at the heart strings.
And because it is such a well-known and loved track it is hard for Gates to stamp his own mark on it.
Although it looks set for a prolonged stay at the top of the charts, Gates' version does not have the class to overtake the Righteous Brothers as the true masters of Unchained Melody.
As a consequence both have been forced to record songs that do little justice to their distinctly different voices.
We can only hope record company bosses put more thought and effort into their second singles, giving them a real platform to showcase their obviously huge talents.
The pictures were taken by the Galileo probe in May and are the highest resolution view yet seen of any of Jupiter's moons.
They show a spiky landscape of bright ice and dark dust with signs of slow but active surface erosion.
There is no clear evidence that Callisto has experienced the volcanic activity or tectonic shifting that have erased some or all of the impact craters on Jupiter's other three large moons, Nasa says.
The close-up images show craters as small as about three meters (10 feet) across.
Image analysts are counting the craters as a means to estimate Callisto's age and compare their calculations with those for other moons of Jupiter.
Aftermath of bomb explosion in Kabul
Five embassy personnel were killed - India's defence attache, a senior diplomat and two security guards - as well as an Afghan man.
Five Afghans died at Indonesia's embassy nearby.
No-one has admitted being behind the attack, the deadliest in Kabul since the overthrow of the Taleban in 2001.
Afghanistan has seen a sharp increase in violence, particularly in the south and east - and Taleban militants recently vowed to step up their attacks in the capital.
But the latest blast - in what was supposed to be a secure area of Kabul - will greatly concern Afghan government officials, says the BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai said the attackers wanted to rupture good relations between Afghanistan and India, while the Afghan interior ministry said it believed the attack was carried out "in co-ordination and consultation with an active intelligence service in the region".
In a statement, Pakistan's foreign minister said his country "condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations".
India also condemned the "cowardly terrorists' attack", but vowed it would not be deterred from fulfilling its commitment to the government and people of Afghanistan.
India has close ties with Afghanistan and is involved in aid and reconstruction work, including the building of Afghanistan's new parliament.
The US condemned the "needless act of violence", as did the European Union, which described it as a "terrorist attack targeting innocent civilians".
The United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that "in no culture, no country, and no religion is there any excuse or justification for such acts".
The bomb exploded as people were queuing for visas at the embassy.
Ali Hassan Fahimi said shrapnel had landed in his office, which is close to the site of the blast.
A spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry, Gen Zaher Azimi, told the BBC the attack was "the deadliest since the fall of Taleban" in Kabul.
Another Afghan government spokesman, Zamari Bashari, told the BBC he thought the embassy had been attacked because of India's involvement in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
He said that the terrorist enemies of Afghanistan wanted such work to stop.
Afghan Foreign Minister Rangeen Dadfar Spanta visited the Indian embassy shortly after the attack, his spokesman said.
Sites across the valleys and north and west Wales could benefit from the European and assembly government money.
By developing trails and events at heritage sites, it is hoped communities around them will benefit economically from the tourists attracted.
Heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones said he welcomed the investment in tourism.
Cadw, the government agency set up to protect the historical heritage of Wales, will work with communities, heritage partners and the tourism sector to develop a more integrated range of tours, trails and packages at heritage sites.
It is hoped this will provide benefit beyond individual sites because it will help visitors explore the surrounding towns and countryside.
Sites set to benefit include Harlech, Denbigh and Conwy castles in the north as well as attractions in west Wales and the valleys such as Oystermouth castle in the Mumbles, Swansea.
Councillor Chris Holley, Swansea council leader, said extra funding would help conserve the castle for future generations and boost visitor numbers.
"Many thousands more people will soon be discovering the mystique and magic of Oystermouth Castle," he said.
On Anglesey, the council, Cadw and enterprise agency Menter Môn are working to promote the island as a heritage tourism destination.
Heritage minister Alun Ffred Jones said he looked forward to seeing the projects and partnerships develop in the years ahead.

The symptoms of burnout can be physical, mental and/or emotional.
Burnout can happen if excessively high expectations are placed on a child by parents or coaches and they are pushed too hard too quickly.
Children who go all out in their sport and neglect other areas of their life, like schoolwork, may also fall foul.
The symptoms can be confusing for parents but being aware of them is important because the severe cases can lead to clinical depression.
Rest and relaxation is the best cure and talking about any problems is also a good way of improving things.
You won't have all the answers but just understanding the problems will be a help.
"It is disappointing and in such circumstances one is compelled to think about leaving the game altogether.
"I am very disheartened because I have tried hard to remove any defects in my action," the 29-year-old commented.
The Pakistan Cricket Board is currently considering an appeal, and officials are due to meet Shabbir on Thursday.
"The board knows better what to do - they will decide.
"For my part, I don't know what next course of action to adopt," he said.
Shabbir's action was reported for the second time during the opening match of the recent Test series against England.
And biomechanics experts at the University of Western Australia concluded he does on occasions straighten his elbow beyond the 15 degree limit permitted under International Cricket Council regulations.
Shabbir has played 10 Tests and 32 one-day internationals and the PCB has vowed to provide whatever help is required to enable him to iron out the problem with his action.
The ICC believes a suspension from international cricket was the appropriate step in this case.
"It is clear that Mr Ahmed has the capacity to bowl with a legal action but that on occasion he has the tendency to revert to old habits.
"A suspension for 12 months provides him with the opportunity to permanently address the concerns that have been identified," said chief executive Malcolm Speed.
England captain Nasser Hussain, who may well have been repeating Border's words to himself at Perth, said after losing the Ashes that he wants to learn from Australia.
He could do worse than study Border, who has been credited with dragging Australia from the dark days of the 1980s.
England have made progress in the last three years with Hussain and coach Duncan Fletcher instilling a positive team spirit and morale in the side.
They have increased the number of central contracts to 20 to protect those players from the rigours of the county circuit in between Test matches.
And a chief medical officer has been appointed in response to a crippling injury list that threatens to undo much of Hussain and Fletcher's good work.
Cricket in England is finally being dragged into the modern era after some kicking and screaming, but more than 10 years after Australia blazed the trail.
Copying the Australian blueprint is a start, but England desperately need to introduce some of their own innovations if they are to live up to their ambition of producing the world's best Test and one-day sides by 2007.
South Africa embraced the same ideas years ago, and have carved a niche as the world's second best team.
But the thrashing they took against Australia last winter highlighted the gulf that still exists between the two sides.
Hussain certainly believes that there are deeper issues to be examined in England.
"You've got to ask the question that if we're ever going to compete with Australia, how we are going to do it?
"What do we do wrong in our cricket at home, in our lifestyle, the whole thing?
"You can't just put the blame on county cricket, it's a lot deeper than that," he said in Perth.
A period of soul searching will inevitably follow the debacle Down Under.
The question remains whether the errors can be rectified and the improvements that will specifically drive the England team forwards can be identified.
And if Hussain or any other captain is to lead England Border-style out of their trough of despair, they will need a strong and committed management team to put the ideas into practice.
David Coulthard has always had an ambivalent relationship with the public.
Despite being Britain's top Grand Prix driver for five years now, he isonly just beginning to be appreciated as such in the general consciousness.
Perhaps it's because he is Scottish, and the media English-dominated.
Or perhaps it is because he has spent the last few years in the shadow of his McLaren team-mate Mika Hakkinen and Ferrari star Michael Schumacher.
Either way, he has never drawn the sort of adulationthat used to be lavished on his predecessors, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill - and he doesn't really care.
It is no surprise, then, that Coulthard says he feels no special emotion about Silverstone this weekend - even if, should he win, he would become only the second driver in history to win three British Grands Prix in a row.
"I want to win it because to do so would help me in the championship.
These are not, as he acknowledges, the sort of remarks that will set the public's patriotism ablaze.
But then Coulthard has always been a matter-of-fact sort of man, with a nice line in dry, self-deprecating humour.
He uses this to illustrate an example of his double-edged relationship with the British public, which he experienced at a historic racing car event at Goodwood last weekend.
There are not many international sports stars who would tell such a story against themselves - and find it funny.
But Coulthard has always been an unusually well-grounded racing driver, with his sense of his own importance fully under control.
He was never particularly bothered about the fact that he did not get much coverage in the press.
He was much more concerned about doing his job, and was quite happy to be left relatively alone.
This year, though, he has become something of a star in the newspapers, if not always for the reasons he would have wanted.
An unfortunate corollary of his rise to prominence on the track has been the interest of the tabloid press in his activities off it.
The newspapers latched on to his split from fiancee Heidi Wichlinski before the start of the season, and have wallowed since in a series of stories about his supposed antics with a series of beautiful women ever since.
"It was frustrating and embarrassing for all parties for it to be suggested that a night of romping around in a hotel was the downfall of a four-year relationship.
"You either go public, which I don't want to do, or you just ride it out.
Some will think, 'Oh, it must be true,' and others close to you know it's not.
And fame off the track, now that he has established himself on it as a genuine world title contender, is something he will doubtless have to get used to.
"Liberian politicians call people 'the masses' when they are still seeking their votes, but once they are elected, they will remove the 'm' from the masses and call them 'the asses'," says James Murray, a company messenger amidst the frantic election campaigning.
This scepticism of the political establishment stems from more than 150 years ofchronic bad governance, corruption, ethnic exploitation - and an infrastructure andeconomy ruined by 14 years of civil war.
The guns may now be silent, and refugees returning to their homes following the 2003 peace deal which saw former President Charles Taylor exit to Nigeria and the arrival of some 15,000 United Nations peacekeepers, but Liberians are frustrated with their lot.
"I feel ashamed when foreigners come here saying Liberia is the largest and darkest village in Africa," says Charles Cooper, a Monrovia shopkeeper.
To say the task that lies ahead for the president voted into State House in January is enormous is an understatement.
Re-plastering pockmarked buildings, switching on electricity, reconnecting water, improving rural sanitation, getting buses on roads, halting the exodus of teachers to organisations that pay them, buying school textbooks and stamping out rampant corruption are only some of the challenges.
And Liberia's battle scars are as emotional as they are physical.
Until Samuel Doe's coup in 1980, power in Liberia had always been in the hands of the Americo-Liberians - the descendents of freed African slaves from America, who had ruled the country since independence in 1847.
These early settlers did not believe in educating the less privileged, indigenouspopulace, wanting to keep them firmly under their thumb and power firmly withintheir grasp.
It is a policy which reverberates to this day, with an illiteracy rate of 80% - blamed for much of the political unrest.
According to aid worker Massa Konneh, who works at a displacement camp outsideMonrovia, the resentment between the haves and have-nots in Liberia was starkly illustrated during the civil war.
The country is awash with some 106,000 ex-combatants, disarmed by the UN, who have yet to come to terms with living without guns.
Communities who bore the brunt of the fighting are hoping the new government will not only introduce rehabilitation and integration programmes for the former fighters but send them to school.
"Disowning the former fighters or distancing oneself from them will not solve the problems," says trader Marie Whetie.
But in the eyes of the international community, corruption - which engulfed the transitionaladministration of Gyude Bryant - is a major stumbling block to tackling poverty.
"The low level of transparency and accountability and good governance inLiberia is troubling and represents a real threat to the economic, social and political reconstruction of Liberia," outgoing US Ambassador John William Blaney said.
He was characteristically candid about what he saw as the failure of Mr Bryant's team to tackle the issue, and warned that Washington would consider imposing travel bans and freezing the assets of those caught with their hands in the till.
"If Liberia is to stay on course and keep the confidence of its friends in the international community, it must move further against corruption," Mr Blaney said.
Despite these challenges, there is an air of optimism that Liberia is finally on the road to peace, partly fostered by the presence of UN blue helmets.
Every political twist and turn is hotly debated and presidential aspirants'credentials critically analysed - on street corners, in taxis, at work andin bars.
There is no escaping the fact that Liberians are demanding thatfor once politicians live up to their words.
"After all this killing and destructionthere must be a government that is focused and straightforward,"says Massa Konneh.
President Yoweri Museveni's main rival in next week's elections said the violence was part of a military campaign to intimidate his supporters.
Uganda's police chief has apologised but also partly blamed opposition supporters for the incident.
Two men believed to be state security agents are being held by police.
In an interview with the BBC's Will Ross in Kampala, Dr Besigye called on his supporters "to use maximum restraint" and "to only do what is necessary to defend themselves".
The opposition leader has asked his supporters "not to retaliate" and "not to escalate the violence".
However, Dr Besigye believes that the authorities have been trying to frighten the country's voters ahead of next week's poll.
Wednesday shooting is "consistent with the terror campaign aimed at causing despondency within the population so that the population resigns and says we better keep Museveni or we get finished", he said.
The incident happened in Kampala after supporters were celebrating the adjournment of Dr Besigye's treason trial until after next week's presidential poll.
Dr Besigye's election campaign has been frequently interrupted by court appearances.
He is accused by the state of plotting a rebellion to overthrow the government, but he says the charges against him are politically motivated.
Compared to elections five years ago, the electoral campaigns have been relatively peaceful.
But our correspondent says Wednesday's shooting is likely to raise tension in an election which has been bitterly fought.
President Museveni, who came to power 20 years ago, is viewed as the favourite to win.
These are the first multiparty elections for 26 years, but have been marred by the controversy surrounding the arrest of President Museveni's rival.
A spokesperson said a "limited level" of ads would be "a very viable option".
Before that, proposals will go through the BBC's internal journalism board and executive direction group.
But it will not be subject to the public value test, which will ensure the BBC's non-commercial ventures do not adversely affect commercial markets in the UK.
"Our hope would be to have the site fully up and running in a year's time," the spokesperson continued.
TV news channel BBC World, which is broadcast outside the UK, carries adverts and could be used as a model.
It is also hoped that in due course, the site will offer direct consumer downloads via the proposed Integrated Media Player, or iMP.
"At a later date it might become a portal for video on demand for international users," the BBC Worldwide spokesperson said.
iMP is an application in development offering UK viewers the chance to download TV and radio programmes they may have missed for up to seven days after they have been broadcast.
Often able to stop work relatively early and enjoy a pretty comfortable retirement as well.
Lord Turner spent three long years coming up with the answer.
The expansion is on wasteland at the existing site within the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Didcot.
It will allow cold, or low energy, neutrons to be produced, enabling scientists from all over the world to probe the structure and dynamics of matter.
A new range of technological applications are envisaged, from super-fast computers, data storage and sensors to pharmaceuticals.
"We're able to see where atoms are and what they do," Professor Jeff Penfold, project scientist for the new wing, told BBC News Online.
It is one of the largest ever awards of government funding for a single science project.
A second target station is needed to meet the needs of research and industry.
The existing facility hosts 500 academic groups a year and cannot expand any further.
Building work is expected to start in the next few weeks and should be finished by the end of 2007.
The 300m-wide (980ft) rock, known as Apophis, will fly past Earth in April 2029 at a distance that is closer than many communications satellites.
Astrium, based in Stevenage, Herts, wants a probe to track the asteroid so its orbit can be better understood.
The concept will compete for a $50,000 (�25,000) Planetary Society prize, but a full mission would cost millions.
The British design calls for a small, remote-sensing spacecraft, dubbed Apex (Apophis Explorer), which could rendezvous with Apophis in January 2014.
It would then spend the next three years tracking the rock, sending data back to Earth about the object's size, shape, spin, composition and temperature.
From this information, orbit modelling would enable a more accurate prediction of the risk of any future collision.
Astrium says that if its concept won the prize, it would donate the money to charity.
"The real prize for us would be if the European or US space agencies thought there was merit in our proposal and asked us to carry the feasibility study forward," said Dr Mike Healy, the company's space science director.
A full mission would be expected to cost about $500m (�250m) dollars to develop, launch and operate.
Apophis caused some consternation in 2004 when initial observations suggested there was an outside chance it might hit Earth in 2029.
Further study by ground-based telescopes indicated there was virtually no possibility of this happening, and the expectation is that the object will whiz past the Earth at a close but comfortable distance of just under 36,000km (22,400 miles).
However, there is always some uncertainty associated with an asteroid's orbit.
The close encounter with Earth in 2029 will also perturb Apophis' orbit gravitationally.
A mission like Apex to track and study the rock would help reduce uncertainties and give solid predictions about the rock's course long into the future.
At the moment, scientists stress Apophis is not thought to be a serious danger to Earth.
But were such a rock to hit the planet, it could cause devastation on a country-wide scale, leading possibly to the deaths of many millions of people.
Given sufficient warning, though, a potential impactor could be deflected out of Earth's path, scientists believe.
The issue of asteroid or comet strikes is a topical one as researchers continue to gather more information about their frequency during Earth history.
At least one of the planet's mass extinction events - which included the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - has been attributed to the impact of a large space object.
The US-based Planetary Society has organised its competition in co-operation with the European Space Agency (Esa), the US space agency (Nasa), the Association of Space Explorers (ASE), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA).
The winning entry will be submitted to space agencies to see if they want to carry the ideas through.
And he has admitted that the woman who has made allegations of sexual assault against former Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife, Christine, came to him for advice.
In the last few years alone he has helped expose Jeffrey Archer and liaised with the media over the story of Siamese twins Jodie and Mary.
Sophie Wessex - herself a public relations businesswoman - has been on the receiving end of his professional attentions.
And while he is a Labour supporter and an admirer of Tony Blair, this did not stop him tipping off the Mirror that Cherie was pregnant.
But Mr Clifford is a much more complex character than justa purveyor of sleaze, as many of his victims have branded him.
While he makes a very good living for his business, what motivates him is much more than just money.
He cannot stand hypocrisy in public life, and reserves a particular disgust for lying politicians.
And bringing up a disabled child - his only daughter Lousie, who has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since childhood - is also a motivating factor behind many of his decisions.
Although he does not criticise the NHS treatment she has received, he says he has watched with growing anger at what has happened to the health service over the past 20 years.
He blames much of this on the Conservatives and for a long time his targets tended to be Tories.
Now they can be Labour as well - Ron Davies's adventures on Clapham Common was another Clifford exclusive.
He says that while he has broken scandals on politicians, he could have broken 30 or 40 more, but held back because he did not think what they were doing was wrong.
And he sometimes works for free as in the case of a contestant on gameshow the Weakest Link who turned out to be a call girl.
Despite these acts, there still remains an arbitrary nature to his decisions.
However he stands by his principles and while he is hated by some, he says he is happy with his career.
This has not prevented him sometimes being the victim of more than just verbal attacks about the way he makes his living.
He received death threats demanding he axe links with the five men who were suspected of the killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
He said he had not represented them, but had merely put them in touch with ITV interviewer Martin Bashir.
He also received death threats when he represented OJ Simpson.
Public relations has never been such a risky business but when Max Clifford is involved the stakes are often high.
Researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield have been examining the way our brains interpret our senses.
They connected artificial mouse whiskers to a robotic brain to see how the brain processes information relayed by sense of touch.
The research could lead to the creation of prosthetic limbs able to feel.
The scientists found that when objects were brushed against the whiskers, the robot brain learned how to interpret the whisker movement according to its direction, mimicking the function of how a real brain understands the sensations of touch.
Researchers were able to build profiles of whisker movements and their corresponding brain functions to create a clearer picture of how the brain learns about touch, which will be helpful for robot design.
The study adds evidence to support the theory that the brain learns to understand signals from the senses through experience, and suggests that interpreting touch is not simply instinctive.
Scientists hope to expand on the findings by investigating how the brain interprets the shapes of objects with which the body comes into contact.
The study, funded by the European Union, was presented at the Society for Neuroscience conference in Chicago.
The company wants to move its Irish Sea services out of Stranraer and along the coast to Old House Point at Cairnryan.
Route director Alan Gordon said in the company's "best case" scenario the new terminal could be built by 2010.
Stena Line has to meet a number of requirements before the move can progress.
The company must submit an environmental impact assessment (EIA ) and seek a harbour empowerment order (HEO) from the Scottish Government.
A period of public consultation on its plans would then follow.
Mr Gordon said it was hoped that process could get under way soon.
"We would hope within the next four weeks to be able to submit the EIA and HEO," he said.
"Then it depends what objections come in whether there is a public inquiry, a hearing or written correspondence.
He said that in the best case the new facility could be built by 2010 or, in the worst case, a year later.
Plans were ditched last year for a combined ferry terminal development between Stena Line and P&O in the area.
An HEO had already been granted for that proposal but it was decided it was "no longer economically viable".
Stena Line now looks set to go it alone with the new proposals.
News of the proposed £150m Super Halal Industrial Park (SHIP) was revealed at an Islamic finance summit in London.
Mahesh Jayanarayan, chairman of Halal Industries, said Wales was chosen as the project's site for its meat industries and affordable land prices.
The assembly government said they were "tenative proposals" and and it would work closely with the firm.
The firm, a private equity company, said it was raising funds for the venture, which could launch in three to five years.
Mr Jayanarayan told the Reuters Islamic Banking and Finance Summit that Europe has no Halal industrial parks, despite being home to millions of Muslims.
Halal is an Arabic term meaning "permissible" and while it is often associated with meat, it refers to anything that is permissible in the Islamic faith.
The industrial park could create up to 3,000 jobs and would make the UK a landmark Halal centre for the region, Mr Jayanarayan told the finance summit.
"This halal market is not going away, it is not some fad.
Halal park plan for south Wales
He said a successful first project in the UK could lead to others across Europe - possibly in France, Germany and other parts of Europe.
Halal Industries is getting advisory and development support throughout the project from Penang International Halal Hub (PIHH), the agency set up for the development of Halal industries in Malaysia.
The cost of the project will be £150m and Mr Jayanarayan said he plans to raise the fund in the capital markets, through government grants, and by finding partners like supermarket chains and multinational food manufacturers to "cement the deal".
"However, these are clearly tentative proposals at their very early stages of development.
My family fled Afghanistan in 1993, first moving to Russia and then settling in London over a decade ago.
As a budding journalist living here in London, I see that there is hardly a day that does not involve Afghanistan in the headlines.
But when I look at my country's representation in the media I find the stories are mainly about extreme groups, poppy fields and women's rights and all this shapes the views of Afghans to the rest of the world.
When I am confronted with the widely accepted negative view of my homeland I feel responsible to point out the positives, pointing out that Afghanistan was not as we know it today before the war, it was progressive, open minded and developed.
Today I am proud to add Rohullah Nikpai's achievements to the list to show that we are heading in the right direction.
I think it is important that positives are shown despite the negatives, I am worried that the negatives will become a stable view of Afghanistan and it may turn into a barrier between the future generations and success.
Nikpai's achievements are a ray of hope not only to shine the country's name within the sports competitions but also to present Afghanistan in the positive light to the world.
Afghans should be able to that pick up from where they left off before the war and move the country to become the centre of culture, civilization and ultimately become an inspiration for others.
Nikpai's athletic journey is also an example of fighting against all odds and achieving your dreams despite all the hardship faced.
And I know he's a great role-model to inspire young Afghans, including my siblings and me.
I hope other Afghans follow his footsteps and move forward with their dreams, the more similar achievements are reported the easier it will become for the world to accept Afghanistan without prejudice and the easier it is going to be for the Afghans to reunite and trust one another.
It is not just a matter of sports and medals it is a starting point of a renewed society and I hope that the Afghan women do not fall behind and instead start breaking the barriers to step into the world.
That's why I'm so committed to following my dreams to be a journalist so I can make my own contribution.
But for now, like all other Afghans around the world me and my family are very proud of his achievements and will support him in his efforts in future, and I hope I can be part of greeting Nikpai in London when he arrives for the Olympics here in 2012.
Michael Owen announces himself on the world stage at the age of 18 with a wonder goal against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup in France.
The day's only other National Hunt meeting, at Ludlow, had already fallen victim to the cold weather.
Doncaster track manager Malcolm Taylor said he had no choice but to call off the fixture following a 0730 inspection.
"The course is still frozen and temperatures have fallen since midnight which you would not tend to expect," he said.
Both of Tuesday's jump fixtures - at Sedgefield and Folkestone - were also lost, as was Monday's card at Carlisle.
Meanwhile, the British Horseracing Board have announced that three additional jumping meetings will take place next Sunday.
The new cards will be at Ayr, Exeter and Hereford, with more replacement fixtures due to be announced in the coming weeks.
Supermodel Laetitia Casta, famed as the "face of France" is to stretch the imagination of her French fans by playing a melancholic Parisian prostitute in a film.
Yet few of her fellow countrymen seem bothered by the fact that the woman who is supposed to symbolise the Gallic nation should have taken such a role.
Casta was chosen in 1999 as the model for the bust of Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic which stands outside town halls nationwide.
Her face appears on French stamps, adorned French franc coins, and now figures on some of the French euro coins.
But Casta's latest role will see her starring in Rue des Plaisirs (Street of Pleasures) by veteran French director Patrice Leconte.
It tells the story of a brothel in Paris in 1945 just after the city's liberation from German occupation.
But the prince turns out to be a villain.
So far no prominent Frenchman or woman has stood up to denounce Casta's latest casting.
And ordinary folk in the streets of Paris say they see no harm in the symbol of their country playing a hooker.
Deneuve, for example, was cast in Luis Bunuel's Belle de Jour as a bored, bourgeois housewife who spent her afternoons working in a high-class whorehouse for kicks.
Casta is no stranger to scandal.
Most recently the 23-year-old supermodel came under fire from an environmental group for appearing in an advertisement which shows her reclining in a bowl of caviar.
The 36,000 members of the French Association of Mayors, who chose Casta as a figurehead, were asked if they wanted to keep her as their model.
Casta's earlier film credits include Asterix, based on the popular comic book about the Gallic hero of the same name, in which she starred alongside Gerard Depardieu.
The implants are paid for by male "benefactors" who, for a fee, can access the women's personal profiles, pictures and contact details.
Myfreeimplants claims any woman over 18 is eligible to join for surgery.
The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says this is frightening and potentially dangerous.
It is urging women not to use the service, after learning of UK women who have joined the US website.
One British woman listed on the website who calls herself Morgan claims to have raised �3,700 from benefactors for her E-cup surgery.
"All we do is pay the doctor once the women has reached her goal and been determined fit for surgery.
Alberto Fernandez made the remarks during an interview with Arabic television station al-Jazeera.
The state department says Mr Fernandez was quoted incorrectly - but BBC Arabic language experts say Mr Fernandez did indeed use the words.
It comes after President George W Bush discussed changing tactics with top US commanders to try to combat the unrest.
Mr Fernandez, an Arabic speaker who is director of public diplomacy in the state department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, told Qatar-based al-Jazeera that the world was "witnessing failure in Iraq".
"That's not the failure of the United States alone, but it is a disaster for the region," he said.
He also said that the US was now willing to speak to any insurgent group except al-Qaeda in an effort to reduce sectarian bloodshed in Iraq.
Mr McCormack also denied that the US had been guilty of arrogance or stupidity saying that history would be the judge of US actions in Iraq.
Mr Fernandez's comments came after Mr Bush said that US troops were changing tactics to deal with the insurgency in Iraq.
Mr Bush held a video conference on the new measures with top US military commanders in Iraq on Saturday against the backdrop of more US losses in Iraq - 78 so far this month.
A new poll suggests two-thirds of Americans believe the US is losing the war in Iraq, a proportion which analysts says could translate into a drubbing at the polls for Mr Bush's Republican Party in next month's mid-term elections.
The BBC's James Westhead in Washington says that while there is no official change in US strategy, change is on everyone's lips.
But a report in the New York Times that officials are drawing up a timetable for Iraq's government to improve security has been denied by both White House and state department officials.
In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Office Minister Kim Howells has suggested that the Iraqi security forces could take over much of the work of US-led forces within a year.
On Sunday funerals were taking place for 17 people killed in a mortar attack on a market near the capital, Baghdad.
Three men have been found guilty of plotting to kill thousands of people by blowing up planes from London to North America with home-made liquid bombs.
The massive police investigation caused chaos at airports as a ban on liquids was brought in overnight.
Chris Buckler reports on the huge disruption caused to passengers.
A witness saw the ginger cat being thrown from the front passenger seat of a black car at the Chiverton Cross roundabout near Blackwater.
A spokeswoman described it as a "brutal act to a friendly and loving animal".

In fact, in Finland it is only just beginning as the leading nations from across the globe gear up for the swamp football World Cup.
Unlike Sven-Goran Eriksson's men, this England team have failed to qualify for the event, while their Scottish rivals have been more successful.
The Scots will tackle the hosts Finland, Russia and Germany among others.
The sport itself follows exactly the same rules as football but is played on a muddy bog.
And Scottish captain Mark Middleton argues that the wet conditions in his country allow the perfect preparation for him and his team-mates.
Swamp football lends its origins to Finland, where it was invented by the Finnish army in the Nineties.
And Finland is fast becoming a country renowned for its eccentric sporting prowess.
The swamp football World Cup kicks off just a week after the Wife Carrying World Championship.
The sprint contest involved men covering a 235-metre course while carrying their wives on their backs or shoulders.
Obstacles on route to the top spot include log barriers and a water zone.
Couples in this year's competition ranged from South Koreans to Estonians.
Other more unusual Finnish pastimes include the much-loved sport of killing as many mosquitoes as possible in a designated time.
Another sees competitors sweat it out in a sauna to see who can last the longest in the hot conditions.
The second-rower was found guilty of the offence during Bath's 28-10 defeat at home following a European Rugby Cup disciplinary hearing in Dublin.
The stamp was deemed "mid-range in the level of seriousness".
The England international was banned for two weeks in November last year for striking Neil de Kock of Saracens.
Grewcock was red carded for the stamp in the 32nd minute as Bath crashed out of the Heineken Cup following the defeat.
The 37-year-old has a history of disciplinary problems which the independent judicial officer, Jean-Noel Couraud, took into consideration when delivering the punishment.
Grewcock is banned until 13 March 2010.
During his time as deputy to David Trimble, Mr Mallon never shirked from speaking out when he felt - as he often did - that the First Minister was being intransigent.
He showed the same trait when he quit the post after Mr Trimble refused to nominate ministers to the executive.
Through years of violence, despite living in the largely Protestant village of Markethill, Mr Mallon was a stern critic of the security forces, a frankness that led to death threats and attacks on the family home.
As MP for an area that has been suffered more than most during thirty years of conflict, he did not hesitate to speak out against the IRA.
But the benefits of a career devoted largely to politics have not always been obvious, and it was many years before Mr Mallon entered Westminster, becoming MP for Newry and Armagh, at the fourth attempt, in 1986.
As deputy leader of the SDLP since 1979, he has had a sometimes difficult relationship with John Hume, acknowledging once "we are very different people".
Mr Hume's tendency to act as a one-man band, has on occasion left Mr Mallon uncomfortably out of the loop.
A blunt, sometimes abrasive, often humorous man, Mr Mallon has earned the respect of many unionists as an honest spokesman for the nationalist cause.
The Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis said while he disagreed fundamentally with many of Mr Mallon's views, "he's truthful and principled and straight as a die".
A long-standing involvement in politics stretches back to the campaign for civil rights in the 1960's.
His appointment to the Senate, or second chamber in the Irish Republic, in 1982 led to his expulsion by an election court from the local Assembly which existed at that time.
Since becoming deputy first minister, Mr Mallon has won much admiration for his emphasis on the need for accommodation by both communities.
No politician in Northern Ireland is universally admired and Seamus Mallon certainly has his critics, both republican and unionist.
But for a politician who has been so long at the forefront of politics in such a divided community, his reputation is remarkably unscathed.
The argument against the publishing of "death rates" has always been that they are too simplistic and misleading.
But how can, say the opponents, you compare a heart surgeon who deals with only a few very sick cases, with one who does hundreds of operations a year - but whose patients are in the main healthy?
Or indeed a hospital in a leafy surburb with one in an area of deprivation and poverty?
But supporters of this type of information say the public have a right to know what the rest of the medical profession only talks about behind closed doors.
They were an attempt to measure the quality of the service and to show people how well the NHS was performing.
However, they fell into disrepute because of the extra administrative work they created for staff, and the fact that they measured the process of care, not the quality of it.
Today's clinical indicators are meant to address that.
However, despite earlier protestations about giving the public clearer and more relevant information about their local health services, these tables will be largely incomprehensible to the public.
They have been designed so as to make it virtually impossible to create a meaningful league table where the best and worst hospital in England can be ranked.
That's because the politicians recognise that the doctors might not co-operate if they feel they're being blamed for bad performance - fairly or otherwise.
There is also the fear that patients might decide to shop around.
If a local hospital is branded as being the worse in the country - or even the worse in the district - many people might reasonably decide that they'd prefer to have their treatment else where.
That, of course, would place an enormous strain on those other hospitals that would find their waiting lists rocketing.
Meanwhile the hospital being boycotted could find itself in a vicious circle.
Fewer patients and a poor reputation would make it hard to recruit staff, which in turn could lead to the royal medical colleges expressing concern about standards.
If nothing was done to turn the situation around the hospital could eventually be forced to merge with another unit or even close and services would be lost.
Geoff Taylor is still in a wheelchair with serious leg injuries afterthe elephant attacked his family during a tourist show on the Thai resort of Pattaya.
More than 200 family and friends gathered for the student nurse's funeral on Friday, in her home town of Billinge, near St Helens onMerseyside.
Mr Taylor, 53, and his daughter are still receiving medical treatment after the incident on 24 April.
The family were at the private-run Suan Nong Nuch park in Pattaya, south-east of Bangkok, when the enraged elephant charged at the crowd.
Mourners included Andrea Taylor's fellow students from Huddersfield University.
Aletter sent to the family from the university's vice chancellor, Professor John Tarrant, was readto the packed congregation.
It described Ms Taylor as an immensely popular student, whose death had "created an unfillable void in the lives of many of herfriends and colleagues and a deep loss for the future".
The Reverend Dennis Lyon, vicar of St Aidan Church, described Ms Taylor as "full of vitality with a sense of fun".
Dozens of floral tributes were laid in the student nurse's hearse, including one with her namewritten in red and white carnations.
The congregation sang Morning Has Broken before Andrea Taylor's friend Danny Sinclairread a tribute.
Ms Taylor was being cremated at a private service later in the day.
An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned on Wednesday at St Helenscoroner's court.
Nationalists appear to have turned out in greater numbers than unionists and observers believe Sinn Fein's Bairbre De Brun will top the poll comfortably.
"When the count begins properly on Monday there will be great interest in who will fill the two remaining seats," said BBC NI Political Editor Mark Devenport.
"The three unionist candidates appear to be tightly packed, which means the Traditional Unionist Jim Allister must have taken a significant percentage of the DUP vote.
"With the SDLP maintaining their vote has held up, the pattern of transferred votes between the parties could prove crucial.
The Scottish Government says its budget will bring economic stability, support thousands of jobs and get the economy moving again.
Yet, some of the key powers being used to tackle the problem rest not at Holyrood, but in Westminster.
Labour in Scotland says Gordon Brown's action to save the UK's historic financial institutions - including Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland - and his drive to claw back some of the �693,000 pension of former RBS boss Sir Fred Goodwin, are among the policies which are making the real difference.
But it could have been very different.
The SNP's victory in the Glasgow East Westminster by-election, an event which saw Labour lose one of its safest seats, prompted questions about Mr Brown's political future - a future thrown even more under the spotlight by a seemingly resurgent Conservative Party.
Then came another UK parliament by-election - Glenrothes.
But Labour pulled through to win with a decent majority, seeing off a strong SNP challenge.
The result came down to more than one factor, but some argued that it showed Mr Brown was the man to steer Britain through tough economic times.
While the Scottish Government does what it can while arguing things would be better under independence, Labour argues that effective action is being taken now by the UK Government.
At Holyrood, Iain Gray's first task as the newly appointed leader was steadying the Scottish Labour party ship, following Wendy Alexander's tenure.
She quit after continued questions over donations to her leadership campaign.
Mr Gray and his band of MSPs were instrumental in the unprecedented defeat of the Scottish Government budget, using the argument it would not help Scotland through the economic downturn.
Labour stuck to its guns and, a week later, the �30bn spending plans were passed after ministers agreed to the party's demands on boosting apprenticeships.
Scottish Labour still faces several challenges though - one of the most pressing being what to do about council tax.
Holyrood ministers have shelved their plans to replace council tax with a local income tax, partly because of a lack of parliamentary support.
Labour said this was a common-sense decision but, amid a growing consensus the tax needs to be reformed, the party must decide what to do about it.
The Scottish Government has also been battering away at Labour for inflicting a claimed �500m-a-year cut on the Scottish budget, as part of the Treasury's �5bn efficiency savings drive.
Again, Labour says a tightening of the belt is for the greater good.

Youhana made 106 off 126 balls, including a six and seven fours, before he was dismissed in the final over of his side's innings.
Set a target of 244, Bangladesh were in with a chance at 87-1 and 128-3 but collapsed following the dismissal of Rajin Saleh for 69.
Their last seven wickets went down for only 41 runs as Junaid Zia, the son of the Pakistan Cricket Board president, and Shoaib Malik made short work of the tail.
Having won the opening game by 137 runs, in which they totalled 323-3, Pakistan were unchanged and skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq adopted the same strategy of batting first when he won the toss.
Mohammed Hafeez (26) and Yasir Hameed (15) gave them a solid start before both fell to Mushfiqur Rahman.
Inzamam (41) helped Youhana add 87 for the third wicket before spinner Mohammad Rafique found a way through his defence and the rest of Pakistan's middle order fell cheaply as Saleh picked up 3-48 - his first wickets in one-day internationals.
But the tourists were unable to remove Youhana until four balls before the end of the innings, when he was caught in the outfield off pace bowler Mashrafe bin Mortaza.
Bangladesh lost a wicket in the opening over of their reply as Mohammad Ashraful was caught off Umar Gul for three.
Habibul Bashar and Saleh rebuilt the innings by adding 82 in 18 overs, but their progress was checked when Bashar (25) was lbw to Abdul Razzaq, who bowled Tushar Imran in his next over.
Saleh continued to bat impressively, collecting eight fours in his first one-day fifty, only to hole out at long-on in the 28th over as Malik made the crucial breakthrough.
Alok Kapali (37) was the only other batsman to reach double figures as Malik returned figures of 3-34, before Zia finished of the match with wickets in three successive overs to finish with 3-21.
Without a point in two races so far, the reigning constructors' champions have made their worst start since 1992.
Team boss Stefano Domenicali said Kers had given Ferrari a performance benefit - but they had encountered reliability problems with it in Malaysia.
"We are not happy and we must react immediately," he said on Thursday.
Ferrari are the first team to drop Kers (Kinetic Energy Recovery System), having used it on both Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen's cars in Australia and Malaysia, although they may go back to using it in the future.
"We found a problem with the Kers on Kimi's car in Sepang and we have therefore decided not to run with it in Shanghai," said Domenicali.
"We need to understand what happened to the system from the point of view of safety and reliability.
"It has delivered a performance benefit, but if it is not running safely and reliably, we can no longer take the risk of running it.
Kers technology stores energy from braking, which can then be used at driver discretion to provide a brief power boost for up to six seconds per lap.
The teams that have used Kers so far this season - Renault, Ferrari, McLaren, and BMW Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld - have had mixed success.
Though Kers provides added straight-line speed, the device does add extra weight to the car - causing tyre-wear and handling issues for some drivers.
Despite being taller and heavier, BMW's Robert Kubica has decided he will join team-mate Heidfeld in using the technology in China, having opted out in the opening two races.
Kers is a new innovation for this season as part of a series of changes designed to make overtaking easier and, subsequently, Formula 1 racing more exciting.
The Shanghai circuit includes two lengthy straights which may give drivers employing Kers an advantage.
For the first time ever, scientists have calculated a reliable estimate of the number of species on earth.

JonBenet Ramsey's parents, Jon and Patsy, reported their daughter missing on Boxing Day 1996.
However, the six-year-old's body was discovered just hours later in the basement of the family home in Boulder.
Suspicions rapidly fell on her wealthy parents, who resisted police attempts to interview them for months after the killing.
The Ramseys have consistently declared their innocence.
Within months of their daughter's death, the parents and their 10-year-old son Burke returned to Atlanta, Georgia, where they had once lived and where JonBenet is buried.
A Colorado grand jury investigated the case for 13 months.
But it completed its work on 14 October without finding sufficient evidence to charge anyone.
Mexican truck drivers are angered that despite numerous rulings by the World Trade Organisation against the United States, American restrictions still deny the Mexicans from crossing the border to deliver the benefits of global trade direct to the vast North American market.
The agreement commits the two neighbours and Canada to eliminate tariff barriers completely over several years, and allows a virtually uninterrupted flow of goods and services across the border.
And it is now seen as a model for a broader Free Trade Agreement in the Americas which could open up trade from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
But opposition from US drivers has effectively blocked small operators like Juan Pablo from fulfilling the spirit of the agreement.
US unions like the Teamsters argue that Mexico has lower standards for its drivers and trucks, and that it would be dangerous to allow them to drive through the US.
The Mexicans insist that is just plain old US protectionism - that Uncle Sam cannot stomach genuine competition when it undercuts its own industries.
"You've got to realise that the US-Mexico relationship is a bit like the elephant and the flea," said Mexico City economist Jonathan Heath.
That unbalanced partnership has made Washington often seem like a big bully to Mexicans, throwing its disproportionate weight around to bend the rules in its favour.
But Heath insists Nafta has worked to Mexico's benefit.
It has encouraged unprecedented development along the border regions; unemployment is down, exports are up and the macro-economic figures look good.
That alone has made many of Mexico's neighbours look enviously on the deal, but it has its fierce critics.
Among them are the Zapatista rebels who launched their uprising on New Year's Day in 1994 - the day the Nafta agreement went into effect.
The Zapatistas argue that the focus on statistics ignores the fact that the agreement has fundamentally changed Mexican culture.
The guerrilla movement says it began its rebellion to fight for greater rights for the nation's indigenous people, who've been marginalised by an increasingly globalised economy.
The rebel commander Subcommandante Marcos accused the Mexican government of being "money obsessed" and of wanting to turn the jungles of Chiapas into a homogenous world of strip malls and plastic play parks.
"In a country run by economists with only figures in their eyes, how can indigenous cultures survive without a money value?" asked one Zapatista supporter.
Other critics say NAFTA might have helped reduce unemployment, but its forced millions of poor Mexicans to work in US-owned sweatshops.
The Americans, they say, have simply exported exploitation.
"Part of the process of opening up your economy is coming to terms with these problems," say Jonathan Heath.
"But I think that on balance, we've done pretty well out of the United States," he said.
Its makers Warner Bros are no doubt hopeful that their latest sword and sandal epic will bring home the Oscars as Gladiator did in 2001.

Even computer users recognise a "Trojan horse" as something dangerous, if not to life and limb, at least to their PC, referring as it does to the crafty subterfuge which enabled the penetration of Troy.
The story appears to have everything - a 10-year conflict between mighty nations and their warrior heroes, triggered by the abduction of Helen of Troy - the most beautiful woman in the world.
But Professor Brian Rose, an archaeologist from the University of Cincinnati, has been trying to separate fact from this fiction for decades.
For centuries experts have pored over Homer's description of this lofty, heavily fortified city and attempted to put it on the modern map.
A recent study by University of Delaware geologists of sediments in the flood plain beside the city, suggests many of the battlefield details of Homer's Iliad may have been close to the truth as well.
Many archaeologists now believe that there was indeed a war, or perhaps several wars between Greeks and "Trojans" - most likely the western end of the huge Hittite empire which then dominated what is now Turkey.
What they really needed to prove that this indeed was Troy was some written evidence from the time that might suggest a conflict, and virtually none has ever been found.
However, when fragments of Hittite writings from this era were unearthed, they offered some tantalising clues.
They spoke of a dispute in the West at this time, and described a city whose name was similar to Ilion - a later name given to Troy.
No document from the period has ever mentioned a Helen of Troy, or an Achilles, but these writings mention an individual called Alexandros - an alternative version of the name Paris.
While Paris may have been a real person, it remains doubtful that his city descended into war over his desire for Helen - the strategic position of Troy on the main trade routes between East and West is a far more likely explanation.
Homer's epic was the blockbuster of its time, and it is possible that in a different age - eyesight permitting - he might have been a cinema scriptwriter himself, hyping up the battles and bringing in the love interest.
Audiences experiencing his stories for the first time this summer may be seeing a little more truth than in the average Hollywood potboiler.
They admitted piracy charges after copying and passing a DVD copy of the movie among them last May.
The six US men and one woman also pleaded guilty to criminal conduct in allowing an eighth person to obtain the film and upload it onto the internet.
They each face a maximum penalty of a $100,000 (�56,000) fine and one year in jail when sentenced on 12 April.
Prosecutors said 28-year-old Albert Valente took a copy of George Lucas's final Star Wars movie from a post-production facility in Los Angeles last May.
Mr Dimaano then passed a copy to work colleague Marc Hoaglin, 28, from Huntington Beach, who last month admitted putting a copy on the internet.
"We are glad to see the Star Wars thieves brought to justice," the Motion Picture Association of America said in a statement.
Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt said that after the first round of recruitment, the system would only fulfill a monitoring role this year.
Instead, the subsequent recruitment rounds will be CV-based, and handled at a local level by medical deaneries.
Doctors had complained the system was profoundly flawed, and that many juniors had been unfairly treated.
Juniors had to apply for a job through a system known as the medical training application service (MTAS).
But the system ran into serious trouble with many complaining about a lack of posts, poorly designed recruitment forms and technical failures with the online application system.
The doctors were angry about the way everyone was made to apply for training places at the same time, rather than the old rolling recruitment process which allowed them to keep on trying for jobs as they came up.
They feared those who missed out in the first round of recruitment would not be able to get back on the career ladder towards becoming a consultant.
It also emerged that the MTAS website had been the subject of two security breaches.
Ms Hewitt told the Commons earlier this month she was confident that criminal offences had not been committed.
But following further investigations a report has been sent to the police.
A campaign group of doctors, Remedy UK, has launched a legal challenge with the aim of getting the whole recruitment process scrapped.
However, ministers are committed to seeing through the first round of the recruitment process.
They said every eligible applicant in the first round had now been guaranteed at least one interview for their first preference post, and as a result an additional 15,500 interviews had been arranged, and were now taking place.
Only doctors who fail in the first round of recruitment will go to second and subsequent rounds.
The British Medical Association welcomed the decision to suspend the use of MTAS.
"Junior doctors have suffered blow after blow because of the government's terrible handling of these reforms.
However, Dr Rowland said the BMA remained opposed to the Remedy UK legal challenge, saying that scrapping the first round of applications would be disastrous for doctors, for patients, and for the NHS.
Dr Matt Jameson Evans, a spokesman for Remedy UK, was unimpressed by the government move, which he called a "grandiose smokescreen statement" intended to divert attention away from the fact that thousands of doctors had suffered at the hands of MTAS.
A review of MTAS will decide whether the system should be reinstated in future years.
The Netanyahu government in Israel has approved the building of 455 new homes for settlers in the West Bank - in defiance of Mr Obama's call for a complete settlement freeze.
One former US diplomat with extensive experience of the Middle East calls it "a huge slap in the face" for the Obama administration.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to have it both ways.
He wants to appease the settler lobby by allowing new construction, and to appease the Americans by finalising an agreement on a temporary freeze.
But he is in danger of satisfying no-one.
The White House has been quick to condemn the new announcement.
A Palestinian spokesman, Saeb Erakat, said the Israeli decision "nullifies any effect that a settlement freeze, when and if announced, will have".
Even the settlers and their supporters are unimpressed.
One Israeli analyst - quoted by the French news agency AFP - called the announcement "a sedative given to the settler lobby before proceeding with the painful operation of freezing settlements".
On the Middle East, as on other issues, Barack Obama entered the White House full of good intentions.
But like other presidents before him, he has discovered how resistant the region's problems are to solution.
Mr Obama, and his tireless Middle East special envoy George Mitchell, are still struggling to achieve some sort of breakthrough before 23 September.
That's when the president is expected to address the new session of the UN General Assembly.
He would like to use the occasion for a three-way meeting in New York with Mr Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
This would set the seal on the re-launch of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
But, with little more than two weeks to go, the pieces of the puzzle are stubbornly refusing to fall into place.
Mr Mitchell is due to return to Israel in a few days, for one more shot at finalising a settlement freeze.
Would that entice the Arabs into the game?
Mr Abbas says that without a meaningful freeze he won't resume talks.
The Arab states would be reluctant to take even modest steps towards normalising relations with Israel, as the Americans are urging them to.
Failure in the Middle East would damage Mr Obama's credibility.
As he grapples with the domestically difficult issue of healthcare and with an unpopular war in Afghanistan, many would conclude that he had bitten off more than he can chew.
The MoD said the soldiers, from 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, were killed at around 1830 local time (1500 BST) on Thursday.
It is understood they died when the planes dropped a bomb near their patrol in Helmand province.
The fighter planes had been called in to give air support to ground troops, the Ministry of Defence said.
Defence Secretary Des Browne said he was "very saddened" by the death of "three brave men who were tragically killed in what is believed to be a friendly fire incident".
He said such incidents were "rare" and it would be thoroughly investigated.
"We will look at this incident very carefully and make sure the families, who are uppermost in our thoughts, know exactly what happened to their loved ones," he said.
He added that US air support was very important and had often helped get British troops out of dangerous situations.
The MoD said all the soldiers had been taking part in a fighting patrol to disrupt Taleban activity to the north west of Kajaki, in Helmand province.
They came under attack from Taleban insurgents and during the firefight that followed, close air support was called in from two US F15 aircraft, according to the MoD.
Lt Col Mayo said one of the two was very seriously wounded and the other seriously wounded.
BBC Kabul correspondent Alastair Leithead said close air support was relied on by ground troops to provide cover, attack the enemy and to get them out of trouble.
"In the heat of battle when support is needed very quickly, nine times out of 10 it really does help to get troops out of very difficult positions," he said.
Wing Commander Andrew Brookes, a defence analyst, said such air cover must be relied on unless more troops were deployed on the ground.
The only other case of British service personnel being killed by in friendly fire involving American military personnel in Afghanistan in still under investigation.
An inquiry was launched in December 2006 into the death of marine Jonathan Wigley, 21, killed during an intense battle in Helmand province.
In February, Mr Browne told MPs that since 1990, 12 UK service personnel had been killed in friendly fire incidents involving American military personnel in Iraq.
The Royal Anglians, which have been based at Pirbright in Surrey for about five years, have been one of the regiments hardest hit by the fighting in Afghanistan.
On 11 August the regiment's Captain David Hicks was killed during an attack by the Taleban on his patrol base northeast of Sangin in Helmand province.
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT, said he was actually complimenting them for raising standards when he used the phrase.
He told the BBC he was arguing that greater responsibilities for classroom assistants meant they must be suitably qualified and trained and "could not be, as I used the phrase, 'pig ignorant peasants'".
A row had broken out over reports of Mr de Gruchy's comments and Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said he was "appalled" by the "outrageous" phrase.
But Mr de Gruchy said his intended meaning had been misinterpreted.
He used the phrase when speaking at a Social Market Foundation debate, shortly before Education Secretary Estelle Morris was due to make an address about classroom assistants.
Mr de Gruchy claimed he had not meant to cause any harm or offence and was "more than happy to offer my apologies to any classroom assistant" offended by the remarks.
The NASUWT, he said, was one of few unions happy to look at extending the role of people like classroom assistants to take the pressure off teachers.
The government is concerned about a shortage of teachers, expected to reach 40,000 posts in five years, and is keen to see schools staffed by adults with a "range" of skills.
"Classroom assistants have a wealth of experience and play a vital role in educating our children," he said.
At a wedding, war was declared on sheep.
Men gathering for the celebration - the majority of them members of the Ross family of Strathrusdale - decided to pursue an ambitious plan to drive thousands of the animals from the hills of Easter Ross and Sutherland.
Four days later, 400 men began the operation.
It would lead to the mobilisation of soldiers from Fort George, near Inverness, court trials, and, for one of those involved, an order banishing him from Scotland for life.
It was 1792 and the Highland Clearances were under way.
Landowners were evicting thousands of tenant crofting families - in some cases forcibly - to make way for lucrative large-scale livestock farming.
In one corner of the Highlands this led to the Ross-shire Sheep Riots as crofters stood against the new farmers.
The troubles of July and August 1792 saw the year become known in Gaelic as Bliadhna nan Caorach - the Year of the Sheep.
Faded and fragile papers from Inverness County Sheriff Court Records, held in Highland Council's archive and available online on the website Am Baile, give an insight into some of the events of that summer.
The sheep riots began in June when a shepherd, Allan Cameron, and three others - one of them a woman - were attacked by a mob of 80 to 100 people.
Cameron, who was from Lochaber, was accused by locals of impounding their free roaming horses and cattle and then demanding payment for their release, according to Am Baile's reading of the papers.
Prof Jim Hunter, director of the UHI Centre for History, said the events in the Highlands played out against the backdrop of the French Revolution, which had started in 1789.
The historian does not believe the rioters were inspired by the revolution, though they may well have been aware of its effect instilling fear and suspicion among the government and monarchy that a similar uprising would happen in Britain.
He said what happened in Ross-shire in 1792 was a reaction to people being forced off the land.
"It was a well-organised attempt to do something.
Scots - including many Highlanders - had fought in the Seven Years' War of 1756-63 and American Revolution of 1775-83.
The first pitted Britain and its allies against France and its supporters in what has been described as the "first world war", while the later conflict saw George Washington lead the colonist Continental Army to victory against British rule.
The sheep drivers recruited to their ranks as they pushed south.
By early August, they had rounded up 6,000 sheep and had reached Beauly, near Inverness.
Soldiers of the 42nd Regiment, better known as the Black Watch, were sent from Fort George on the Moray Coast to arrest the sheep drivers.
The Inverness County Sheriff Court Records reveal the punishments ordered for six men accused of driving sheep away.
They were Hugh Breck MacKenzie, John Aird, Malcolm Ross, Donald Munro, Alexander MacKay and William Cunningham.
MacKenzie and Aird were both ordered to be transported for seven years "beyond seas to such places as His Majesty shall appoint".
If they returned to Britain in those seven years they were to be sentenced to death.
Ross was to be fined £50 and detained in prison for a month and Cunningham three years in prison.
MacKay and Munro were to be banished from Scotland for the rest of their lives.
Today, the sheep industry that grew in part from the clearances is facing problems of its own.
However, NFU Scotland warn increased production costs and more regulation from Europe is driving many farmers out of the business.
Jonathan Walters scored the only goal in the first leg of Stoke's Europa League third-round qualifying tie against Hajduk Spilt.
The Republic of Ireland international nodded in from Matthew Etherington's cross after three minutes as the Potters made an impressive start.
Kenwyne Jones had a goal disallowed before Dean Whitehead and Robert Huth came close, but a dominant Stoke could not extend their lead.
The second leg takes place on 4 August.
Hajduk's visit was only Stoke's third home European game and the result far from guarantees Tony Pulis's side's progress to the play-off round.
After Walters' opener, Jones appeared to have added to the advantage a couple of minutes later, only to have the referee rule he had infringed in outmuscling the Hadjuk defence at the back post.
Centre-back Huth's decision to lurk in the penalty area after coming forward for a set-piece almost paid off, but his well-struck shot was deflected over the bar.
The German then headed wide from Etherington's corner after the break and Hadjuk goalkeeper Danijel Subasic had to be alert to palm away a cross from the on-rushing Walters as the hosts continued to press.
Former Tottenham defender Jonathan Woodgate remained on the bench as Pulis instead brought on centre-half Ryan Shotton as the hosts' frustrations increased in the closing stages.
And Stoke were forced to settle for a slender lead once Whitehead's drilled effort was well blocked in their last clear opening of the match.

Pensioners who moved to countries such as Australia and Canada only receive the level of pension paid at retirement - which might be only £6 per week.
The European Court of Human Rights rejected an appeal from a group of pensioners who wanted to receive increases in line with inflation.
Expats have been getting in touch with the BBC about what they think of the ruling.
I have been very angry about this situation for many years.
I came to Australia at the age of 41 and starting collecting my pension at the age of 62.
We don't have a lot of savings, and what we do have is being rapidly used up.
I am a teacher in Japan and I have been living here with my wife and children for nine years.
I'm not entitled to claim for benefits such as unemployment benefit, but I am entitled to the state pension, and I think it is wrong that it will not be index-linked.
For me, the weakest part of the British position is that they can't claim they pay no one abroad - they pay many expats an indexed pension, but only if they live in a few select countries.
It makes you feel like they just ignore you and forget you - you're just a nice little budget reduction.
Michael Blakemore's production includes four American stars of the stage, Marin Mazzie, Brent Barrett, Michael Barrasse and Nancy Anderson.
It is hoped that the light-hearted musical will revive the West End's fortunes after theatre-going tourists have stayed away from London since the terror attacks of 11 September.
"Kiss Me Kate is a musical for real musical lovers, big numbers intermingling with several ballad fillers," says BBC News Online's Keily Oakes.
The controversial star hugged his fellow contestants before leaving the camp at 0230 GMT on Thursday.
Meanwhile, ex-footballer Neil "Razor" Ruddock became the third celebrity to be voted off the show on Wednesday.
Producers have decided not to have the fourth eviction on Thursday's programme because two celebrities left the previous day.
"We respect his decision to quit and hope we haven't seen the last of him," she said.
Lydon's expletive outburst earlier this week came after he realised he was not going to be evicted.
ITV and media regulator Ofcom received 91 complaints and the former Sex Pistols singer was warned not to repeat the outburst.
The broadcaster has now put into place a time delay of a few seconds so it can make sure no more surprise swear words go out on air.
But Lydon's tirade has boosted sales of the Sex Pistols' classic album Never Mind the Bollocks at Virgin Megastores - sales are up 169% compared to last week.
Neil Ruddock was one of the favourites to win when the show began last week and his fellow contestants were shocked to see him go.
He told presenters Declan Donnelly and Ant McPartlin the worst thing about being in the camp was the hunger.
"I could not eat the food - I thought I was going to die," he said after his eviction.
There are six other contestants left in the show - Alex Best, Kerry McFadden, Jennie Bond, Peter Andre, Jordan and Lord Brocket.
Lord Brocket has been installed as the new favourite by bookmakers, followed by former Atomic Kitten star McFadden.
A child and two other people were injured when three men opened fire on the office, which covers the south-east of Iran, state media say.
On Thursday, at least 19 people died in a bomb blast in a Shia mosque in the city, which is predominantly Sunni.
A Sunni militant group has reportedly said it was behind the attack.
Abdel Raouf Rigi, described as a spokesman for the Jundallah group, told Saudi-owned TV channel Al-Arabiya that a suicide bomber had targeted a secret meeting of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards inside the Amir al-Mohini mosque.
Officials have accused the US of being behind the bombing but a US state department spokesman on Friday denied any Washington involvement.
The gunmen attacked Mr Ahmadinejad's campaign HQ at about 1900 local time (1430 GMT) on Friday, the state news agency Irna reports.
"Three knife-wielding people on motorbikes stopped outside the centre on Saadi Street, cursed, made threats and tore up billboards," Mohammad Reza Zahed Sheikhi, who heads Mr Ahmadinejad's election office in Zahedan, told the news agency.
When campaign workers tried to protest, he added, "the attackers pulled out guns and shot at them".
Police reportedly arrested the assailants as they tried to escape.
Zahedan is the capital of a remote province which is one of the most deprived in the predominantly Shia country.
Militants operate in the area, many of them with links to the drugs gangs, and clashes with the security forces are common.
Three people were arrested following the attack on the mosque, according to Jalal Sayah, deputy governor of Sistan-Baluchestan province.

Japan launches its new space freighter
Its role is vitally important to the station project, which is set to lose the servicing capability of the US shuttle fleet next year.
The freighter left Earth atop an H-IIB rocket at 0201 local time on Friday (1701 GMT, Thursday).
Separation from the rocket's upper-stage was confirmed some 15 minutes later.
The HTV mission is being directed by engineers in Tsukuba, Japan, and at the US space agency's (Nasa) mission control in Houston.
The vehicle must conduct a number of tests of its navigation and rendezvous systems before making a close approach to the International Space Station (ISS).
Docking is not expected to take place until at least day eight of the mission.
Over the next few years, the HTV, and the other robotic re-supply ships like it, will be central to the operation of a fully crewed, fully functional ISS.
"This HTV-1 vehicle is a demonstration flight to verify its functionality and performance," said Masazumi Miyake, one of the Japanese space agency's (Jaxa) senior officials in the US.
The flight to orbit marked the first time Jaxa had used the H-IIB rocket, a beefed up version of the existing H-11A launcher.
The rocket incorporates additional solid-fuel boosters and a second main engine on its core stage to achieve significant extra thrust.
Unlike all previous spacecraft to visit the International Space Station (ISS), the HTV will not drive all the way into the orbiting platform.
Instead, the Japanese ship will simply park itself under the bow of the ISS to allow the station's robotic arm to grab it.
The vessel will then be locked into an Earth-facing docking port on the Harmony (Node 2) connecting module.
The HTV will remain attached to the ISS for about six weeks while its supplies are unloaded.
These exterior supplies include two new Earth-observation experiments for the exposed "terrace" of instruments that sits outside Japan's Kibo science module.
Again, astronauts will use the station arm to remove the pallet before handing it across to the Kibo arm, which will then position the new experiments.
• After the first HTV mission, Japan plans a further six flights through to 2015.
HTV and Dragon are particularly important because of their ability to deliver larger items in their unpressurised compartments that would not normally fit through the docking port of a pressurised compartment.
Backstage lets people remix the BBC's content to make new applications.
The latest content release is seven-day listings information for TV and radio, in a format called TV Anytime.
The backstage project, which is part-sponsoring the Open Tech conference, opened its doors to developers in May, but officially launches at Open Tech on Saturday.
Users "tag" their bookmarks with keywords which makes them easier to find and share.
Mr Metcalfe added that developers might want to play around with the TV schedule data, mixing it with other social elements, such as recommendation systems for friends or alert systems, for instance.
Or the schedules could be combined with other web data to create genre-based programme searches or listings.
There are a number which the BBC is interested in looking at further, said Mr Metcalfe.
He said the themes of the Open Tech conference (formerly NotCon) fit well with what BBC was trying to achieve in its bid to be more open and inclusive.
The conference will include talks from Yahoo's Jeremy Zawodny and discussion panel sessions with well known net commentators, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Cory Doctorow, who also contributes to the award-winning blog, Boing Boing.
Big companies, such as Google and Yahoo, have also recognised the value of being more open by releasing content tool kits for developers to create applications with.
"Companies are waking up and realising that they need to have a conversation with their audience," explained Mr Metcalfe.
The project is part of the BBC's commitment in response to last year's Graf Report, which appraised what the BBC does online, to support social innovation and help user efforts.
The BBC also recently launched a dedicated open source website, aimed at providing information about and links to BBC open source projects.
Delegates came from around the world and in the opening day, in one Q&A session, within the space of 10 minutes there were voices from Africa, Russia, France, Costa Rica, Japan and China.
The forum is designed as a space for debate and this year access for all was high on the agenda.
IGF's executive co-ordinator Markus Kummer said that "access was still the single most important issue to all".
However, there were several pressing social issues all on the agenda, which reflect the growth, un-chartered and sometimes hazardous nature of the internet, such as child protection, security and human rights.
The opening introductory session was chaired by Brazilian Minister of Culture and musician Gilberto Gil who was joined by UN Under Secretary Sha Zukang.
Mr Zukang delivered a statement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon who praised the event
According to the UN Secretary General's statement there are an estimated one billion internet users but some five billion still do not have access "to this empowering tool".
Brazil is one country that is making good progress in terms of connecting citizens to the internet and has 39 million users.
Helio Costa, minister of communications in the country, stressed the need for local focus.
He said Brazil had enjoyed success through financing a low cost computers scheme in 2005.
Rajesh Bansal, of Nokia Siemans in India, stressed that improving access meant "communicating more with local people".
He said that companies in the past had underestimated the intelligence and creativity of local communities, which had often come up with better and cheaper solutions for internet use.
Many at the form felt "access for all" should mean not just across country borders but also within different groups, including providing easy access for those with disabilities.
Accessibility is also influenced by language and by possible language constraints.
One African delegate said the forum had to "make a collective commitment to the next generation of internet users".
There were concerns from many at the forum that local languages would be side-stepped on the internet in favour of a more homogeneous culture.
UNESCO is currently working with the ITU (International Telecommunications Union) and Icann (Internal Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the overseers of the net, towards an agreement on universal standards on languages and a multi-lingual internet.
"ITU is fully committed to assist its membership in promoting the diversity of language scripts for domain names," said Dr Hamadoun Tour�, secretary general of ITU.
He went on to encourage "advancement across language barriers".
Icann is currently testing domain names which are using alphabets of a range of languages, including Arabic.
"Icann is in the midst of the largest ever evaluation of international domain names at the top level," said Dr Paul Twomey, head of the organisation.
Arsenal became the first team to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup as they recorded a comfortable win against Watford at Vicarage Road.
Gifton Noel-Williams struck back for the Hornets - but Kanu's second-half header and Dennis Bergkamp's tap-in sealed the victory before Watford scored a late consolation.
Watford have now exited the FA Cup at the third round stage 10 times in 12 years, including the last five seasons in succession.
Arsenal have been guilty of over-elaboration in front of goal this season.
And Robert Pires' shocking second-half miss typified their sometimes apparent lack of no-nonsense finishing.
With the goal gaping, the Frenchman took an unnecessary extra touch on the ball and the opportunity went begging.
By then Arsenal had virtually secured passage to the next round, after Kanu finally accepted a chance to score his first goal since November and put his side 3-1 up.
He nodded in from Henry's cross, but wasted a number of other chances and could have claimed a hat-trick.
Watford had briefly rallied earlier to give themselves a glimmer of hope when Noel-Williams scored with an excellent header to halve their deficit.
Henry had slotted home after rounding the keeper and Ljungberg netted 95 seconds later as the Gunners raced into a 2-0 lead.
In the closing moments of the match, Marcus Gayle made the scoreline look less convincing when he grabbed a second for Watford.
It earned a bit of respectability - but Watford have no complaints after being comprehensively outplayed and well-beaten.
Hiddink unhappy with 'sloppy' Chelsea
"If you play at the top you cannot afford to do it twice," said Chelsea's boss after his side leaked three goals in nine minutes in their 4-3 victory.
"I am not just talking about the defence but also the midfield and front players," added the Dutchman.
Chelsea face Liverpool in their second-leg Champions League quarter final tie on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge, having won the first leg 3-1 at Anfield.
With presumably one eye on that game, Hiddink withdrew goalscorers Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba with 20 minutes remaining, but the Chelsea manager insisted the substitutions had not prompted his side's mini-collapse.
Great Britain's Aaron Cook misses out on a bronze medal in the men's 80kg taekwondo following a 4-1 defeat by China's Zhu Guo.
Cameras capture the extent of the damage
About 15 unidentified men broke into the building before daubing graffiti on the walls and desecrating scriptures.
They also called for Jewish people to be expelled from the country.
Jewish leaders say tensions have risen since Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Israel this month over its recent military offensive in Gaza.
Elias Farache, president of Venezuela's Jewish Association, said the gang had tied and gagged security guards before destroying offices and the place where holy books were kept.
Anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli slogans were painted on the walls.
"Never in the history of Venezuela's Jewish community have we been the target of such an aggression," said Mr Farache.
Venezuela and Israel have had strained relations for some time, and Caracas has been fiercely critical of Israel's military operations in Gaza, which started in late December.
The Venezuelan ambassador and his staff were ordered to leave the country on 6 January, and President Hugo Chavez has urged Israelis to stand up against their government.
Israel responded by ordering Venezuelan diplomats to leave, declaring them "persona non grata in Israel" earlier this week.
But Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro condemned the "criminal act of vandalism" at the synagogue.
"We call all the Venezuelan people, the entire Venezuelan community, to reject these actions, with the same moral force with which we reject the crimes committed against the Palestinian people," he said.
Venezuelan Information Minister Jesse Chacon also condemned the attack and denied it had any connection with the government.
The two men, Boban Milenkovic and Sefko Tairovic, had been captured in Yugoslavia last month by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, and handed over to the US military in Albania.
The BBC's correspondent in Budapest, Nick Thorpe, says following the release of three American servicemen by the Yugoslav authorities at the beginning of May, the return of the two Serbs had been widely expected.
Under the Geneva Convention they could have been kept until the end of the armed conflict.
Twenty four F-18 attack aircraft were expected to arrive in Hungary next weekend and to participate in raids launched from Hungarian territory, for the first time in the conflict.
A court in Moscow ruled that Denis Kvasov and his site had operated within the bounds of Russian law.
The site was attracting millions of customers before it was shut in June - under pressure from US music firms.
The site has also been a thorny issue in US-Russia talks over Moscow's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
Mr Kvasov, head of Mediaservices, which owned the website, was put on trial after EMI, Warner Music Group and Universal music companies pressed for his prosecution.
But District Judge Yekaterina Sharapova on Wednesday threw out the prosecution's case.
"The prosecution did not succeed in presenting persuasive evidence of his involvement in infringing copyright law," she said.
During the trial, Mr Kvasov successfully argued that he had paid royalties to a local organisation, the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society (Roms).
The head of Russia's anti-piracy organisation, Konstantin Zemchenkov, said the court's verdict set a "very bad precedent".
The site offered downloads at far lower prices than mainstream businesses like iTunes.
Mediaservices has always maintained it pays royalties to Roms, but many Western firms do not recognise this organisation and refuse to accept its offers of payments.
As part of protracted negotiations over Russia's entry to the WTO, an agreement in principle was reached regarding website regulation in 2006.
The country is also a common destination for refugees and asylum seekers - immigrants make up more than 10% of its population.
The Alliance for Sweden, a centre-right coalition headed by Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt, came to power at elections in September 2006, ending 10 years of rule by the Social Democrat Party.
Governing with a slim seven-seat majority in its first term, Mr Reinfeldt's government cut income taxes, trimmed benefits and sold off state assets.
Buoyed by Sweden's rapid economic recovery from the 2008 , Mr Reinfeldt looked assured to win a second term ahead of elections in 2010 and become the first centre-right PM to be re-elected since World War II.
The opposition centre-left Social Democrats, who governed Sweden for much of the period since World War II, suffered a painful slump in support.
Swedish audiences enjoy a wide variety of public and commercial broadcast services.
The experiment at Cern, in Geneva, aims to produce antiatoms, and to slow them down long enough to conduct experiments on them.
It is hoped the results will explain why the world is made of matter rather than antimatter - which only occurs naturally in cosmic ray collisions.
Scientists have been puzzling for years over the disappearance of antimatter, as the Big Bang should have created the same amount of matter and antimatter, and in principle the two should have wiped each other out.
The experiment will be looking closely for any difference between antimatter and matter to explain the asymmtery.
Even a minute difference could explain why the world is made of matter, and why antimatter disappeared.
It slows antiprotons, the antimatter equivalent of the proton, down to what Cern describes as a "leisurely pace" - one tenth of the speed of light.
After trapping the antiprotons, the scientists mix them with positrons, the antimatter equivalent of the electron, to produce antihydrogen.
Cern succeeded in creating nine antihydrogen atoms in 1996, but they disappeared almost instantly.
Cern hopes to have the first antihydrogen atoms by the end of 2000, and to have analysed some of the results by the end of 2002.
Two other projects on antimatter, at Stanford in California, and at a Japanese national laboratory, presented initial results last week.
Those projects do not aim to build antiatoms, but to compare the decay of antiparticles with the decay of normal particles.
Nuclear energy is going to be for Gordon Brown what weapons of mass destructions were for Tony Blair, what we need is clean, safe renewables and nuclear power distracts from that.
And two unions have called for a maximum 35-hour working week to be extended to the rest of the UK.
Some schools have even been forced to move to a four-day week - and unions have warned that the Scottish pay deal could make matters worse.
John Bangs of the National Union of Teachers said some teachers living in the north of England could be tempted to cross the border by the �800m package approved by unions and local authorities on Friday.
"With 4000 vacancies being created in Scotland, there may well be choices made by teachers in England to go north of the border," he told the BBC.
There will also be 4000 new teachers, and additional support staff to help reduce the burden of paper work.
Classroom teachers will be able to earn up to �35,000 a year - �5000 more than they can earn in England without switching into management.
The NUT's general secretary Doug McAvoy said teaching in Scotland was now a very attractive career.
"It will attract teachers from England who don't have any of the advantagesin terms of the conditions of service that this deal offers," he predicted.
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association ofSchoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) - which has about 2,000 members inScotland - said the maximum 35-hour working week was the "mostinteresting" aspect of the deal.
He also warned that schools in England could now find it even harder to attract teachers.
The young teachers from Australia and New Zealand, to whom many schools turn to fill vacancies, would now be tempted to seek more money in Scotland.
"This sets an obvious example to (Education Secretary) David Blunkett and Ithink morale of teachers in England and Wales will be severely depressed if theydo not get at least equal treatment," he said.
However, the Department for Education and Employment at Westminster said suggestions that teachers in England and Wales would receive a three or four per cent pay rise were purely speculation.
"We arestill awaiting this year's pay award recommendations from the School TeachersReview Body," said a spokeswoman.
After winning the TV show, Georgia revealed that she'd love to cook up a meal for Justin Bieber, as she's such a massive fan!
She began cooking when she was six and plans to start up her own restaurant when she's older.
Georgia beat 11-year-olds Amber, George and 12-year-old Hajrah in the final of the series.
Two first-half goals helped Bafana Bafana to secure the victory in Group 4 of the 2010 World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in Pretoria.
Kagisho Dikgacoi put South Africa in the lead in the 10th minute before Surprise Moriri's strike on 34 minutes extended their advantage.
Thembinkosi Fanteni looked to have sealed an emphatic win with his goal on the hour mark but Juvenal pulled one back from the penalty with 14 minutes remaining.
Bafana Bafana then made sure of victory when Dikgacoi bagged his second of the game in injury time.
As hosts of the 2010 World Cup South Africa qualify for the tournament automatically but still need to go through qualifying to reach the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola in the same year.
Defender Joseph Yobo scored with only one minute remaining to snatch the victory in Freetown.
Yobo applied the finishing touch in a goalmouth melee to hand the Super Eagles the win.
Nigeria, who twice saw their hosts hit the woodwork, beat South Africa 2-0 last Sunday in their opening qualifier.

The 43-year-old who succeeded Stan Ternent in the summer of 2004, leaves the club 15th in the table after a run of just one win in their last 10 games.
BBC Radio Lancashire understands that assistant boss Steve Davis is in charge for Saturday's trip to Leicester.
Chairman Barry Kilby is holding a press conference at Turf Moor on Friday, 9 November at 1600GMT.
Liam Coyle's stunning second half strike secured a third Carlsberg FAI Cup success for Derry City.
The northerners had been second best during the opening half but Coyle's goal two minutes after the break turned the match on its head.
David Kelly, playing his final competitive match before taking on a backroom role at Tranmere Rovers, should have added to Derry's lead two minutes later.
The miss could have proved crucial as Rovers had several opportunities to level including a couple of injury time chances which somehow the Derry defence cleared to safety.
But while Derry skipper Eamon Doherty deservedly earned the man-of-the-match award, there was no doubting that veteran Coyle had been the hero.
"I can't remember much about the goal," said Coyle afterwards.
"There was a corner and Ciaran Martyn mishit it.
Apart from Coyle's tremendous goal, the final will also be remembered for a bizarre first half interruption caused by a fire which started near where many of the Shamrock Rovers fans were positioned.
The use of fire extinguishers in the windy conditions meant smoke billowed towards some supporters and a number of fans spilled out on to the pitch.
The game was held up for eight minutes but fortunately, there didn't appear to be any injuries.
Prior to the unscheduled break, the action had been dull with Tony Grant's weak eighth minute effort the only decent chance in the opening quarter.
Rovers picked up the pace in the second quarter and Derry goalkeeper Alan Gough had to make great saves to deny Terry Palmer and Luke Dimech.
However, Derry had chances of their own with Paddy McLaughlin having a chance blocked and Sean Friars seeing a header well-saved by Tony O'Dowd.
Coyle's 47th minute goal came when he somehow turned to lash Martyn's mishit effort past the Rovers goalkeeper.
Kelly's missed chance two minutes later was a much easier opportunity but the former Republic of Ireland international pulled the chance across the face of goal.
Coyle was called ashore 11 minutes after his goal with Tommy McCallion introduced to the Derry line-up.
The last half hour saw Derry living dangerously on several occasions.
Former Derry man James Keddy probably missed the best Rovers chance on 64 minutes when he nodded inches wide from pointblank range with the City defence nowhere to be seen.
Referee Jim O'Neill decided that five minutes of injury-time were needed at the death and Rovers looked certain to profit on two occasions during overtime.
However, Derry somehow held on to guarantee European football next season.
Sport Relief is finally bringing Celebrity Pigeon Racing to the prime time Saturday night audience it deserves.
Viewers will be perched on the edge of their seats on July 15th as a frenzy of feathered fun unfolds before them.
Chris Evans, Gary Lineker and Davina McCall have all taken an elite avian specimen under their wing.
The plucky pigeons will race from London's Television Centre to their home in East Acton - covering their very own Sport Relief Mile.
But the presenter whose bird trails in last will be subjected to a forfeit live in the Sport Relief studio.
We take an exclusive behind-the-scenes look to see how our presenters have been bonding with their birds.
She will be hoping the time spent on set will prevent Pam the pigeon suffering from stage fright on the big night.
McCall has also been imparting words of wisdom to her pigeon in the confines of her Big Brother dressing room.
She hopes her motivational diary room pep talks will inspire Pam to leave her rivals flapping.
We can't be sure what has been said behind closed doors but Davina will be anxious to avoid public humiliation on the night.
Chris Evans believes inner peace will be the key to victory for him and his winged warrior on July 15th.
He and Monty have been meditating on the golf course and listening to mystical Eastern music in an effort to reach a higher spiritual plain.
Chris may have enhanced his appreciation of the sitar whilst on a cricket tour with the Sport Relief Redsocks in India.
It's not clear if Monty or Chris is benefiting most from the chill out music.
But Chris seems confident that inner peace is the route to success when it comes to pigeon racing.
Monty has also been spending time in the radio Two studio listening to Chris' drive time show.
Sadly his requests for the Housemartins, the Byrds and Alice Cooper have largely been ignored.
The forlorn pigeon is reduced to catching fleeting glimpses of his illustrious mentor during the BBC's World Cup coverage.
Alan realises Gary's absence is for the good of the nation but sources close to the pigeon say he is a shadow of his former self.
However he has displayed his discipline and unselfish nature by following Gary's strictly imposed training regime to the letter.
Lineker is said to be livid that he can't devote more of himself to Alan's development but has been sending motivational postcards on a regular basis.
Old Mutual, South Africa's biggest insurance firm, said it would expand its medical aid programme to offer the drugs to the 600 members of its staff believed to be infected with HIV, the virus which causes Aids.
"What is the price of a human life when you can save people and their dependants?" chief executive Roddy Sparks said.
But he admitted the move would cost the firm "millions".
"At some stage there's more to (this than) costs," he added.
The move adds Old Mutual to the small but growing list of South African firms which have decided to provide anti-Aids drugs to staff, regardless of their rank.
Mining giant Anglo American, which estimated that almost one quarter of its 90,000-strong southern African workforce was HIV positive, last month revealed it was to make treatment available to all infected employees.
The South African government is testing the drug nevirapine in the hope of preventing mother-to-child transmission of the virus, but has refused to offer drugs to Aids sufferers.
Old Mutual said that, despite Tuesday's announcement, it would not be revising its bar on providing insurance for people living with HIV/Aids.
Banks and insurers have been criticised by Aids campaigners for unfairly blocking access by sufferers to financial services.
"We believe that insurance companies have contributed to the genocide of people who died prematurely of HIV/Aids related illnesses in South Africa," the National Association of People living with HIV/Aids (Napwa) said.
Old Mutual deputy chief executive Peter Moyo said the firm could not afford to underwrite such cover.
A Sotheby's spokesman said it was their highest pre-sale estimate.

Targeting viruses, bacteria and parasites responsible for triggering cancers could reduce the number of cases by as much as 20%, the World Summit Against Cancer was told.
Dr Harold zur Hausen, of the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, said tackling viruses was particularly important.
Liver cancer is strongly associated with Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) is present in up to 99% of cervical cancer cases.
Brain tumours and childhood leukaemia may also involve viruses.
Vaccines using particles of HPV virus were being tested in human clinical trials and looked "extremely promising", he said.
Other scientists are testing vaccines which could prevent the infection.
The conference in Paris also heard that lung cancer is now the leading cause of deaths from any cancer in the world and that this is mostly due to smoking.
Professor Virginia Ernster, of the University of California in San Francisco, who has campaigned against tobacco in the US, said lung cancer was now responsible for one-in-three cancer deaths in men in the US.
She warned of a potential "epidemic" of tobacco related diseases in the Western world.
At 15st 12lbs, Tyson is giving a lot of weight away to Savarese who weighed in at just over 17st.
Tyson looked in excellent physical condition for a man whose preparations for the fight are reported to have been less than ideal.
He posed for photographs alongside Scottish lightweight great Ken Buchanan and former world champion Mike McCallum, apparently in good spirits.
But Savarese believes he can cash in on Tyson's less-than-ideal build-up.
"I don't consider Mike Tyson a legend byany means," Savarese said.
Tyson's Muslim supporters were disappointed on Friday when the boxer failed to turn up at a Glasgow mosque.
The fighter, who converted to Islam while he was in jail serving a sentence for rape, had promised to visit the mosque, but fans who turned up were kept waiting.
Leeds United were only the second English side to reach a European Cup final following Manchester United's win of 1968.
Don Revie had built this great Leeds side but had left for the England job when they reached a European Cup final.
Their opponents were cup holders, but anticipated a tough time against the English champions.
"We knew that English sides were always tough to play," said German keeper Sepp Maier.
Captain Franz Beckanbauer admitted that Leeds were "one of the best sides in Europe".
They were also one of the most physical and Bayern were incensed at a fourth minute horror challenge by Terry Yorath on Bjorn Andersson, who had to be stretchered off.
Still Leeds had more to complain about, denied a clear penalty after Beckanbauer brought down Allan Clarke in the first half.
Then 25 minutes before the end, Peter Lorimer's fierce volley hit the back of the net.
"We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end we were the winners but we were very, very lucky," admitted Beckanbauer.
Paris then experienced pitched battles between the English visitors and police, and the whole affair resulted in a three-year European ban for Leeds.
"He was very suspicious," Bremner said of the French referee, although the late Leeds captain admitted the team had not played as well as it might have done.
The 62-year-old and an air cadet were killed after taking off from RAF Benson on Sunday.
Witnesses said they saw both aircraft nose-diving into fields at Sutton Courtenay, near Abingdon.
The civilian glider's pilot, Henry Freeborn, from Lee-on-the-Solent in Hampshire, parachuted to safety.
Local resident James O'Neill said he heard the noise of an aircraft come very low over the house, followed by a thud.
His wife then saw the two aircraft spiralling into the ground.
Penny Down, who lives next to the field, saw the trainer plane sweeping the top of the trees and crash down.
The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) returned to the scene on Monday.
Thames Valley Police said the German-made Standard Cirrus glider would be moved later on Monday and the single-engine Tutor RAF aircraft would probably be moved on Tuesday.
The families have been informed, but the cadet's name has yet to be released.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was too early to comment on the cause of the crash.
In February, two Air Training Corps cadets and their RAF instructors were killed in a mid-air crash between two light aircraft in south Wales.
He also faced calls from the opposition Conservative Party to apologise to British industry because of his support for Labour donor and steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal.
Mr Mittal's US operation was one of the companies pushing for tariffs to be slapped on imported steel.
Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused the prime minister of being more interested in backing his rich friends than standing up for British industry.
Mr Blair said he would take no lessons from a Conservative Party that while in Government "destroyed 100,000 British steel jobs".
Earlier, the official spokesman for Mr Blair, who wrote to and spoke on the telephone to US president George Bush last week, said the UK and EU believed the US action broke world trade rules.
Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt, who told the BBC she was "bitterly disappointed" with the tariffs, is to make a statement to MPs about the affair later on Wednesday.
US President George W Bush introduced the tariffs as part of a three-year plan to help the ailing US steel industry, which has been struggling to compete with cheaper products from abroad.
Confederation of British Industry director-general Digby Jones warned that US tariffs would put UK jobs insteel and other manufacturing firms at risk.
UK producer Corus, which sells about 5% of its products to the US, urged the European Union to mount protective counter-measures.
And it also blamed the US steel industry for creating the problems which led to the tariffs in the first place.
"US steel producers' problems are caused by a failure torestructure and consolidate, not by imports which actuallydeclined by 20% in 2001," the spokesman said.
Nick Clegg, East Midlands Euro MP for the Liberal Democrats, said the move was "shocking" and an "a form of economic vandalism".
Gordon Brown was no longer the potential prime minister, the betrayed friend or the dour iron chancellor with a penchant for prudence.
He was a grieving father and a caring husband, heartbroken at the death of his baby daughter Jennifer earlier this year.
For once in the chancellor's life, politics was very much at the back of his mind.
Mr Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy.
At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland.
He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD.
Mr Brown's early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.
His first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram.
Entering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair.
Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.
He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992.
And the death of Mr Smith in 1994 led to one of the longest-running sagas of Westminster life over an alleged agreement broken by Mr Blair.
But if Mr Brown's leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, he continued his devotion to politics.
During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.
This devotion to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was "politics, politics, politics".
Following Labour's election victory last year, the chancellor had a relatively quiet time and he and wife Sarah - the couple married in 2000 - prepared for parenthood.
His pre-Budget report received a cool reception, while in the wake of 11 September, he took a back seat as the prime minister strode the world stage.
Since he returned to work, Mr Brown has been concentrating on the Budget and this summer's spending review.
Ministers with expensive plans on their minds are being warned that the chancellor has lost none of his fondness for prudence.
The ground has also been carefully prepared for potential tax rises aimed specifically at the NHS.
And Mr Brown has remained largely unscathed by the rows and splits which have beset the prime minister in recent weeks.
There is no doubt he still has his sights set on Mr Blair's job.
He has strong support in the party, with every reshuffle of ministers analysed for its potential effect on the Brownite power base.
But the emergence of David Blunkett as a potential rival as a future Labour leader means Mr Brown's ambitions are by no means assured.
So his Budget will, as ever, play a big part in what happens in the future.
Eerie experts say you are twice as likely to see a UFO and three times more likely to see a ghost in Penzance, Cornwall, than in the rest of the UK.
Spook researcher Lionel Fanthorpe spent two months gathering evidence across the country.
His team found 102 supernatural sightings, including 33 ghostly visions and 23 UFO, in the Penzance area.
The high rate in the 216sq mile area has led it to be dubbed the Penzance Triangle, after the famous Bermuda Triangle - a place notorious for chilling goings-on.
Researchers rate the Yorkshire Triangle and Norfolk Triangle as the next most chilling locations in the country.
The Big Screen can be seen outside St David's Hall in the city centre

France and Russia both said they would consider evidence supplied by the United States carefully.
Iraq itself rejected Mr Bush's allegations of links to Islamic militant groups.
Meanwhile, a government spokesman in America's close ally Britain "endorsed wholeheartedly" Mr Bush's message on Iraq.
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said he welcomed Mr Bush's pledge to produce evidence at the meeting of the Security Council scheduled for 5 February.
But, in a reference to his country's long-standing opposition to unilateral military action by the US, he added that "the majority of the world community not only understands this position but shares it".
There was no immediate reaction to Mr Bush's speech from China, which along with America, Russia and France and the UK has a permanent seat on the Security Council and therefore the power of veto.
Kuwait, a key ally for the US in the event of war, appeared to endorse many points in President Bush's speech.
Defence Minister Sheikh Jabir Mubarak al-Hamad al-Sabah said the US leader was right to say that Saddam Hussein was not to be trusted.
In the breakaway Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a senior member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), Latif Rashid, predicted after the US president's speech that war would begin "in a matter of weeks, not months".
In the Gaza Strip, the spiritual leader of the Hamas group, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, accused America of being guided by Israel.
"The battle America is undertaking is designed toallow Israel to remain in the Palestinian homeland," he told Reuters news agency.
The Roman Catholic archbishop Francisco Errazuriz said divorce would threaten the family and undermine the sanctity of marriage.
Chine is one of the only two democratic countries in the world, along with Malta, that does not allow divorce.
The archbishop's annual speech at a religious service to mark the country's Independence Day reaffirmed the Church's moral position on marriage.
The speech, coming a week after the 30th anniversary of Chile's military coup, also made a strong attack on the previous military government of Augusto Pinochet.
"Never again," said the Archbishop repeatedly, referring to the 1973 military coup of Augusto Pinochet.
General Pinochet ruled Chile for 17 years and more than 3,000 political opponents were killed or disappeared.
He also said there should never be any persecution of political opponents and violations of human rights.
BBC correspondent Clinton Porteous in Santiago says the Roman Catholic Church worked hard to defend human rights during the Pinochet years.
But there was much controversy in 1987 when Pope John Paul II visited Chile, our correspondent says.
The Pope met with General Pinochet, as well as torture victims.
He preached to massive crowds about non-violence, as well as moral standards such as no sex before marriage.
Lieutenant Colonel Tim Hodgetts, a special adviser in accident and emergency medicine, will tell a conference that the people who usually provide emergency cover at big events may prefer to join the celebrations themselves for this New Year's Eve.
St John Ambulance volunteers and off-duty doctors, nurses and paramedics might not want to give up their free time on such a special occasion or simply may not be available, he will say.
But a spokesman for St John Ambulance said the organisation does not anticipate any problems at the moment.
It has, however, been preparing for New Year's Eve for some time, he said.
Hospitals have already expressed concern that they may not be able to cope with a major incident over the millennium because of their low staff levels.
But Lieutenant Colonel Hodgetts fears the impact of this on care in the field.
He organised Thursday's Pre-Hospital Immediate Care Conference in London to examine the issue.
Doctors, emergency services and event planners are expected to attend.
"The fact is that it is a very real problem that these people might not want to do that on this New Year's Eve.
"There is only a finite number of people who have the first aid training and if there are not enough of them there could be major problems.
It is estimated that an average New Year's Eve celebration in somewhere like Trafalgar Square sees nine casualties per 1,000 people.
Half of these will be injuries and the other half medical problems like asthma attacks, low blood sugar and fainting.
The conference will include a session where emergency services and event organisers respond to a "virtual reality disaster" in London on New Year's Eve.
The researchers have worked out the shape of another of the dangerous molecules the bacterium uses to attack the human body.
Patients haemorrhage and die from a form of septic shock.
Knowing the exact arrangement of the atoms in the three toxin molecules will enable pharmaceutical companies to design drug compounds that block the activity of the proteins.
Andrew Bohm and colleagues say they can see a deep "pocket" on the side of the EF protein which is crucial for its activity and could prove a fruitful target.
Current antibiotics - used to treat patients once they have become infected - are highly successful, provided they are given early enough.
India argues its per capita emissions are far lower than that of most industrialised nations.
The jump is attributed to the growth of industries such as cement production, electricity and transport.
Over the last 15 years India's economy has developed at breakneck pace.
Correspondents say that developing nations such as India and China are under pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But at climate change talks in Copenhagen in December, India did not sign up to binding targets.
Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh maintains that India's emissions are not comparable with those of the US and China.
"The emissions of the United States and China are almost four times that of India in 2007," he told the AFP news agency.
He takes a keen interest in architecture, young people, the environment and health, believing people should have access to both complementary and orthodox medicine.
The 56-year-old supported organic farming as far back as 1984, long before it became a mass consumer issue and his vociferous belief in conservation has often been ahead of the times.
The prince's view that, when King, he might change his title of "Defender of the Faith" to "Defender of Faith", to reflect multi-cultural modern Britain, cheered many.
The prince unveiled his vision for the future of the environment, farming and food during a BBC interview from his farm, Home Farm in Gloucestershire, in the autumn last year.
He said climate change should be seen as the "greatest challenge to face man" and was the issue that really worried him.
And in February 2006, he called on UK farmers to "restore the romance" in agriculture by producing high quality meat and selling it locally.
At the start of 2006, he urged more people to walk and cycle and raised concerns Britain was following the US in the consumption of fast food and exercise.
"We are perhaps not far behind our American cousins in the 'supersizing' epidemic," he said.
The Prince of Wales title carries no established or formal role and he has had to create his own by active involvement in his organisations.
His work at the Prince's Trust, created in 1976, has allowed tens of thousands of disadvantaged youngsters to set up their own businesses.
But since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, he has also been busy trying to protect his own sons - particularly Prince Harry, who has been at the centre of several media stories.
In 2002 the prince was praised for sending Harry to a drugs rehabilitation clinic for a day after the then 17-year-old apparently admitted smoking cannabis and drinking.
More recently he has had to deal with the fallout of a scuffle outside a nightclub and the Nazi costume Harry chose to wear to a fancy dress party.
And Prince Charles is no stranger to controversy in his own right.
But several stories, from his reference to the proposed National Gallery extension as a "monstrous carbuncle" back in 1984, to warnings about the risks of nanotechnology have invited criticism.
After the furore over a memo to a former PA, in which he said the UK's "learning culture" gave people hope beyond their capabilities, the prince said his comments had been "misrepresented".
The seeming acceptance by the Royal Family of the prince's new wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, has also been hard won.
But since his marriage, Camilla has accompanied her royal husband on his official duties and his happiness has become clear to a nation that until a few years ago felt largely antipathy for the "other woman".
The couple were well received in the US on a high-profile tour of the country last autumn.
During the visit, they laid a wreath in Washington in tribute to Americans killed in World War II and they also honoured victims of the 11 September attacks at Ground Zero in Manhattan.
The prince donated $25,000 (�14,000) from an architecture prize he received in Washington to help rebuild towns hit by Hurricane Katrina.
During the US visit, the prince also made an impassioned plea to US business leaders to take action on the "environmental crisis" threatening the world.
And in a post-dinner toast at the White House, Charles told President George Bush that the world looks to the US for a lead on "the most crucial issues that face our planet".
Ahead of his US tour he told CBS television channel he hoped he would be appreciated "a little bit more" for his contributions to UK life, including the Prince's Trust, after his death.
Prince Charles once said of his future role that "the most important thing will be to have concern for people and give some form of leadership".
But he has also quipped that, if he so wished, he could "simply go off and spend the rest of my life skiing".
The group leader, from Kingsland Grange School, has severe head injuries.
The Gendarmerie Nationale in Grenoble said the coach, carrying about 45 Britons, slid off an icy road.
A spokesman said it happened when the tourist party was travelling from La Grave, in the Isere region of south-east France, to Grenoble airport.
It is thought the vehicle hit rocks after skidding near the town of Mizoen.
The group of pupils, parents and teachers from Kingsland Grange Preparatory School in Shrewsbury were returning home from a skiing holiday.
There were 22 pupils plus 19 adults including parents, on the annual skiing trip.
The children, aged between 9 and 13, all escaped with nothing more than minor bumps and bruises, but the leader was seriously injured when he was thrown through the front windscreen.
They were travelling with SkiPlan, a Brighton-based tour operator which specialises in skiing.
Patricia Couchman, the company's director, said in addition to the man who was seriously injured, "two other adults were treated in hospital for suspected injuries but have been cleared by the hospital".
"All other party members were fit to travel home," she added.
The rest of the party returned to Manchester Airport on Friday afternoon.
The University and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) is consulting on plans to revise the system, so that it incorporates qualifications other than A levels.
The proposals mean that pupils who pass as little as one A level module, amounting to one sixth of a course, will receive points.
In theory, this could mean students failing to complete any A level courses could notch up enough points to gain a university place.
But Ucas says that in practice, universities will still demand specific qualifications and grades from candidates, and not just points.
"Other people have other qualifications, such as GNVQs, the International Baccalaureate, BTECs, Scottish Highers and Access courses, and the problem is that there isn't a point-scoring system for these.
"At the end of the day, universities always decide on their own entry requirements, and will still require people to have certain grades.
The proposals also include changing the ratio of points awarded for the different grades at A level.
Currently, an A grade is worth 10 points while an E is worth two.
Ucas has consulted the main educational agencies and bodies - including the Office for Standards in Education and the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals and is now consulting universities, colleges, schools and sixth form colleges.
The spokesman said any changes would be likely to be introduced for applicants set to start university courses in 2002, and would apply first to Scottish Highers and GNVQs.
But a bulletin clash is looming as ITV has bowed to pressure to reverse the move in order to fulfil its public service role.
Chris Smith said that if fewer people watched the two bulletins once they went head to head, he would look to the BBC to consider switching its slot.
"If we are seeing a diminution of news, in quality and audience of news, then I think the governors of the BBC have to think very seriously about what they are going to do," Mr Smith told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost.
ITV came under pressure from the Independent Television Commission to revert to the earlier time since making the change in March 1999.
Mr Smith said he was "determined" that both bulletins being broadcast at 10pm should not result in a similar drop off.
"What we need to see is what the head to head competition with the BBC actually reveals," he said.
Mr Smith said the onus was on the BBC to make changes because the corporation had made "the major shift to 10pm, without warning or consultation".
It wasn't quite as snappy - or spine-chilling - as "I'll be back", but for David Cameron, eager to sprinkle a bit of Hollywood stardust over the first day of his party's annual conference, it was the best he was going to get.
Action hero-turned-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had been due to appear in Blackpool in the flesh.
He was apparently a regular here during the 1970s, in his bodybuilding days.
But we had to make do with a straight-to-video link Arnold on Sunday, after political commitments confined him to base.
The "Governator" - introduced by Mr Cameron as "someone who knows a thing or two about fighting back" - set out to dispel such notions from the start.
He had to remain in California for a special session of the state legislature, he explained, dealing with "two of the biggest issues facing California" - health care reform and the state's long-term water supply.
"So I had to cancel all travel except a long-term promise to attend the Special Olympics World Summer Games in China in a few days" - and that was an organisation founded by his mother, he added somewhat unnecessarily, so he could hardly cancel that engagement.
Mr Schwarzenegger paid tribute to Mr Cameron as "a new, dynamic leader" and an "optimist" and hailed his leadership on green issues - a subject close to the Governator's heart.
The sight of the former Terminator on a giant video screen explaining how he would love to have been there in person made Sunday afternoon in the Winter Gardens feel a little like Oscars night.
Mr Schwarzenegger even indulged in a little Hollywood-style kidding around at the expense of the man drafted in to fill his shoes as guest speaker, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
"I have hurt feelings," intoned Mr Schwarzenegger in that familiar Austro/Beverley Hills accent, "that I could so easily be replaceable.
He ended by quoting Churchill - something that, as Mr Bloomberg pointed out in his speech - visiting US politicians are contractually obliged to do.
As a centre-right politician who has proved he can win elections on the green agenda, Mr Schwarzenegger is an important role model for David Cameron - and that, presumably, is why the Tories were determined to have him at their conference, video link or not.
Alloa were the sharper side in the first half, with Adam Coakley missing good chances before he pounced to score from eight yards before the break.
Peterhead's Martin Bavidge's penalty was saved by the diving Ray Jellema in the 59th minute.
Brown Ferguson slotted home in 73 minutes as the Wasps left buzzing.
Phelps swam the first leg before Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay and Klete Keller held on for victory.
But Keller finished only 14 hundredths of a second ahead after a marvellous last leg by Ian Thorpe for Australia.
The Great Britain quartet set a new national record in finishing fourth behind Italy, who claimed the bronze.
It was Phelps' second gold medal of the evening, having earlier won the 200m butterfly, and the young American was ecstatic, jumping up and down on the poolside.
"As a goal, I wanted to come in here and prove something.
"I'm not making excuses, but I feel a bit flat," said the Australian, who had been masterful on Monday night in beating Van den Hoogenband and Phelps in the intense individual race.
Simon Burnett gave Britain the ideal start, finishing his leg in third place behind Phelps and Hackett.
BA said it had approached a number of private equity companies about forming a consortium to manage a bid.
But the UK airline, which already owns 10% of Iberia, ruled out making a lone bid for the Spanish firm.
BA's announcement followed similar interest in Iberia from the German airline Lufthansa.
Iberia was "of strategic interest to Lufthansa in principle", a spokesman for Germany's biggest airline said.
Takeover rumours surrounding Iberia have seen the airline's shares soar by almost 80% in the last six months.
Analysts have said an "open skies" deal between the US and Europe is set to drive consolidation in the airline industry.
Historians have expressed dismay that the "crown jewels" of the archive of the former King's lawyer and close friend Sir Walter Monckton would not now be released until 2037.
Oxford's Bodleian Library released 10 boxes of the Monckton papers on Wednesday, but held back material in a file labelled "Box 24".
Academics have speculated that the box may contain files relating to the Queen Mother's role in the abdication crisis of 1936.
Oxford University denied it was responsible for taking the letter outand it was unclear who had removed the document or when.
The archive is understood to contain unofficial correspondence between the Queen Mother and Sir Walter, who advised Edward VIII on his abdication after only a few months as monarch.
BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Queen Mother was known to have been severely critical of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee whose relationship with Edward VIII led to his abdicating the throne.
Mr Roberts said one of missing letters from the then Queen to Sir Walter in August1940 may have been related to the arrival of Edward and Mrs Simpson in theBahamas, where the former King was to become governor.
It was sent just days after Queen Elizabeth had written to the ColonialSecretary Lord Lloyd expressing unhappiness that the Duke of Windsor was beingmade Governor of the Bahamas.
In that letter, she describes the Duchess of Windsor as a bad example forEngland and the "the lowest of the low".
Mr Roberts said that the missing letter may well have been more vitriolic intone as it was written to a confidante.
Oxford University professor of politics and government Vernon Bogdanor saidthe papers available did not contain any spectacular revelations butfilled in vital historical gaps.
Among the documents was a letter sent to Sir Walter by Buckingham Palace in January 1949.
It said that a signed statement from Wallis Simpson had been found among papers belonging to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin.
Also among the papers was a 1939 telegram from the Duke of Windsor - as Edward VIII became known - to Adolf Hitler.
The Duke is believed to have been sympathetic to the Nazis.
But Prof Bogdanor said there was "no evidence whatsoever" that the Duke had been involved in treason.
Sir Walter Monckton was Edward VIII's closest adviser at the time he took the decision to give up the throne and marry Mrs Simpson.
He drafted the legal document formalising the abdication, which stunned the nation and caused a divide within the Royal Family.
After the abdication, he acted as go-between in the increasingly acrimonious relationship between the Duke of Windsor and his brother George VI.
Arnold Hudson, 95, described the decision as a "terrible tragedy".
He spent less than �300 to secure a model before the firm began production and went on to buy 11 other Jaguars.
He met the company's founder Sir William Lyons when he delivered typewriters to its research department in Coventry in the 1930s.
And he ended up ordering a suede green car for himself.
There will be 400 voluntary redundancies at Browns Lane as production moves to the firm's plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham.
But many of the factory's 2,500 workers will transfer to Birmingham, while 310 will remain in Coventry to make wood finishes for Jaguar models.
"As a result of this plan Coventry will very much still remain the home of Jaguar and I hope we will see sufficient future investment in upskilling the current workforce.
However the mood in Allesley village, where the majority of residents work at Browns Lane, was sombre this week.
Shop supervisor Charlie West-Williams, whose parents work at the factory, admits staff face an uncertain future.
The firm says a science and business park, which already has planning permission, will be developed at Whitley in association with Coventry City Council and local enterprise agencies.
In a report on eight complaints forwarded to him by MPs between April and December last year, he said some government departments still failed to realise that they must deal with requests for information on complaints in line with the established code of practice.
"Given that the code has now been in operation for nearly seven years, there can be no excuse for this," Mr Buckley said.
But some departments were praised for their "clear and efficient" ways of following the code.
The report criticised parts of Whitehall, rejecting the claim that they risked breaching confidentiality by heeding his appeal to be more open.
He concluded that such an approach would be very much in keeping with the spirit of the code of practice.
This latest attack on secrecy in Whitehall comes as the government has been defending its proposals to ensure access to meetings and information in new cabinet-style local government, which is replacing the committee system in many local councils.
In the Commons, the Conservatives have tried unsuccessfully to block the new regulations.
Tory local government spokesman Nigel Waterson said the new cabinet-style system would "encourage a culture of secrecy and exclusion".
But Local Government Minister Hilary Armstrong insisted that the new regulations would strike a balance that would make local government both open and workable.

Drogba's goals came early in each half, the Chelsea striker deftly bringing down Asier Del Horno's pass and then clipping a volley in on eight minutes.
On 52 minutes the Ivory Coast striker shrugged off tackles from Philippe Senderos, Lauren and Jens Lehmann before guiding a rising shot home.
Cesc Fabregas quickly pulled a goal back for Arsenal, sliding the ball in after Freddie Ljungberg crossed.
A new season might have arrived, but on the evidence of Sunday's game it could be a case of same old story for Premiership holders Chelsea.
Last season Jose Mourinho's side had the meanest goals against record in the Premiership and for long periods Chelsea's defensive blanket smothered Arsenal's attack.
Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech had a typically solid game, his best save coming from Kolo Toure, pushing the central defender's shot past the post.
That it was an Arsenal defender who provided the FA Cup holders' best chance in the opening half summed up their attack's deficiencies, with Thierry Henry doing his best work out on the flanks.
For Chelsea's attack, Mourinho had left Hernan Crespo on the bench, opting to deploy Drogba as a lone striker.
Drogba had a difficult initiation into English football last season - managing just 10 Premiership goals - and over the summer he complained Mourinho had demanded too much from him in terms of defensive work.
But his goals demonstrating strength and speed highlighted why Mourinho paid �24m for him last summer.
On eight minutes Drogba was quicker to read the flight of Del Horno's pass than Senderos and after controlling the ball on his chest, the Chelsea striker struck a neat volley past Lehmann.
If Drogba's first goal was primarily a demonstration of his technique, his second was all about brute strength.
Eidur Gudjohnsen flicked on to free Drogba, who shrugged off Senderos's tackle and against all the odds remained on his feet after Lehmann and Lauren tried to clear the danger.
The Chelsea striker then had the composure to curl the ball into the roof of the net.
Eight minutes later Arsenal forced their way back into the game after Fabregas side-footed past Cech after Ljungberg crossed from the right.
With 22 minutes remaining Mourinho introduced Shaun Wright Phillips, though the former Manchester City winger had a quiet game.
The two teams renew their rivalry in a fortnight when Arsenal meet Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Premiership.
Wilshere is the youngest player to represent the club in the league and in European competition.
At the club since the age of nine, he had previously been on a scholarship.
"Jack is a player with great potential, with an ability to find the final ball and also score goals," manager Arsene Wenger told the Arsenal website.
"Jack is a passionate and committed young player, he is not afraid of tackles and I am convinced he will have tremendous penetrative power in a few years.
Wilshere made his Premier League debut against Blackburn as a substitute on 13 September 2008.
He made his first start in the 6-0 Carling Cup victory over Sheffield United 10 days later, scoring his first senior goal for the club.
McAllister stepped down from his role in order to be with his wife Denise while she undergoes treatment for an illness.
And Black, who had begun the season as McAllister's assistant, was given the job permanently on Thursday.
"We have no doubt Eric has all the right credentials to be an excellentmanager," said chairman Mike McGinnity.
Black had already taken over the reins on a temporary basis six games ago when his fellow Scotsman was granted compassionate leave.
But in the wake of McAllister's formal resignation on Monday, 42-year-old Black has been handed charge on a permanent basis until the end of the 2004-05 season.
The 30-year-old Frenchman, who can play in central defence or midfield, was signed by Black during his time in charge of Motherwell.
McGinnity also confirmed McAllister would not play any more for the club.
"Gary clearly stated to me he would not be playing again and you have to remember he was 39 on Christmas Day," said McGinnity.
Black was also quick to praise McAllister after being given his new managerial post.
"Coming down here and working alongside Gary for these past 18 months or so has given me a good grounding and now my task is to take the club forward," said Black.
The 28-year-old, who has been out of action since February, had exploratory surgery on Monday, which revealed the extent of the injury.
Tigers boss Iain Dowie admitted that losing his top scorer was a "big blow" to Hull's chances of staying up.
Dowie's side are 19th in the Premier League and four points from safety with five games remaining.
Republic of Ireland international Hunt has not yet played under Dowie, who was tasked with saving the Yorkshire club from relegation when he was appointed in place of Phil Brown on 17 March.
Hunt, who signed a four-year deal when he joined from Reading last summer, joins other influential Tigers players Anthony Gardner and Kamil Zayatte on the sidelines but Dowie remains hopeful that he has enough quality left in his squad to avoid the drop.
"Hunt, Gardner and Zayatte have been great players for the team," said Dowie.
The financial problems that have brought the Arrows team to the brink of collapse have highlighted serious concerns in the Formula One paddock.
While bad financial management at Arrows has led to that team's problems, a number of leading figures believe that there is a more fundamental reason for unease.
Some top personnel at teams across the F1 spectrum believe that the situation is indicative of a general lack of new money coming into the sport.
Arrows' problems come five months after the collapse of the French Prost team, which went bankrupt before the start of the season.
And Minardi have also admitted they are struggling to find the money to complete this season.
According to Giancarlo Minardi - former boss of Minardi, which is now owned by Australian Paul Stoddart - this is not simply an issue of the survival of the fittest in an ultra-competitive environment.
Minardi believes that F1 lacks appeal for sponsors - and that this is why teams are finding it difficult to raise the huge sums of money needed to compete.
"For me, it is a problem for Formula One, not just for the small teams," Minardi said.
"First Prost goes down, then Minardi is struggling, now Arrows - slowly it goes up the grid.
Minardi urged the teams to sit down together to find a solution - and he says that TV coverage is the place to start.
Minardi said that, with a few exceptions, there was a general lack of new sponsors in F1 and identified two problems that need to be resolved urgently to try to turn that around.
Firstly, he says that there is not an even enough split in exposure between the top teams and those lower down the grid.
This is highlighted by figures for the TV coverage from the European Grand Prix two weeks ago obtained by BBC Sport Online from another team.
This, some in F1 believe, means that many sponsors do not get sufficient return on their investment, reducing the appeal to new investors.
Secondly, Minardi says, new TV markets should be explored - chief among them China.
Minardi's view is not generally held among the top teams.
Renault team boss Flavio Briatore blamed Arrows' problems on bad management, a view shared by many other leading figures.
Minardi describes this attitude as being "on another planet".
But some senior members at big teams do agree with Minardi's view.
"People sit around squabbling over the share-out of TV money, reducing testing and sharing parts in an attempt to save money," says the commercial director of one top team.
It gave the Spanish Kelme Costa-Blanca rider his eighth victory of the season.
Spain's Isidro Nozal finished close behind Valverde, extending his lead over team-mate Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano in the overall standings by 24 seconds.
Frenchman Richard Virenque, six times winner of the King of the Mountains in the Tour de France, was expelled from the race for being towed by a team car, officials said.
The talks were set for Friday but have been cancelled until further notice.
The row over the Bay of Piran has held up talks on Croatia's accession - which is provisionally set for 2010 or 2011.
It also threatened to derail Croatia's membership of Nato, until Slovenia dropped its objections only days before this month's Nato summit.
The EU did not give a new date for talks with Croatia to resume, and said doing so would be "subject to positive development" in negotiations between Croatia and Slovenia.
They have been through a painful period of foreign interference, social change, civil war and brutal rules.
But as it turned out it became the beginning of a new era of uncertainty.
They were dreaming that from the ashes of the Taleban, a benevolent government would emerge - perhaps under the former monarch Zahir Shah who would be the embodiment of their nostalgia.
They were dreaming of a liberal age under a relaxed regime that would inject some dignity in their fragile lives and brutalised society.
What replaced the retreating Taleban was not quite that.
It was a combination of the Taleban's opponents who had ruled the country before them and whose factional fighting led to the emergence of the Taleban in the first place.
This set the tone for the future and thus Hamid Karzai emerged as the new Afghan leader.
Hamid Karzai had the luck to be accepted by all groups - the monarchists, the Islamists, the tribal chiefs and, above all, the West.
The dream for many Afghans never came true as the former monarch was forced to take a back seat.
It is now the turn of Mr Karzai to tame the very people who are his allies and with whose help he has been trying desperately to bring about some normality.
Mr Karzai has disappointed many Afghans, who see this affable tribal chief as lacking any clear strategy that could secure the emergence of a prosperous Afghanistan.
But he is not the only one to take the blame.
The international forces led by the United States are also seen to be at a loss on what to do about Afghanistan.
Afghans see all their problems as foreign-made.
They expect miracles from the international community.
Some are yearning for the certainty offered by the Taleban despite the cruelty that came with it.
A year after the Taleban, there is more freedom in Afghanistan.
But the majority of Afghans are still dreaming of a better life, a secure society and a durable government.
Sometimes it's speeding, sometimes it's providing information on how to keep themselves or their property safe, sometimes it's tourists asking directions.
Many of my tasks help free up the officers on patrol to deal with more serious jobs, for they really are stretched up here.
That's a typical example of the kind of thing I do, tasks that just improve the quality of people's lives.
They do joke that the schedule means the burglars know when not to hit the village, but I'm not here to stop crime - I'm here to be the link between the community and the police service, to pass on information to help catch criminals, and to provide support.
The most glamourous night in Hollywood takes place in Los Angeles on Sunday, and even superstars can be forgiven for feeling a little nervous.
British interest is on the actress awards, with Keira Knightley, Dame Judi Dench and Rachel Weisz all nominated.
There are also hopes Wallace and Gromit will be celebrating for a third time, in the best animated film category.
Two of the pals previous outings have won Oscars, and creator Nick Park has also won for his Creature Comfort adverts.
Wallace and Gromit are up against another stop-motion style film, Corpse Bride, and Japanese cartoon Howl's Moving Castle.
The ceremony starts at 5pm in LA, which is 1am on Monday in the UK.
Stockton favourites Russell and The Wolves are playing twice on the Saturday of the festival.
Stripping their sound down to appear on the acoustic stage at 1530 GMT before tearing up the Georgian Theatre's after-show party where they will be on stage at around 2200 GMT.
We've given them eight chances to convince you to check them out...
"Mind numbingly horrendous" (that's from an actual review)
But we prefer "Crazed rock'n'roll noise"
The Cramps, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, Billy Childish, Pussy Galore, King Khan, The Birthday Party
Ned Hogan - Clean Guitar and some pedals
Danielle Velterelle - Noise hollow body guitar and some pedals
Great Scott - a drum kit

WE DO NOT NEED A BASS GUITAR
It really means a lot being part of the best free festival in the North East, especially since we have been going for years.
It's one of those weekends where we just get really drunk and ride that weird octopus thing, throwing up our burgers and ice cream as we scream around in joy.
As two of us are Stockton born as well we feel it our duty to play and represent a more diverse side of music that is often overlooked, but quite a lot of them are playing this year.
The after show party is the best part to play, we're really pleased to be playing it again.
The Kallinger Brothers Band- two men with one brain = best garage band in Town
Idiot Savant- our favourite miserables
Bob Fischer- I'll probably join him onstage with a washboard without his permission
Education Education Education- Danielle's always ready to support fellow gin'ers
O Children- played with them in Newcastle before, singer's even taller than me
Be Quiet Shout Loud- second tallest fop round here
Kinfauns- Performed an amazing set along to Easy Rider at the Square Eyes Picture House Exhibition
British Lichen Society- They're playing acoustically? Well that should be interesting
And we'll be spending the rest of our time drunken wandering and chortling in the comedy tent.
We've got a good five or six really good gigs like our first (last minute) fringe after-show party, Bob Log III in Doc Browns, Kd Congo Powers in Newcastle, The Cave Club in Glasgow.
Our best most recent gig we played was with The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster and Bad For Lazarus at The Cluny in Newcastle, with a really packed crowd that totally got the noise, not too bluesy/punk/metal, it felt like we finally had reached the right crowd.
Every gig we play we're told something new we'd have never considered and then when you listen back, you completely agree.
Ideas and concepts of something influence me but as far as bands go at the moment it's Pussy Galore, smashing metal together, Guitar Wolf, Tom Waits, Billy Childish and Reverb Hell.
Also special mentions to bands like King Khan and BBQ show, The Ventures and Thomas Truax.
We'll have finally played with all our heroes (only King Khan, Jon Spencer and Billy Childish left) and we'll still be trying to recoup the expenses of our debut 7" single 'All Eights' which we've just self released on our label Droolsville Records which will be available for the festival.
Rosenior, who took over the club during the summer, had to wait until the 74th minute for the eventual winner.
Midfielder Skulason pounced in a busy goalmouth to sidefoot home after the Bees had improved after the break.
Blackpool were frustrated by Bees keeper Clark Masters in the first half while Keith Southern's diving header came back off the inside of the post.
Reportedly a Chelsea target last summer, the 21-year-old Spanish striker has also been linked with moves to AC Milan, Barcelona and Arsenal.
"We're not a club that sells and we have no intention of selling Torres for the sake of it," Cerezo added.
Torres, who was the youngest player to appear for Atletico and for the national team, has a contract with the club which expires in 2008.
His contract with Atletico includes a �62m buy-out clause.
Mrs Dorothy Lindsay from Wiltshire agreed with the Match of the Day panel's selection and won four tickets to see Arsenal, plus hotel, travel and �250 spending money.
The 21-year-old Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, who can play anywhere on the left flank, had a loan spell at St Mirren last season.
Carey scored three goals while on loan at St Mirren last season.
Carey scored against Georgia for the Republic of Ireland Under-21s towards the end of last season.
He made his Celtic first-team debut in December 2009 as a substitute in the Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna.
He came to the Terriers' attention when he scored against their reserve side in a friendly at Huddersfield.
"He has a terrific left foot and he looks as elegant as you would expect from a quality left-footed player," added Clark.
Waves from Hurricane Ike lash Texas coast
The National Weather Service issued the grave warning to those living in low-lying areas around Galveston Bay.
More than a million people in Texas have been advised to leave their homes before Ike hits early Saturday morning.
The storm has already killed more than 70 people in the Caribbean, with Haiti and Cuba particularly badly hit.
At 1500 GMT Ike was about 195 miles (320km) south-east of Galveston, with winds above 100 mph (160km/h).
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Ike could strengthen from a Category Two to a Category Three storm - a "major hurricane" - by the time it reaches the coast.
The effects of the storm will be felt along the coast before it makes landfall.
The hurricane's predicted path will take it through Galveston and on to the US's fourth largest city, Houston.
Forecasters warned that because of the size of the storm, the low-lying coastal areas could be hit by a 20ft (6m) high surge of water.
"All neighbourhoods and possibly entire coastal communities will be inundated during the period of the peak storm tide," the National Weather Service said in a statement.
The warning was issued after it became apparent that some residents in the Galveston Bay area were resisting orders to evacuate.
"There's more people here than I thought," Alicia Cahill, a public information officer for Galveston was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.
The Texas authorities have laid on more than 1,000 buses to facilitate the exodus.
In Galveston - scene of the country's deadliest hurricane which killed at least 6,000 people in 1900 - 75 buses are transporting residents to the state capital, Austin.
Weak and chronically ill hospital patients are being moved to San Antonio, about 190 miles from Houston.
Authorities have ordered residents in Houston to stay put, to avoid a repeat of 2005, when some 110 people in the city died during a chaotic evacuation in the face of Hurricane Rita.
Almost all energy production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut down as a precaution, but the US Department of Energy said the storm was expected to miss most of the installations.
President George W Bush has declared a federal emergency in Texas, allowing funds to be freed to help the state deal with the storm.
Hurricane Ike killed four people, wrecked tens of thousands of buildings and destroyed crops when it slammed into Cuba.
The island nation was already reeling from the impact of Hurricane Gustav, which destroyed about 100,000 homes when it hit the island at the end of August.
Ike earlier caused 66 deaths in Haiti and reportedly damaged 80% of the homes in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, has endured the onslaught of four tropical storms in a three-week period, causing more than 550 deaths.
The UN has appealed for more than $100m (�57m) in international aid to assist Haiti, where most people live on less than a dollar a day.
Washington also offered $100,000 (�57,000) in initial aid to Cuba, whose government has been subject to a US trade embargo for four decades.
Cuba turned the offer down, asking instead that the US sells it supplies on credit.
If George Bush called you "Kenny Boy" and just about everyone else you had met in your adult life called you "Sir", you would obviously be shocked and a little outraged at the thought of being locked up.
The son of a preacher who goes to church every Sunday, he is also convinced that God is behind him.
"I firmly believe I'm innocent of the charges against me," he said after the verdict.
And there was a real buzz when it emerged that both Lay and his former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, were guilty.
Her friend, who studied law, believed he was witnessing something very profound and beautiful.
One block away, audiences have been enjoying a production of Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution - a reminder how gripping a courtroom drama can be, even when the details are complicated.
But she was full of praise for the prosecution.
"Looking back they did an excellent job," she said, "so that we could understand Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling will have to make the most of this summer.
The men photographed themselves standing in the winter snow during a trip to the Golan Heights, but were also snapped by a press photographer.
Their commander was outraged and said his men would be fired for shaming the prestigious naval elite unit.
All the men had been in the unit for five years, and were due to be discharged in February.
They were not named, and their faces were blurred in the newspaper picture, because it is forbidden to identify troops in elite units.
The men's modesty was covered, too, as they stood with their hands cupped over their private parts.
The unit commander was furious, summoning the six and telling them they would be expelled from the army, military officials said.
The men's parents defended them, saying they risked their lives daily for Israel.
"I am shocked by the lack of proportions," the father ofone of the soldiers told Israel Radio.
Posing naked in the open air is reportedly a tradition in the unit, which displays the consequent photos around its headquarters.
Military officials said the final decision on whether the men would be sacked rested with the head of the navy and the chief of staff.

Scramjet stands for supersonic combustion ramjet.
It really would make space tourism a practical possibility for more people than just the super-rich.
The many bladed fans are used to compress the air prior to ignition, because at slower speeds the air is not compressed enough for efficient combustion.
Ramjets have found applications in missiles that are first accelerated by conventional rockets.
Even though a ramjet will propel an aircraft or missile at supersonic speeds, the air moving through the engine itself must be slowed to subsonic speed to enable efficient combustion.
Nasa's scramjet project is costing about $185m.
Developing practical combined-cycle engines that can switch between roles is going to take many years.
It was formed 150 million years ago when an asteroid, possibly 500m (550 yards) across and travelling at 30,000 km/h (19,000 mph), plunged into the sea off the coast of Norway.
After the initial fury, dust and other particles thrown into the atmosphere would have created a cloud that blocked out the sunlight starting a "nuclear winter".
Many species not wiped out by the initial impact would have died out during the prolonged cold and lack of sunlight in this extended winter.
The discovery of the crater in the Barents Sea was accidental, following a search for potential oil and gas reservoirs.
Geologists looked at the data more closely and concluded that it could be a parallel to the Chicxulub Crater in Mexico, the imprint left by the meteorite which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
They also found traces of the rare element iridium which is far more common in objects from space than on the Earth's surface.
Jordan Romero talks about how he has been preparing for the challenge
Jordan Romero has set off from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, to the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain.
He will begin his ascent there, along with his father and stepmother.
Jordan climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania aged 10 and wants to be the youngest person to climb the highest mountains on eight continents.
His father and stepmother have been with him on all his mountain climbs.
The current record for the youngest climber of Everest is held by Nepali Temba Tsheri, who was 16 when he reached the peak in 2001.
There have been concerns about allowing somebody of Jordan's age to make the ascent but he has said he will not take any unnecessary risks and will turn around if any problems arise.
Before he begins climbing, he will spend some weeks acclimatising at base camp.
Asked if, given the risks, a 13-year-old could make an informed decision to climb Everest, his mother, Leigh Ann Drake, told the BBC World Service that her son would be with his father the whole time.
She also said that Jordan was "not an adrenalin junkie".
"He's going to have some down-time in those tents," she said, "so why not take some books along?"
There were angry scenes as the soldiers passed
It happened as anti-war protesters held placards saying "Anglian Soldiers Go To Hell" and "Butchers of Basra".
The two, thought to be members of the public watching the parade in Luton, were held for public order offences.
The 2nd Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment, known as the Poachers, have toured Iraq twice in two years.
Two lines of police officers divided the anti-war protesters from a large number of local residents, some waving Union and St George's flags.
Police dogs and riot vans were also called to keep the two sides apart at the Homecoming Parade, organised by the borough council.
As the soldiers reached Luton Town Hall the small group of protesters shouted "Terrorists" and "Anglian Soldiers Go to Hell".
The protesters then had to be protected by police as supporters of the soldiers turned on them shouting "Scum" and "No surrender to the Taleban".
Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the actions of the protesters as "disappointing".
"That pride in our armed forces was shown once again today when thousands turned out to welcome the 2nd Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment.
Defence Secretary John Hutton also criticised the protesters.
The battalion, currently based at Celle near Hanover in Germany, recruits from several areas including Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire.
Gordon Hacker, from Rugby, conspired with inmates serving at HMP Rye Hill between November 2004 and April 2005, Northampton Crown Court heard.
Hacker, 44, tipped off inmates about the best times for accomplices to throw drugs into the prison over the prison wall, the court was told.
He was remanded on conditional bail and is due to be sentenced in December.
Hacker, 44, was charged along with four co-defendants, all of whom had already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply controlled drugs at Rye Hill.
They are Stephen McClusky and Thomas Zealand, who were inmates at Rye Hill at the time of the conspiracy, and Sheree Williams and Stephanie Zealand, the two men's girlfriends.
They are all also due to be sentenced in December.
Judge Richard Bray, presiding, described the elaborate drug-trafficking conspiracy at Rye Hill.
Drugs were then bought with the money on the outside and thrown over the prison walls at night to inmates who were waiting on the inside, the court heard.
Judge Bray told the court Hacker's involvement was "by telling them when was a good time to throw stuff over the wall, and doubtless turning a blind eye to what was going on".
Telephone records revealed that Hacker had received frequent and regular telephone calls over the four-month period from 2004 to 2005 from Stephen McClusky and Thomas Zealand.
Ms Brand told the court that although the calls often lasted no more than a few seconds, it was "enough, I suppose, for someone to say I need to speak to you, come and see me".
There was insufficient evidence to prove whether Hacker had actually brought drugs into the prison himself, or whether he realised the scale of the trafficking, the court was told.
But payments ranging from �20 to more than �800 were made into the bank account being used for the conspiracy.
The payments to the account held by Sheree Williams amounted to �6,390; and large quantities of drugs were found at the homes of Sheree Williams and Stephanie Zealand, the court was told.
The drugs included cannabis resin, ecstasy pills, diamorphine and heroin, the prosecution said.
Speaking outside the court, Det Sgt Andy Blaize of Northamptonshire Police, said postal orders were sent from "numerous" prisoners to addresses across Coventry.
In 2005, a report by the chief inspector of prisons found HMP Rye Hill to be "unsafe for staff and inmates alike".
The report of the inspection was described by the Prison Reform Trust as "one of the most damning we have ever seen".
Doherty, 28, was due to appear at Yeovil Magistrates Court to answer allegations of criminal damage.
He is accused of chasing a woman into a shop in Crewkerne, Somerset, after she took a photo of then girlfriend Irina Lazareanu in August 2007.
The Babyshambles star is now expected to appear before the magistrate later this week.
Gavin, 22, controlled the contest from the start, beating the Italian 18-10.
The win sealed an impressive tournament for England, with Bradley Saunders and Joe Murray earning bronzes this week.
All three boxers qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, while Tony Jeffries became England's fourth qualifier when he reached the quarter-finals in the light-heavyweight division.
However, Birmingham's Commonwealth gold medallist Gavin will quickly have to get used to being regarded as the Olympic favourite for his division - an accolade head coach Terry Edwards firmly believes he deserves.
"Frankie is England and Great Britain's first world champion," said Edwards.
When Steve Waugh gloved the ball away from his stumps in Chennai, he joined a small, but exclusive group.
The Australian captain became only the sixth player in Test history to be given out 'handled the ball'.
For some reason, four out of the six such dismissals in Test cricket have come in matches involving Australia.
The most memorable occurred when Andrew Hilditch was given out at the non-striker's end in 1978/79 after picking up the ball and returning it to the bowler in a Test match against Pakistan.
Waugh's dismissal in the current Test against India in Chennai was nothing like as controversial.
But the Australian captain's mind clearly went AWOL when, just as the umpire was rejecting an lbw appeal from Harbhajan Singh, the ball spun back towards the stumps and Waugh nudged it away with his glove.
A second appeal went up almost before the first had died down and this time umpire A V Jayaprakesh raised his finger.
Time will tell what significance Waugh's dismissal has on the Test match, but from a position of strength and security, Australia's first innings went into free fall.
Only some lusty hitting from Matthew Hayden took the score forward as they declined from 330 for three to 391 all out.
Waugh knows only too well what impact a "handled the ball" dismissal can have on a match.
He was a fielder when it last happened in a Test eight years ago, though the match in question is remembered more for another dismissal, when Warne put leg spin bowling back on the map by bowling Mike Gatting.
But the crucial wicket as far as Australia winning the first Test of that summer by 179 runs is concerned was that of Graham Gooch in the second innings.
Gooch, who had scored 65 in the first innings, had repelled everything the Australians could throw at him in making 133.
As the overs ticked by on the final day, England inched ever closer to safety.
Shortly after lunch, however, Merv Hughes got a ball to lift and Gooch fended it into the ground from where it bounced - apparently - towards the stumps.
Other occasions of batsmen being given out "handled the ball" have not proved so costly.
Russell Endean, a South African, was the first batsman to suffer the fate after padding up to Jim Laker in Cape Town in 1956/57 and gloving the rebound away from the stumps.
But as South Africa were dismissed for 72 in that second innings, England were always likely to win, which they did by 321 runs.
By a quirk of fate, Endean was also involved in the only instance of a batsman being given out "obstructing the field" when, in 1951, Len Hutton edged a ball from Athol Rowan into the air and then used his bat to fend it off his wicket, preventing Endean from making a catch.
Australia and Pakistan were at each other's throats again three years later in a match where Mohsin Khan was given out "handled the ball" when he knocked a ball from Jeff Thomson away from the stumps.
Crowd disturbances on the third day caused Australia to leave the field on two occasions, but Mohsin had the satisfaction of ending an acrimonious match in Pakistan's favour with a six in his second innings.
West Indian Desmond Haynes completes the list after he was sent packing for brushing away a ball from Kapil Dev that bounced and rolled slowly back towards his stumps in a Test in Bombay in 1983.
So far, of the matches in which a batsman has been dismissed "handled the ball", that is the only one to end in a draw.
The painter's "Portrait of the Artist Without His Beard" went to an anonymous telephone bidder at a huge modern art auction in New York held by the firm Christies.
The tiny 16 by 13 inch Dutch post-Impressionist painting was a birthday present for the artist's mother.
Van Gogh was still in an asylum when he painted it, and shaved off his beard beforehand to reassure his mother that he looked fit and well.
But the work was finished only very shortly before the artist's death.
A triumph for the auctioneer firm, Christie's, the result has been hailed as proof that nervousness on the art market is calming down.
Christie's estimated the work might fetch $27m as part of a huge modern art auction, but bidding doubled within minutes.
Amid gasps from the collectors and dealers gathered in the auction room, two anonymous collectors duelled for ownership as the price soared past $65m.
Auctoneer Christopher Burge said the sale showed the art market for blue chip works had bounced back.
New York Correspondent Brian Barron says many museums around the world would have liked this masterpiece, but they were left at the starting line by anonymous art-hungry tycoons with bottomless pockets.
Smartmatic, which bought Seqouia Voting Systems in 2005, and Caracas strongly deny media suggestions that President Hugo Chavez has any role in the firm.
Seqouia's machines are being used in 17 states in the November mid-term polls.
The inquiry comes amid growing concerns about the reliability of electronic voting machines in general.
Touch-screen voting is in place in 33 states, with many experts warning that the machines are easy to tamper with.
Based in the state of Florida, the software firm Smartmatic is owned primarily by three Venezuelans.
A year later, the company bought Sequoia, a US company that has been providing voting machines since the 1980s.
In May 2006, Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, asked the federal authorities to look into the takeover.
This weekend, US press reports suggested the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) had launched a formal investigation into the acquisition.
Sequoia and Smartmatic say they voluntarily submitted to a federal review.
"No foreign government or entity - including Venezuela - has ever held an ownership stake in Smartmatic, and we have voluntarily filed with CFIUS to put to rest the baseless but persistent rumours about our ownership," the firm's chief executive, Antonio Mugica, said in a statement.
The 58-year-old already faces civil charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over an alleged fraud worth $8bn (£6bn).
Sir Allen turned himself in to the FBI in Virginia and is expected to appear in a Richmond federal court on Friday.
It was not immediately clear what criminal charges Sir Allen faces.
Dick DeGuerin, Sir Allen's lawyer, told The Associated Press he had surrendered "to some FBI agents who were hiding out in black SUVs outside the residence where he was staying in Virginia".
"He walked out and asked if they had a warrant," Mr DeGuerin said.
He said Stanford told the agents to arrest him if they had a warrant, but if they did not have a warrant, he would go back to Houston to turn himself in.
In February, the SEC, the US financial watchdog, described the alleged fraud at Stanford Financial group as a "fraud of shocking magnitude".
The cricket impresario is accused by the SEC of luring investors with promises of improbable and unsubstantiated high returns on certificates of deposit and other investments - what is known as a Ponzi scheme.
The billionaire financer has refused to talk to US regulators investigating his alleged fraud, and court documents show that Sir Allen pleaded the Fifth Amendment - the right to withhold potentially self-incriminating evidence.
In an interview with ABC earlier this year he insisted no money was lost by customers dealing with his financial services companies.
"If it was a Ponzi scheme, why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place?" he said at the time.
About 30 Gibraltarians travelled to Barcelona to picket talks between UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his Spanish opposite number Josep Pique.
Gibraltar's Chief Minister, Peter Caruana, boycotted the meeting.
"This overall agreement will cover all outstanding issues, including those on co-operation and sovereignty," the statement said.
As part of the process, Spain has agreed to boost the number of telephone lines to the Rock, and to improve health services.
Mr Straw insists that no change to the status of the Rock - currently a British dependent territory - will take place without the agreement of its people in a referendum.
But Mr Pique has reiterated that his country will never renounce its claim of sovereignty - whatever the referendum results.
There has been much speculation that a deal on joint sovereignty could be in the pipeline.
BBC Europe correspondent Justin Webb says the Gibraltarians are likely to vote against any change to the Rock's current status, and that this would cause huge disappointment in Spain.
Mr Straw, who met some of the Gibraltarians protesting in Barcelona, said after the talks that he was acting in their best interests.
Both ministers urged Mr Caruana to join the talks process.
Gibraltar has been in British hands since it was seized from Spain in 1704.
Its 30,000 residents are overwhelmingly in favour of maintaining the status quo on sovereignty.
In the caf�s, on the boulevards and in the markets, it was difficult to move far without being exhorted to accept fliers urging people to mass meetings and protest marches in a show of defiance against George Bush and Tony Blair.
Newspaper stands carry titles which continue to reflect the day-to-day diplomatic wrangling that now characterises the relationship between the Elysee Palace and the White House.
But gone are the obvious signs of public unrest which saw up to 100,000 demonstrators take to the streets in mid-February as the international focus fell on the need (or not) for a second resolution endorsing a war against Iraq.
Out of sight maybe, but not out of mind.
This incident appears isolated with the focus of French anger not the citizens of Britain and the US, but the administrations.
The other was the desecration of a British WWI cemetery near Boulogne at the end of March.
If newspaper polls are anything to go by, French public opinion softened between the onslaught of the US and British forces on 20 March and the toppling of Saddam's statue in Baghdad a month or so later.
Spend even a short time strolling down famous French thoroughfares such as the Champs Elysees and it does not take long to hear American and British accents.
Despite the war and reports of some mutual cancelling of holidays on both sides of the English Channel, the love affair with Paris goes on.
Bill Reid, Church of Scotland minister at the Scots Kirk, Paris, for 10 years, took part in that anti-war demonstration in February.
He was, and remains, staunchly opposed to the conflict and said that the groundswell of French opinion was "largely against".
"I sense in a lot of people with whom I have spoken in the last 10 days, a great feeling of disillusionment and discouragement because we did all we could as ordinary citizens," Mr Reid continued.
In the latest round of verbal hostilities between Paris and Washington, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said France may suffer as a result of its stance.
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin retorted with a promise to defend international law "in all circumstances".
"I think there was quite a considerable time when people placed a great deal of hope on Colin Powell being one of the more sensible of the George Bush entourage, a person of integrity who would try his very best to achieve peaceful solutions.
But the United Liberation Front of Assam denied it killed four people in a bombing of a marketplace near state capital Guwahati on Sunday.
Police had blamed Ulfa for the bombing at a bus stop in Boko, 40km (25 miles) west of Guwahati.
Ulfa has been fighting for a separate Assamese homeland for two decades.
Analysts say the group often steps up attacks ahead of India's independence day on 15 August.
Assam police intelligence chief Khagen Sarmah told the BBC he was sure the Ulfa was behind all the attacks.
"No other group in Assam has the capacity to set off explosions at such distances within hours of each other in such a synchronised manner, only the Ulfa can do it and they have a reason for doing it now," he said.
The military wing chief of Ulfa, Paresh Barua, told the BBC its fighters had carried out the pipeline attacks.
An attack on Sunday at Chellakapar, in Assam's northern district of Sibsagar, destroyed part of a pipeline of the state-owned Oil India Limited.
About 12 armed rebels overpowered the guards at midnight and set off explosives by remote control.
It took several hours to control the fire and it would take a few days to repair the pipeline, said general manager (services) of Oil India, AK Bhandari.
Analysts say efforts to open a dialogue between the Indian government and Ulfa have almost fallen through after Delhi refused to release 10 senior rebel leaders.
"If [Delhi] is sincere about talks, our senior leaders should be released so that we can form a consensus within our organisation about how to go about the talks," Mr Barua said.
The diary's spelling is erratic and its grammar irregular, but this does not detract from the bravery of Sgt Bagshaw nor the gripping account of his time as a prisoner of the Germans, towards the end of the war.
Written over 31 pages in black ink in what appears to be an exercise book, the diary covers his capture , the banality of camp life, the poor quality and scarcity of food, the brutality of some of the German guards and also has flashes of dark humour.
Anthony Richards, archivist at the Imperial War Museum in London has examined a copy of the diary and picked out some passages of interest.
A spokeswoman said it was Channel 4's highest rating drama since 2001.
Audience figures also showed that C4's final series of Celebrity Big Brother went out on a high, beating last year's finale shows.
The 27-year-old scored an excellent individual goal in the 1-1 draw against champions Chelsea on Saturday.
"In the last two months he's come on leaps and bounds and he's given defenders an awful time.
Didier Drogba equalised for Chelsea after Walters' early opener at the Britannia Stadium.
It was the first time that Stoke had picked up a point against Chelsea in six Premier League meetings between the two teams.
Indian garment exporters have warned of plunging earnings following last week's decision by the European Union to remove all tariffs and offer increased quotas to clothing exports from Pakistan.
Pakistan is India's main competitor in the garment markets of EU and US.
Indian clothiers fear the EU's move will hurt Indian exporters all the more, as both countries offer the West more or less similar clothing lines.
Both India and Pakistan are cotton producing nations, and their garment industries are largely based around cotton and knit wear products.
"If the US also offers similar concessions to Pakistan, then the Indian garment exporters are doomed as nearly 70% of our exports go to European and American markets," Rajiv Takru, director-general of India's Apparel Export Promotion Council, told BBC News Online.
Under the EU's new conditions, imports from Pakistan will be increased by 15% until 2004.
The rise in quotas is expected to boost Pakistani exports to Europe by $1bn over the next four years.
The removal of tariff is also likely to eliminate duties to the tune of $150m a year.
"Pakistan's gain will be India's loss," Mr Takru said.
The other two major South Asian garment exporting countries - Sri Lanka and Bangladesh - already enjoy a duty free access to these markets.
The garment export industry, worth nearly $6bn a year, brings in 17% of India's foreign exchange earnings, and the prospect of these earnings being reduced because of trade concessions to Pakistan has raised fears within the Indian government.
India's textile secretary, Anil Kumar, convened a meeting of senior textile ministry officials and representatives of garment exporters Monday afternoon in Delhi to discuss possible measures the government can take to save the situation.
"The government has decided to take up the issue with relevant EU officials," Mr Takru told the BBC.
EU's concessions to Pakistan, which Indian officials believe is the result of Pakistan emerging as a front ranking ally of the West in the fight against terrorism, has come at an inopportune time for Indian garment exporters, who were already feeling the pinch of a global slowdown.
According to Raju Goenka, president of the India's Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), exports were already down 18% in the first half of the current financial year.
"Now exports are almost certain to dip further," he said.
This new face off with developed countries is causing considerable frustration in the Indian textile exporters' lobby, which has also been trying to fight what it views as an unfair deal to the developing world in terms of trade concessions.
According to Arvind Pradhan, a senior AEPC director, developing nations have been getting a raw deal under the World Trade Organisation regime.
"We have long been promised that a number of quantitative restrictions will go and the quota system will be phased out gradually in textile exports," Mr Pradhan said.
"The Kyoto Protocol places significant limitations on the economic growth of Russia," presidential aide Andrei Illarionov has announced in Moscow.
The landmark environmental pact cannot now enter into legal force, especially since the US has also repudiated it.
It means the protocol will either have to be renegotiated or the nations that have signed will have to go it alone.
The Russian decision will come as a devastating blow to many of the delegates at a meeting of the signatories to the United Nations Climate Change Convention, being held in Milan this week.
The protocol requires industrialised countries to cut their emissions of six gases which scientists believe are exacerbating natural climate change.
But many scientists say cuts of around 60-70% will be needed by mid-century to avoid runaway climate change.
The protocol would have entered into force when 55 signatories had ratified it, including industrialised countries responsible for 55% of the developed world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 1990.
Some critics say President Bush's decision that the US, which emits more greenhouse gases than any other country, would not ratify the protocol had already condemned it to irrelevance.
But enough other signatories have done so for it to have entered into force if Russia, another big polluter, had decided to ratify.
Each country's emission reduction targets were set in 1990, when the Soviet Union's heavy industries were still pumping out huge amounts of pollution.
Russia (and most of the states of the former Soviet bloc) cannot now afford either the industries, or even the fuel that drove them.
So Moscow has the notional right, under the protocol, to emit vast quantities of "paper" pollution which will never leave a factory chimney.
What it can do is sell its unused emission entitlements to industrialised countries which are close to exceeding their own allowances, and this could be a very lucrative trade.
Throughout first the US and now Russian refusal to ratify the protocol, the European Union has remained an enthusiastic advocate of its potential.
The EU Environment Commissioner, Margot Wallstrom, commenting on an announcement by the European Environment Agency that the EU was on course to miss its targeted emission cuts, remained resolutely hopeful.
A few minutes later came Mr Illiarionov's bombshell, tempered only slightly by his qualification that Russia would not ratify the protocol "in its present form".
One of the criticisms of Kyoto made by the US and others is that it requires only industrialised countries to make emissions cuts.
The developing countries are exempt for the moment, though negotiations were due to start soon on the cuts they will soon have to make.
Half of the prize goes to John Hall of Colorado University and Theodor H�nsch of Germany's Max Planck Institute.
The laser-based spectroscopy they pioneered allows the colour of light from atoms and molecules to be determined with exceptional precision.
The other half goes to Roy Glauber of Harvard University for applying modern quantum principles to laser optics.
Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.
Profesor Glauber's work goes back to the 1960s, when he developed theories that explained the extraordinary properties of laser light in terms of modern quantum physics - which is governed by probabilities.
This enabled him to describe the fundamental differences between hot sources of light such as light bulbs, which produce a mixture of frequencies and phases, and lasers, which give a specific frequency and phase.
Decades later, building on Glauber's work, Hall and H�nsch developed a high-precision technique called the optical frequency comb.
This is generated by a laser specially designed to produce a series of extremely short - a few billionths of a second - equally spaced pulses of light.
It allowed Hall and H�nsch to measure the colour emitted or absorbed by atoms and molecules, and opened a new window for precision instrumentation.
Their laser technology makes it possible to track frequencies with an accuracy of fifteen digits.
With such fine scales, scientists are now producing super clocks that would lose only one second in the age of the Universe.
They are even running the rule over the constants of nature to see if they change over time.
Professor H�nsch is even using the technique to see how antimatter - the stuff of science fiction rocket engines - differs from normal matter.
Dr Hall is currently a fellow and senior research associate at Jila, a joint institute of the University of Colorado at Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist).
General John de Chastelain said he does not want to sound unrealistically optimistic but believes there is still time to meet the decommissioning of deadline of May 2000.
General de Chastelain's comments come as both unionists and nationalist politicians have been briefing their parties on the state of the Mitchell review, following several days of intense negotiations in London.
The main pro-Agreement parties are due to return to the review at Castle Buildings in Belfast on Friday.
The UK Government asked former US Senator George Mitchell to chair a review of the peace process in July after the Ulster Unionists refused to form a government with Sinn Fein because the IRA would not start decommissioning.
Sinn Fein say IRA decommissioning is not a precondition of the agreement.
Scottish Liberal Democrat Mike Pringle has called for the levy in an attempt to cut down on waste.
Mr Pringle said the Republic Ireland has introduced a tax which has proved a success and a scheme has also been proposed in the English city of Durham.
Plastic bag usage from shops and stores has been reduced by an estimated 90% in the Republic of Ireland and the tax has raised millions of euros in revenue.
The MSP said local authorities would be responsible for implementing the levy and the money would go back to councils for use in environmental projects.
Mr Pringle said there was evidence to suggest support from supermarkets.
Mr Pringle said party colleague and Environment Minister Ross Finnie was "encouraged" by the bill.
He said he has received support from Lib Dem MSPs and has called for backing from other parties.
The Scottish Greens said they welcomed Mr Pringle's decision to "pick up on" one of their own manifesto ideas.
They said they were concerned that the bill fell short of what was required to make it work but that they were prepared to work to improve it.
However, Mr Pringle's plans were criticised by the Carrier Bag Consortium, which is made up of manufacturers opposed to a tax.
Private and voluntary organisations and the city council will be invited to support those on long-term incapacity benefits back into work.
In return they will be allowed to keep money that would previously have been paid to claimants.
It is part of UK Government plans to get more than a million people off benefits and back to work.
The proposals, contained in a white paper published on Wednesday, would force people on benefits to do something in return for their money.
Those who refused to co-operate could have their benefits cut.
Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy confirmed that Scotland's biggest city would join Lambeth, Norfolk and Manchester as a "test bed" for the welfare "revolution".
Birmingham is expected to be named as the fifth pilot area.
"Glasgow has made a huge amount of progress but a lot more can be done.
In return for successfully getting people back into work, those behind the programmes would get a proportion of the money the government saves in no longer having to pay out benefits.
Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell welcomed the reform proposals but said more could still be done.
"For example, we have been in discussion with the Department of Work and Pensions to create greater flexibility around the '16-hour rule' which prevents unemployed people from taking training courses which would help them into a job, because it would mean them losing their benefits.
"I am delighted the DWP has decided to allow the long-term unemployed to take training courses of up to eight weeks, but here in Glasgow longer courses are also required so that we can help those furthest from the job market into employment.

The burial followed a funeral service at St George's Chapel attended by political leaders, statesmen and diplomats.
World leaders and ordinary people alike laid wreaths on the lawns to pay their respects to the former King, who caused a constitutional crisis in 1936 by abdicating the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
Inside St George's Chapel a procession of eight soldiers from the first battalion the Welsh Guards carried the coffin, draped in the Duke's personal standard.
It was followed by the Duke of Edinburgh, King Olaf of Norway - a cousin of the Duke - the Prince of Wales and other male members of the royal family.
Apart from the Duke's only surviving brother the Duke of Gloucester, who was not well enough to attend, all other adult members of the royal family were there.
The half hour service, conducted by the dean of Windsor, ended with a blessing by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
The Duke was later buried next to his brother the Duke of Kent, at the royal burial ground at Frogmore, half a mile from the castle.
Following the death of his father, George V, in January 1936 Edward became King.
But Edward had fallen in love with American divorcee Wallis Simpson and was determined that he would marry her.
Opposition from his family and the government effectively forced him to choose between Mrs Simpson and the office of King.
He chose to abdicate, announcing his decision on radio, and on 10 December, just 11 months after becoming King, he left England under his new title the Duke of Windsor.
Tottenham led 2-0 at United on Saturday when Webb ruled Heurelho Gomes had fouled Michael Carrick, and the hosts went on to win the match 5-2.
"I never want to have a negative impact on a game and I get no pleasure from not reaching the high standards we set ourselves.
Meanwhile, it has emerged Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas could face disciplinary action over his comments about Webb's decision.
The Football Association has given him seven days to respond to his remarks in which he said Webb had "crumbled under pressure".
The Republic of Ireland Under-21 international will team up with former manager Joe Royle at Boundary Park.
Town have signed Polish keeper Bartosz Bialkowski, 21, from Southampton on loan until the end of the season.
"Being number two is the worst position in football and Shane needs games," Ipswich boss Jim Magilton told BBC Radio Suffolk.
Supple is out of contract this summer and has struggled for first-team football opportunities this year due to the good form of first-choice keeper Richard Wright.
Bialkowski has made 19 senior appearances for Southampton, where he worked with former Town goalkeeping coach Malcolm Webster.
England's Sarah Price produced a world-class performance to win the 100m backstroke final.
A tearful Price said how much she had improved since her poor performance at the Sydney Olympics.
Price said she had to concentrate hard to keep Calub at bay.
Illinois Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, 48, is also known for his tough and aggressive style in the political arena, and has been dubbed "Rahmbo" by some US media.
A dedicated family man with a wife, Amy, and three young children, Mr Emanuel has publicly pondered the impact on his family of accepting the chief-of-staff role - a job involving long days and high pressure.
Some Washington observers have portrayed Mr Emanuel as the "bad cop" to Mr Obama's "good cop".
He has had a rapid rise up the party hierarchy since his election in 2002 as congressman for Illinois' Fifth District in Chicago.
In his second term Mr Emanuel served on the House Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing taxes, trade, Social Security and Medicare issues.
He was appointed to serve as Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2006.
Under his leadership, the Democrats gained 30 seats in the House of Representatives, allowing them to gain control of the House after 12 years of Republican control.
In 2007, he was elected to serve as the Democratic Caucus Chair, the fourth highest ranking Member of the House Democratic Leadership.
Stories of Mr Emanuel's focus and determination are widespread around Washington and Chicago, and he has developed a reputation as an aggressive operator.
A practising Jew, Mr Emanuel's Israeli heritage has prompted positive headlines in Israel, where some were concerned earlier in the election campaign about the likely direction of Mr Obama's Middle East policy
Rahm Emanuel's father, Benjamin, is an Israeli-born doctor who was once a member of the Irgun, a hard-line group which fought for Israeli independence until 1948 as was branded as a terrorist organisation by the British colonial authorities.
The prospective chief-of-staff himself volunteered to serve in Israel's army during the first Gulf War of 1991 - rust-proofing brakes in northern military bases, Israeli media reports.
Back in the US, Mr Emanuel became the director of finance for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992.
He then went on to serve as a senior adviser to President Clinton from 1993 to 1998 - first as an assistant to the president for political affairs and then as senior adviser for policy and strategy.
After his time in the Clinton administration, Mr Emanuel became a managing director for a leading global investment bank in Chicago, reportedly earning $16m.
Mr Emanuel worked on Paul Simon's 1984 US Senate election and served as an adviser and chief fundraiser for Chicago Mayor Richard M Daley in 1989.
Profiling Mr Emanuel in Rolling Stone magazine in 2005 - in an article headlines The Enforcer - former Clinton staffer Paul Begala described Mr Emanuel's presence in Congress in reverential terms.
James Carville, who ran Bill Clinton's 1992 election campaign, is another who has backed Mr Emanuel to succeed as chief-of-staff.
Chief executive Steve Lewis said when times were tough "people don't want to be seen drinking champagne as much".
The weaker pound, strong euro, and rising fuel costs also led to a sharp decline in sales and profit in Majestic's operations in France.
The retailer said it had introduced 60 new products in the run up to Christmas, including an increased number of sparkling wines.
The European Court of Justice says it is up to the airline to prove that the circumstances are "extraordinary".
Such circumstances would include a defect revealed by the manufacturer or acts of sabotage or terrorism, the court in Luxembourg said.
It was ruling on a claim against Alitalia by an Austrian family.
An engine defect on an Alitalia plane meant that the Austrian couple were unable to take their scheduled flight from Vienna to Brindisi via Rome, and the Italian carrier transferred them to an Austrian Airlines flight instead.
Alitalia refused to pay the plaintiff, Friederike Wallentin-Hermann, compensation of 250 euros (�235; $350) and 10 euros for telephone charges, a court statement said on Monday.
The plaintiff took Alitalia to court in Vienna, and the Austrian Commercial Court asked the European Court to define the concept of "extraordinary circumstances" that could exempt an airline from paying compensation.
The European Court, whose rulings are binding on EU member states, said "technical problems which come to light during maintenance of aircraft or on account of failure to carry out such maintenance do not constitute, in themselves, 'extraordinary circumstances'".
The oak tree outside the Priaulx Library in St Peter Port is thought to be at least 145 years old.
An inspection from the Environment Department has revealed that it has two fungal infections.
Chief librarian Amanda Bennett said a new tree will be planted in place of the old one, paid for by sponsorship the library has received.
It was the first time he had ventured outside Ramallah since the Israelis lifted their five-month siege of his headquarters on 2 May.
Mr Arafat told supporters in Nablus that a Palestinian state would be established with Jerusalem as its capital.
At the weekend, Israel's dominant party, Likud, ruled against ever allowing the Palestinians statehood.
Crowds turned out to meet the veteran Palestinian leader but a planned visit to the Jenin refugee camp had to be cancelled amid fears for his security.
"Jerusalem is the capital of our independent state of Palestine, never mind who agrees or does not," Mr Arafat told a crowd of 300 in a hall in Nablus.
Likud's rejection of statehood amounted to the destruction of the Oslo peace accords, he said earlier.
In Bethlehem, Mr Arafat visited the Church of the Nativity where Palestinian militants were holed up for more than five weeks before a deal was reached last week on their release.
He entered the church escorted by armed bodyguards and priests, remarking that the place would never be forgotten by Palestinians.
Mr Arafat had planned to see the battle-scarred refugee camp in Jenin but his security officials decided against it as crowds swelled around the podium erected for him inside.
On a visit to Jenin's town hall, Mr Arafat embraced relatives of a militant leader, Yusuf Qabha, who was among about 50 Palestinians Israel says it killed there - a figure hotly disputed by the Palestinians.
He compared the battle in the camp to the Nazis' siege of Soviet cities, referring to the camp as "Jeningrad".
The Likud resolution was passed against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's wishes at a stormy central committee meeting on Sunday.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell stressed on Monday that he believed Mr Sharon was committed to an eventual Palestinian state despite the vote.
"I don't think it changes Prime Minister Sharon's basic thinking about this subject where he was inclined to move forward to a Palestinian state at some point in the future," said Mr Powell.
The vote was a victory for Mr Sharon's party rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, who had tabled the motion.
The resolution will govern future actions of Likud ministers, but it is not clear whether it is binding on Mr Sharon, who leads a broad-based coalition which includes Labour ministers who favour a Palestinian state.
Mr Netanyahu insisted that Sunday's vote was not intended to unseat Mr Sharon, saying the prime minister was "greatly respected".
In another development, Defence Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer told parliament on Monday that an expected security operation against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip had been called off after suspects were reported to have fled.
He also urged a "diplomatic solution" to the conflict with the Palestinians, saying that otherwise there would be new attacks on Israel "as bad as or worse than" the suicide bombing in Rishon Letzion which killed 15 people last week.
"Will there be a third intifada [uprising]? This is the start of it," the unemployed Palestinian said as young men from his Jerusalem neighbourhood, Issawiya, pelted armed Israeli riot police with stones and fireworks.
The numbers involved were not huge - hundreds of Palestinians, not thousands - but the clashes were widespread, with similar scenes played out at several locations across East Jerusalem.
Palestinians at the scene gave a range of reasons for their anger, but there was one common theme - a growing feeling that they are being squeezed out of Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, where they want the capital of their future state.
Emotions are running high over the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, in Jerusalem's heavily contested walled Old City.
The site on which it is situated, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as Temple Mount, is Judaism's holiest site and is next to the Western Wall where Jews from around the world come to pray.
Police had halted a plan by a right wing Jewish fringe group to enter the mosque compound, but still the call from Palestinian leaders to "defend al-Aqsa" had gone out.
A synagogue was re-opened on Monday in the Old City.
It is in the Jewish quarter, several hundred metres from the Muslim holy site, but was still cited as a source of anger.
And, Israel enraged both the Palestinians and its own ally, the US, last week, by pushing forward with plans for 1,600 homes in a Jewish neighbourhood in East Jerusalem just as US vice president was visiting to launch indirect peace talks.
With tensions high, under a security clampdown, Israel has refused men under 50 access to the al-Aqsa for the past five days, and stopped Palestinians crossing from the West Bank into Jerusalem.
"The people here are fed up, they cannot take it anymore," said Mr Dari.
"Every time they talk about peace, the answer from the Israeli government is more buildings [in East Jerusalem] and more closures," said Rida Zamamiri, 25, also watching the clashes.
"If you shut a cat in a room, what will happen? It will fight to get out," he says.
Outside the Old City itself, rows of Israeli police vehicles filled the car parks.
The limited number of Palestinians allowed to head for the al-Aqsa compound passed through police barriers, their ID cards checked by the numerous armed police.
In the Jewish quarter, school parties wove their way past buskers as business went on as usual.
Workmen were finishing the courtyard in front of the recently rebuilt synagogue.
And religious students with black boxes containing Torah scrolls strapped to their foreheads carried in furniture.
"There is absolutely no connection between the riots and this opening," said Nissim Arzy, manager of development and reconstruction in the Old City's Jewish Quarter.
He blamed extremist Palestinians for "propaganda", blowing tensions far out of proportion.
He was keen to give a detailed history of the synagogue, which has been destroyed twice, most recently by Jordanian forces during the war that began in 1948 after the creation of Israel.
And Mr Arzy denied there was ever a plan for right-wingers to enter the al-Aqsa compound.
He pointed out that some rabbis forbid Jews from even setting foot on the area - which they call Temple Mount - because as the site of the ancient Jewish temple it is considered holy ground.
But Boris Tuman, 19, a student at a Jewish seminary in the Old City, argued passionately for their right to do so, dismissing Palestinian anger over the synagogue's opening as "an excuse to riot".
Like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he maintains Jerusalem is Israel's eternal, undivided capital.
"The US would never be asked to divide Washington, France would never be asked to divide Paris, why should Israel be asked to divide Jerusalem?" he asks.
It is not an opinion all Israelis share - but it is a view Palestinians fear currently has the political upper hand.
David Cameron takes over as PM

The Cardiff-born singer said the station was a "slaughtered lamb" being thrown to silence the critics.
The channel featuring new artists and archive tracks has been earmarked for closure as the BBC aims to save £600m.
The former Catatonia star - who has been a presenter on 6 Music - said it was a prime example of the BBC's duty to provide distinctive services.
"It's precisely the kind of station that the BBC can provide but the commercial sector cannot because it doesn't appeal to the mainstream," she said.
"A commercial station is going to have to appeal to the mainstream to get its ratings.
BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced on Tuesday that digital radio stations 6 Music and the Asian Network would close as part of a strategy review to save £600m a year to reinvest in a more tightly focused range of programmes and services.
But Matthews disputed the suggestion that 6 Music's type of programming could be provided by other BBC stations such as Radio 1 and Radio 2.
"He's talking about two completely different audiences - one that likes mainstream pop, the other that is very intelligent, of a discerning taste, that likes specialist music, varied music and brand new music.
The 36-year-old former French international was announced to the media as the successor to Alex McLeish at a Friday lunchtime press conference.
Sauzee will be the senior partner in a management team with former Under-21 coach Donald Park after being offered an 18-month contract.
The popular Frenchman, who has recently been dogged by an Achilles injury, announced that he will not resume his playing career and will concentrate solely on the management of the Easter Road side.
"I am very happy and very proud as well to be manager here," said Sauzee.
"I'm not afraid and I'm delighted to work for the club.
"We have repeatedly said that we were in no hurry to make an appointment but it was the board's intention to meet with Franck and discuss the position," he said.
Sauzee returned on Thursday from France, where he was having treatment on his Achilles injury.
The French playmaker became a fans' favourite at the club since hisarrival on a free transfer from Montpellier in February 1999.
The promotion of Sauzee from club captain to the dugout will be welcomed by Hibs fans.
But the speed of the appointment will come as a surprise considering the Easter Road board only met on Thursday night with a view to drawing up a shortlist and because the Frenchman has no previous coaching experience.
Park took over as caretaker for the 1-1 draw with Rangers at Ibrox on Wednesday after McLeish moved to the Glasgow club.
But Park was then widely quoted as saying that he did want the job permanently and was looking forward to again working with the club's younger players.
The formal launch was due to take place on Wednesday, a spokesperson said.
The announcement came as the Chinese government said Google and other foreign firms must obey the country's laws and traditions.
Google said last week that it had been targeted in a sophisticated cyber attack thought to originate in China.
The attacks were thought to target the e-mail accounts of human rights activists.
As a result, the company said that it would no longer censor search engine results in China even if it meant it had to shut down operations in the country.
Google had planned to launch two handsets running its Android operating system in cooperation Samsung and Motorola.
"The launch we have been working on with China Unicom has been postponed," said a Google spokesperson.
China Unicom is a network provider in the country.
The news comes as foreign journalists based in Beijing claim to be the latest victims of China-based cyber attacks.
According to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China's website (FCCC) emails from their Gmail accounts "were being forwarded to a stranger's address".
It also issued a checklist for its 400 members to help them secure their Gmail accounts.
Human rights organisation Reporters Without Borders said it was "deeply disturbed and outraged" by the attacks.
Reporters Without Borders said the compromised e-mail accounts constituted "a serious violation of their privacy, their professional work and their freedom to provide news and information".
"The hackers who targeted foreign journalists based in Beijing were probably trying to get contact details and information about the human rights activists who talk to the international press," it said in a statement.
"We firmly condemn these attacks and we call on the ministry of industry and information technology to provide an explanation," it added.
It also criticised Microsoft for failing to follow Google's tough stance.
Microsoft admitted that its Internet Explorer browser was a weak link in the recent attacks on Google's systems.
As a result, the governments of France and Germany have warned their citizens to switch to a new browser such as Firefox or Google's Chrome.
The study - the largest ever of its kind and the first major research to look at people before they develop Alzheimer's - followed 6,870 men and women aged 55 and over.
None of the people had Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, before the study by the Erasmus Medical School in Rotterdam began.
Over a two-year period, any who developed signs of dementia were assessed and, where possible, given a brain scan.
A total of 146 people developed dementia during the course of the study, with 105 being diagnosed as having Alzheimer's.
They were also more likely to get Alzheimer's at a younger age.
However, the researchers found that smoking does not increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's for people with a gene linked to the disease.
Indeed, they believe smoking may offer protection against the disease for people with the gene - APOE epsilon 4.
"It seems that if you have the gene, you're better off if you smoke," saidDr Monique Breteler, one of the senior researchers.
The Dutch researchers said this could be because smoking altered the chemistry of the brain and defused some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
Another reason could be the fact that many smokers do not live long enough to develop the disease, which particularly affects the very elderly.
Dr Anthony Mann, an expert in the treatment of elderly people from the Institute of Psychiatry in London, said the new research presented "powerful" evidence.
Here, people in India discuss whether the formation of a new state is the answer to the region's problems and what repercussions it could have for the rest of the country.
My school friends still live in our village, working as farmers, fishermen or tradesmen.
Telangana has lots of fertile land, which can become productive by the region utilising its rightful share of the river waters, which are currently being misused by the Andhra region.
The creation of a new state will be good as the funds allocated for development will be used for development.
States were created in the 1950s on the basis of languages spoken in different areas.
I believe in unity, not in division based on lack of development.
This will fulfil the political ambitions of a few people, but it will harm the interests of common people.
What benefits have we seen from the formation of new states, like Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand? Let politicians learn the lessons from previous experiences.
If Telangana was formed as a separate state back then, it would be even more backward than it is now.
Reverend Joanne Jepson began legal proceedings against the force after they failed to take action over the termination of an unborn child which had a cleft palate, after the normal 24-week limit.
Miss Jepson, who was herself born with a jaw deformity which was corrected with surgery, claims a cleft palate is not a sufficient reason for a late termination to be carried out.
The curate of St Michael's Church in Chester also wants a High Court ruling that a cleft palate is not a serious handicap.
The initial application for a judicial review was rejected by a High Court judge last month but the application will be renewed on 1 December.
He added that it would be inappropriate to comment further while judicialproceedings were ongoing.
A spokeswoman for Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust declined to comment.
Six other men and a woman are being questioned about his killing and that of Joe Jones, whose beaten body was discovered in Ardoyne.
One woman being questioned in the Irish Republic has since been released.
Gardai are still questioning three other men.
The PSNI are holding four men and a woman over the killings.
Police said the killings took place against the backdrop of tension within dissident republicanism.
The organisation has published a handbook that attacks the way asylum seekers are dispersed around the country and forced to buy goods with vouchers.
The policies have been central planks in Labour's efforts to forge a "firm but fair" system for refugees.
But the BMA says they have been cut off from support groups and doctors have been left struggling to cope with the needs of vulnerable people arriving in communities without warning.
The government has come under further pressure from 28 of its own backbenchers who signed a Commons motion attacking the voucher system as "stigmatising and degrading".
They called on ministers to abandon it "without delay" and return to the system of benefit support.
Both developments come shortly after Downing Street countered claims Labour had been using the race issue to stifle debate on its policy on asylum seekers.
On publication of its handbook the BMA said it "deplores the hardening of attitudes towards asylum seekers in this country".
Overall the handbook is aimed at helping doctors deal with human rights violations they encounter anywhere in the world.
It will almost certainly ensure the race row sparked by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook last week rumbles on.
On Monday Home Secretary Jack Straw attacked William Hague for being too "weak" to contain Conservative splits on race.
At the same time Downing Street played down the failure of some Labour MPs to sign the Commission for Racial Equality's anti-racism pledge by saying there had been no edict on the issue.
A fierce political row developed when the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo and several other Tory MPs refused to sign it.
Immelman is recovering after a string of health problems
Tiger Woods shot 71 to edge back to one under, while co-overnight leader Justin Rose collapsed to 78 for two over.
Rose, 27, ran up a triple-bogey eight at the par-five 15th after finding water.
Americans Stewart Cink (69) and Arron Oberholser (70) and champion 2003 champion Mike Weir (70) of Canada ended three under with two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen (71) and England's Lee Westwood (73) on two under.
Immelman, the 2006 PGA Rookie of the Year, returned to competition in January just six weeks after surgery to remove a non-cancerous tumour from his diaphragm.
"I realised that it can be taken away from you real fast," said Immelman, who also missed part of 2007 with a stomach parasite.
The forecast for Saturday is heavy rain and possible storms and Immelman admitted he was relieved to post a competitive score.
Flesch shot a 67, the lowest round of the tournament so far, Poulter added a 69 to his opening 70, while two-time champion Mickelson picked up four shots in a 68.
England's Casey also shot a three-under 69, while countryman Lee Westwood remained in touch with a 73 for two under despite a double bogey at the par-five 13th.
Making it four Englishmen in the top 15 was debutant Nick Dougherty, who fired four birdies in his last six holes to add a 69 to his opening 74 for one under alongside Fiji's Vijay Singh and American Jim Furyk.
The cut fell at three over, meaning the likes of Ernie Els, Sergio Garcia, Luke Donald, Fred Couples and Jose Maria Olazabal all missed out on the weekend.
But Open champion Padraig Harrington made it on one over, while 50-year-old former champions Ian Woosnam and Sandy Lyle also squeezed in at two and three over respectively.
Woosnam, the 1991 champion, made his first cut in the Masters since 2000, a year after he feared he might never play in the event again because of back and health problems.
"It's nice being a senior - you just hit the ball and don't get nervous," said the former European Ryder Cup captain.
Henderson took Mossie Lawlor's inside pass to touchdown on 69 minutes.
Dragons full-back Kevin Morgan scored a stoppage-time try but the boot of Paul Burke already had the Irish province in a commanding lead.
Ex-Harlequins fly-half Burke landed six penalties as well as converting the Henderson try.
Burke and Craig Warlow were engaged in a penalty shoot-out in the first half,with the Munster man edging his team into a 9-6 interval lead.
The right boot of Warlow landed a 40-metre drop goal to square it up on 48 minutes.
Burke's fourth penalty from in front of the posts pushed Munster back in frontwith half an hour remaining and two more on 65 and 68 minutes had the Dragons'six-game run under serious threat.
But, with Munster gunning for a second try, wily Morgan sneaked away on a60-metre breakaway to claim a try at the death.
Munster are now in third in the table, level with the second-placed Dragons on 26 points.
These days the news is instant, isn't it?
These are the facts as many of us heard them.
Terreblanche seemed, as Shakespeare might have put it, like "a man who scarce confessed that his blood flowed, or that his appetites were more to bread than stone"; and was the very embodiment of his supremacist ideology.
And the news of his demise, such as it was, spread like a veld fire over discussion boards, status symbols and YouTube clips, as the internet made the emotion of this moment in history quite viral.
The two young murderers were suddenly lost in this emotion, and no-one said much about them for a while and the facts of their dispute with their boss remained a mystery.
But why let the facts get in the way of a good story?
For where there is drama, there must be dramatists and compelling characters.
Instead, we heard the gruesome fact that this killing of another white farmer raised the figure of the farming murdered since liberty landed here to over 3000.
And so the words and lives of these two men - one a dead racist, the other expressing the views of a live one - filled up the bulk of the week's reading and column inches were filled in a bid to connect the two.
Of course the connection is a tenuous one, no office of statistics, no investigation in the thousands of killings of both black and white has discovered that a murder was committed because the killers were inspired by a politician's provocative song.
And anyone familiar with southern African revolutionary movements will find the same kind of songs in Zipra, Zanla, Frelimo, Swapo, and the MPLA.
Revolution, when it occurred against the twin evils of colonialism and apartheid during our lifetime, made men and women sing songs about their Kalashnikovs, about grenades, bombings and murder in a bid to boost morale against formidable enemies.
And as Africans, we do not have long to peer back into the past to see the significance of such songs to our collective history.
He never told us what he would do with it once it got into his hands, but would he have been elected had he added the refrain, "Shoot the boer"?
Mr Malema, it seems, belongs firmly to that group of post-struggle revolutionaries, whose credentials as veterans of the struggle are belied by their tender years and extreme lack of tact.
It was Kamuzu Banda, who, at the age of 68, ordered anyone 67 and younger in Malawi to join the youth league, or the Young Pioneers, as they were known.
And so Africa's Liberation movements have been filled by old men posturing as youths for decades, but Julius has no such excuse.
If anything, his hugely influential position in the governing party, twinned with his grassroots popularity has merely fashioned a demagogue in the making rather than a future leader.
As those wining and dining him massaged his ego, and chanted "Bull Malema!", a reference to his manhood and testosterone levels not to the aroma of his words, he returned to Johannesburg to pour scorn on Robert Mugabe's opposition and ruined months of diplomacy and government to government mediation.
As the grieving farmers in Ventersdorp prepared to bury their dubious champion amidst scenes of raw anger and hate, Mr Malema was kicking a journalist out of a press conference.
The events of the last week showed how fragile is the race truce which hangs over the "rainbow nation" and the internet has been awash with unsavoury points of view harking back to a time of hangings and cruel race hate; thoughts of guns and murder are threatening to derail a much anticipated World Cup and the president has had to blow his diplomatic kisses yet again to cool tempers and remind everyone of the demons that could be awoken when people lose their heads.
Which takes me back to that murder on Easter Saturday.
I for one would like to know all the facts pertaining to that evening.
Who were these young men?
What are their lives like?
But the trial has been postponed until next month and no reporter has been willing to tell the farm workers' story, preferring instead the ranting of a Sandton-based new revolutionary.
North Korea's state-run television has announced Kim Jong-il's re-election as chairman of the National Defence Commission at the Supreme People's Assembly.
It is the most important position in North Korea, putting him in overall control of the armed forces.
His re-election comes days after a rocket launch that was praised at home but criticised at the UN.
One person was killed and several others injured in the attacks during Friday Mass.
The interior ministry said the assaults had been carried out by one "deranged" man but earlier police reports talked of three simultaneous attacks.
Christians make up 10% of the Egyptian population and have complained of harassment and discrimination.
Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood endorsed the Christians' protest, calling the incident very sad news.
The interior ministry named the assailant as Mahmoud Salah-Eddin Abdel-Raziq, 25, and said he was "psychologically disturbed".
It said the man attacked two churches and was arrested as he tried to enter a third.
The ministry said five people had been injured, the police as many as 16.
About 600 Copts protested outside one of the churches attacked - Saints Church - holding banners with slogans such as "Until when?" and "Hosni Mubarak, where are you?" referring to the nation's president.
Some Copts argue that previous attacks on them have gone unpunished or have drawn light sentences.
Witnesses said the churches only had one guard each on Friday.
A doctor told AP that one policeman refused to fire on an attacker, saying he did not have orders.
Most Christians in Egypt are Copts - Christians descended from the ancient Egyptians.
Their church split from the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches in 451AD because of a theological dispute over the nature of Christ, but is now, on most issues, doctrinally similar to the Eastern Orthodox church.
He said in a speech to the left-wing think-tank Demos that Tories had won "the battle of ideas" and were not facing the challenges of the 1970s.
Tony Blair had known what people wanted in the 1990s, he said, and he saw his task as "preserving the fruits of the Thatcher revolution".
However, New Labour had failed to deliver on its promises, he said.
He blamed Chancellor Gordon Brown - widely seen as Mr Blair's likely successor - for increasing bureaucracy.
Mr Cameron said Conservatives should focus on a vibrant economy, decent society but also have "happiness, quality of life and environmental sustainability as central goals".
Mr Blair's triumph had been to focus on social justice and economic efficiency, but Labour had failed because it had introduced "legislation, regulation and bureaucracy".
"Wherever they have seen a problem, they have seen action by the state as the solution," he said, adding that it was the "natural instinct" of Mr Brown.
The issues Mr Blair focused on - a stronger economy and more decent society - were now the "common ground of British politics".
"The principal task for us is now clear," he said.
Mr Cameron argued that Labour's move towards what had traditionally been Tory ground had devastated the Conservatives.
This involved focusing too much on areas where the parties did still differ - tax, immigration and Europe - despite successive leaders recognising the need to avoid being seen to be extreme, he said.
However, former Conservative Party chairman Lord Tebbit warned against moving towards the "morass" of the political centre ground.

Renault's Giancarlo Fisichella is a hot favourite to win the first race of the Formula One season after securing pole position for the Australian Grand Prix with most of his main rivals a long way down the grid.
After the first of the two qualifying sessions was disrupted by rain, none of the pre-season favourites has joined the Italian in the top seven.
Renault and McLaren have looked the strongest teams both in pre-season testing and throughout the practice sessions in Australia.
But Juan Pablo Montoya is the closest to Fisichella and his McLaren is down in ninth place, just behind BAR's Jenson Button and ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello.
Fisichella's team-mate Fernando Alonso is 13th, with world champion Michael Schumacher 18th.
The Ferrari star decided not to set a time in Sunday morning's final session following a very slow lap on Saturday and has instead decided to change his engine.
This would normally incur a penalty of being put to the back of the grid, but Schumacher will not lose out because he was so far behind anyway.
He had previously scrapped gigs in Sheffield on Friday, Newcastle on Saturday and Tuesday's Wembley Arena leg after doctors advised him to rest.
Promoters are trying to reschedule the gigs for dates in December.
A spokesman for the singer-songwriter, 62, said he was "terribly disappointed" at not being able to perform.
Sir Elton and Billy Joel were forced to cancel US dates after Joel fell ill back in July.
Joel was told to rest after coming down with "flu-like symptoms" and "extreme fatigue".
Sir Elton and Joel had been touring together for two months under the banner Face 2 Face, selling out arenas across the US.
The Mujahideen, mostly foreign volunteers during the 1992-95 civil war, are being treated as squatters even though they fought alongside government forces.
The first two fighters are reported to have left the houses they had been occupying in the small village of Bocinja, near Maglaj in central Bosnia, before the properties were sealed by police.
Last week, people living around the village put up roadblocks when they heard incorrect reports that the evictions were about to begin.
When the barricades came down three days later, 19 people were arrested, including several described as foreigners or Mujahideen.
Local Mayor Mehmed Bradaric told the French news agency, AFP, on Monday that the evictions would continue at the rate of two a day.
The Mujahideen came from Iran, Afghanistan and other Islamic countries to fight alongside the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government army during the war.
They have settled in villages around the town of Maglaj, where they have been living illegally in Serb-owned houses.
Until now, the local authorities and the international community had tended to turn a blind eye, but now the Serbs, who were forced to flee during the war, want to reclaim their old homes.
The international crisis group which produces regular reports on Bosnia says the Mujahideen are a source of potential political and ethnic instability in central Bosnia.
Correspondents say that, by going ahead with the evictions, the government is putting the rights of property-owners ahead of the right to shelter, but it may prove to be the only way to deal with an otherwise insoluble problem.
The Skynet 5B platform will ride into orbit atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport, in French Guiana.
It will join the 5A satellite lofted successfully in March and which is already handling secure traffic for UK forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The investment includes replacing and updating control centres, and the major antennas and terminals used by military ships, land vehicles and planes to communicate through the satellites.
The 5B spacecraft is waiting on the launch pad in Kourou for a flight timed to start at 1904 local time (2204 GMT).
"We've had an incredibly smooth launch campaign so far, and now we're in the final stages," said Patrick Wood, who has led the development of both spacecraft for manufacturer EADS Astrium.
Skynet 5 will allow the Army, Royal Navy and RAF to pass much more data, faster between command centres.
The bandwidth capacity is two-and-a-half times that of the previous satellite constellation, Skynet 4.
Although they look much like any of the other modern commercial telecommunications spacecraft launched from Kourou, the 5s incorporate new technologies specially prepared for military use.
The spacecraft have also been "hardened" to withstand any interference - attempts to disable or take control of the satellites - and any efforts to eavesdrop on their sensitive communications.
They each have advanced receive antennas that enable the spacecraft to selectively listen to signals and filter out attempts to "jam" them.
They will also resist attempts to disrupt them with high-powered lasers.
"Hardened doesn't mean armour-plated, because the cost of launching a spacecraft like that would be phenomenal and the amount of useable payload in it would be very small," explained Mr Wood.
The benefits of the upgrade should become evident when the UK starts using Predator unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support troops in Afghanistan.
These aircraft will stream real-time video of Taleban activity and, with the capacity of Skynet 5, those pictures can be fed back to the UK quickly for further analysis, if necessary.
The abundance of information has to be managed, however.
Tony Skinner, from Jane's Defence Weekly, said British commanders had admitted they were still learning how best to handle what is becoming a flood of information.
"As some of these new systems are coming online, and the communication bearers increase capacity, the armed forces have to work out the human processes, standards and protocols needed to use the information efficiently," Mr Skinner explained.
The cost of the Skynet project has raised eyebrows, not least because it has been financed through a private company with City money.
Paradigm Secure Communications won a contract with the Ministry of Defence to supply satellite services to UK forces.
The contract called for two new spacecraft and, because of the way the financing deal was put together, will allow for an in-orbit spare, Skynet 5C to be launched next year.
The MoD is currently struggling to tie down the details of another major PFI (Private Finance Initiative) to overhaul the RAF's mid-air re-fuelling tankers, but Paradigm managing director, Malcolm Peto, is in no doubt the novel procurement route is good value.
"This is the way to do it," he said.
"Other European militaries and procurement agencies have been sceptical that we could put this satcom network and services together.
Friday's Ariane rocket will also loft a Brazilian telecommunications spacecraft.
Mr Lubbers, who is making his first official visit to the Afghanistan, was speaking in the western town of Islam Qila to which he drove from Iran.
He will go on to Herat before visiting Kabul, Kandahar and the opposition-held town of Faizabad.
Continuing fighting and a widespread drought have forced more than half a million people to leave their homes in the past eight months to search for help in other areas of Afghanistan - others have crossed into neighbouring Pakistan and Iran.
Mr Lubbers said he was not visiting Afghanistan in a political role, but a humanitarian one.
However, he said he would call on the ruling Taleban movement and their opponents in the Northern Alliance to stop fighting.
The Taleban control most of Afghanistan, but are battling to wrest control of an area in the north from the opposition.
During his four-day visit, Mr Lubbers will go to a vast camp for internally displaced people near Herat in western Afghanistan.
The UN says 1,500 desperate people arrive at the camp each day, and there is a shortage of tents, latrines and sanitation facilities.
While fighting continues sporadically, the main reason for people moving to Herat is the widespread drought.
Local residents say last year's drought was the worst in living memory - but this year's could be even worse.
The UN's regional co-ordinator for western Afghanistan, Hans Christian Poulsen, said many people realised there would be no wheat crop this year and had decided to leave.
Others have already eaten the seed meant for planting.
The UN and other agencies are trying to bring emergency food supplies to villages, especially in the northern provinces of Badghis and Ghor, to stop people leaving, but they are finding the numbers are overwhelming.
The UN is extremely short of funds for Afghanistan.
One official said the crisis had been building up slowly and many felt such situations were normal here.
It is thought half a million people are at risk in the areas around Herat.
Many of them are remaining in their remote villages because they simply cannot afford to travel anywhere else.
Nicola Fenton, 38, admitted assisting the management of the brothel at Illogan, near Camborne, in 2005.
Fenton, of Albion Road, Helston, now faces a confiscation hearing where police will try to claim back thousands of pounds.
Her case, at Exeter Crown Court, was adjourned for pre-sentence reports.
The Glaslyn Osprey Community Society (GOCS) claims the RSPB is using the site primarily to recruit members.
They also claim a promise to hand the site at Pont Croesor to the local community to run has been broken.
The RSPB said no promises had been broken and membership was encouraged, but the main reason for the site was to promote and protect the ospreys.
The project was set up in 2004 when the ospreys - the only breeding pair in Wales - first arrived.
It was initially paid for as part of an European Objective One-funded project called Aren't Birds Brilliant.
The birds have attracted thousands of visitors to the area since 2004, and have come back to the nest site again this year, returning from Africa about three weeks ago.
Gwen Williams, who has both worked and volunteered on the project, said the RSPB was changing the site and using staff to sell membership, rather than tell visitors about the birds.
"In the past there was someone on the site who was responsible for taking the details of anyone who wanted to join the RSPB, but now all the staff have to sell membership," she said.
Ms Williams said she had decided not to volunteer at the visitor centre as a result, although she will still volunteer to watch the nest site.
"I won't go anywhere near Pont Croesor, but I will still work to protect the nest to make sure no-one gets to the eggs - protecting the birds is the most important thing," she said.
John Parry Williams said he had put in between 900 and 1,000 hours of volunteering at both the nest and visitor centres.
"I've been involved since the start and my understanding was that the site would be handed back to the local community," he said.
"They also want to turn it into a membership-collecting factory and I feel very strongly about the whole situation," he added.
Mr Williams said he was cutting all contact with the project as a result.
Dr Stowe added that the RSPB had always worked with the community on the project, setting up a local forum, with an independent chair, and using large numbers of local and visiting volunteers.
"It has been a very successful partnership," he said.
"The purpose of showing people the only nesting pair of the iconic fish-catching osprey in Wales is to foster their enjoyment of Welsh wildlife and to support its safeguarding and conservation," he added.
"If visitors wish to support our work by joining, we think that's fantastic.
"As a charity, particularly in the current economic climate, we need as much support (volunteers and memberships) as we can get to help us show these birds to the people of north Wales," he said.

The ex-Formula 1 champion appeared to suffer a puncture before hitting the barriers after Mulsanne corner.
Mansell, part of a three-driver line-up alongside sons Leo and Greg, remained in his car for several minutes before being taken to a waiting ambulance.
Early reports from the track said he was helped out of his car by marshals but did not appear to be injured.
An update on the Le Mans official website later claimed that Mansell was "fine" after receiving "a bump on the head".
Mansell, who also won the 1993 IndyCar series in the United States, started from 18th on the grid in his Beechdean Motorsport Ginetta Zytek.
After five laps, in slippery conditions, his car clipped the rail between posts 89 and 95 - a fast stretch known as Indianapolis.
The world famous endurance race was held up for 31 minutes behind the safety car before getting underway again.
It was the first time a team of drivers featuring a father and two sons has competed at Le Mans.
Mansell retired from F1 after two races during the 1995 season but returned to the cockpit in the Grand Prix Masters Series for veteran F1 drivers in 2005 and 2006.
Until now turbans have been searched or removed only to resolve an unexplained alarm from an airport metal detector.
But now security will have greater discretion to inspect turbans so that they can be manually checked for objects such as non-metallic weapons.
However Sikh groups have responded to the new measures by describing them as outrageous and discriminatory.
Sikh men wear turbans to cover their hair, which they leave uncut in accordance with their religion.
Organisations representing Sikhs have only recently completed a publicity campaign to explain the significance of the kirpan, or religious sword, to security officials.
The Transportation Security Administration insisted the new policy was necessary to counter the threat of improvised bombs and chemical weapons.
In Britain, the government said recently that private searches of turbans might be necessary as part of airport security.
Taiwan's military exercise, the aim of which was to simulate an invasion by mainland China, can only add to the tension between the two old adversaries.
There is no doubting the seriousness of the exercise - and the message it is meant to send out to the authorities in mainland China.
Thousands of personnel awere involved and live ammunition was employed.
What is more, the exercise went ahead despite the row between the Americans and Chinese, who have so far steadfastly refused to return the US spy plane that was forced to land on a Chinese military airfield after a mid-air collision with a Chinese jet.
Richard Boucher of the US State Department simply said the aircraft should be returned.
"We think it's quite clear that it should be returned," he said "We're looking for our airplane back and we've proposed to them how to do it.
But seen from Taiwan, there is no reticence in publicly pointing to the underlying problems in the China-Taiwan-US relationship - and how they can be resolved.
On the surface, there seem to be all the elements for a worrying escalation of tension in the triangular US-China-Taiwan relationship.
But Professor John Copper, an adviser to the Reagan administration and a long-standing expert on US-China relations, believed the Taiwanese military exercises were "quite routine".
"They do come at a rather sensitive time, in view of the surveillance plane that was landed in China and also the talks that are going on between US and Chinese representatives at the moment," he said.
"I think they want to negotiate the return of the plane and perhaps get something from the United States - perhaps a reduction in the [surveillance] flights that will be done.
The Microsoft co-founder had topped the Forbes business magazine's rich-list for the past 13 years.
Mr Buffett's wealth increased by $10bn (�5bn) last year to $62bn.
Mr Gates's fortune climbed by $2bn during the same period, dragging him down to third on the list with a fortune of $58bn.
He was narrowly pipped into second place by the Mexican communications magnate Carlos Slim Helu, whose $60bn net worth has doubled in the past two years, Forbes reports.
"The reason for this explosion in wealth is that we're in the midst of a phenomenal global boom," said Steve Forbes, chief executive of Forbes magazine.
Two-thirds of those on the list are classified as self-made billionaires, and 50 of them are under the age of 40.
Mark Zuckerberg, 23, the founder of the social networking site Facebook, joins the list as the world's youngest billionaire.
Nicknamed the "sage of Omaha" because of his phenomenal investment success, Mr Buffett, 77, has stakes in a range of companies, including Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Tesco.
Forbes says he filed his first tax return at the age of 13, claiming a $35 tax deduction for his bicycle.
After studying economics at New York's Columbia Business School under investment guru Benjamin Graham, he began purchasing shares in textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in 1962 before buying a controlling stake in 1965.
The company's stock price surged to a record $150,000 a share in December, just before Forbes formulated its 2008 ultra-rich list.
Two years ago, Mr Buffett pledged most of his Berkshire shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Backstage at The One Show, the former prime minister's daughter referred to a tennis player as a "golliwog".
A spokesman for the 55-year-old, who has contributed to the show for three years, said the comment had been "an off-the-cuff remark made in jest".
The BBC said the matter was being discussed "as a matter of urgency".
Thatcher's spokesman told The Times she made the remark in a conversation with the show's presenter Adrian Chiles in the green room and it was "meant as a joke".
"Carol never intended any racist comment," he said.
"She made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up.
"It is disgusting that we've had a leak of private conversations in the green room - the BBC has more leaks than Thames Water.
According to press reports, the comment was made during a conversation about the Australian Open tennis tournament, in reference to a player who had recently been knocked out of the men's singles draw.
Before meeting Claudia, all I knew was that she was a mother of two from South America who had been extremely sick because of damage to her left trachea caused by tuberculosis.
I was expecting to meet a fairly world-worn woman in her fifties.
So to see a very young looking and glamorous 30-year-old surrounded by the Spanish snappers as she walked into the media conference was more like some pre-arranged celebrity/model opportunity.
Claudia met me after the conference with her surgeon Paolo Macchiarini and agreed to be interviewed on a local park bench.
She told me, through a translator, about her 15-year-old son and four-and-a-half-year-old daughter back in Colombia, and how they were looking forward to seeing her.
"My son did experience the process of me being sick, being in hospital," she said.
"But he is happy now that everything went well.
"He expected to see me completely better.
I asked just how ill she had been.
"I could not walk or play with my children.
"When I could not breathe I could not have a long conversation.
"I had to stop all the time to breathe.
"I had to tell them 'now, please don't talk' because I needed to breathe, and that was very difficult for me to keep up the relationship.
"He told me that it was a trial that had never been carried out before and that this would be the first in the world.
Claudia was keen to pass on her thanks, not just to her surgeon, but to the whole pan-European medical team that made her case such a success.
"I was a sick woman, now I will be able to live a normal life.
"I am very happy they could do this to me, they had been studying for so long and it worked out well.
I asked Dr Macchiarini if he was planning any more operations.
He said there was a German patient in the hospital who he was hoping to give a transplant to.
"Would it be possible to see her?' I asked.
In his ever-helpful way the surgeon said he would enquire.
Shortly after this I disinfected my hands before entering the hospital room where the patient, Rosa De Magria, was lying on her side, and clearly very sick.
The 44-year-old from Dortmund told me she had cancer of the trachea and that she was waiting for a donor organ to be identified.
"I have been very ill since February and need to have oxygen all the time," she said.
I felt it best to leave then as she was clearly very ill and struggling to speak.
It raises the question of how society will be able to afford to introduce this as routine.
That said, the stem cell technique avoids the significant costs of keeping patients on anti-rejection medication.
This could be one of the most significant medical developments so far this century.
They have sewn the Turkish national flag to the top - a mark of solidarity for those suffering in Gaza.
It's just a fraction of the fury here at Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
Across the country, there have been regular demonstrations - some tens of thousands strong.
Outside the Israeli consulate, there is a noisy round-the-clock protest where demonstrators burn Israeli flags and throw eggs.
Most outspoken though has been Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan himself.
It is difficult rhetoric for Israel to swallow from an ally.
But Israel's offensive in Gaza has caused outrage.
"There is a great deal of disappointment that there has not been one word of sympathy from Turkey about the Israelis," a senior Israeli diplomat told the BBC.
In power since 2002, Mr Erdogan's party has worked to boost Turkey's role in the Middle East.
"I am sure the AKP's own religious background plays a role here, but its policy is that you have to reach out to everyone," says Soli Ozel, international relations specialist at Bilgi University.
"We will contribute to a monitoring force," foreign ministry spokesman Burak Ozugergin confirms.
Angry themselves at Turkey's attitude, Israelis have reportedly cancelled business and tourist trips here.
But both sides agree their relationship will survive in the long run, when Turkey has ambitions of helping to reconcile the competing Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah.
Despite the prime minister's passionate denunciation of Israeli aggression in Gaza, Turkey has notably avoided any sanctions on Israel, economic or diplomatic.
The two have been pushing different formats which has so far split movie studios and technology firms.
Toshiba, with NEC and Sanyo, is promoting the HD-DVD format, while Sony's Blu-ray technology is backed by a group including Dell and Samsung.
This offers incredible 3D-like quality pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit.
But the technology and movie industries recognise that a format war, like the VHS-Beta battle in the 1980s which saw the death of the Beta video cassette, is undesirable.
"The two groups are in talks to jointly develop a new standard for next-generation DVDs to give the best benefit to consumers," a Sony source told the Reuters news agency.
Toshiba said a single "hybrid" format would be better for people and it said it would aim for that as a compromise.
Sony is reportedly pushing Blu-ray's disc structure and HD-DVD software technology as a hybrid solution.
Toshiba wants to use HD-DVD's disc structure, which is closer to that of DVDs now, and use Sony's multi-layer data recording technology.
Blu-ray discs can store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshiba's HD-DVD can hold 30GB.
Both disc formats offer much better quality audio and video, and could also mean there is a lot more room for interactive elements.
Movie studios and technology companies have been choosing which format to back, but many have been leaving their options open for alternative formats.
Blu-ray backers include Apple, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Samsung, and Disney.
HD-DVD supporters include Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and Warner Brothers Studios.
Toshiba and Sony have been in talks with studios and technology companies to come up with a compromise, that would mean discs work on all types of players.

Now scientists think they know why the monkeys "urine wash" in this way.
A new study shows that the brains of female tufted capuchins become more active when they smell the urine of sexually mature adult males.
That suggests males wash with their urine to signal their availability and attractiveness to females.
Details of the finding are published in the American Journal of Primatology.
A number of New World monkey species, including mantled howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys and the few species of capuchins, regularly "urine wash", urinating into the palm of the hand, then vigorously rubbing the urine into the feet and hindquarters.
Several hypotheses have been put forward as to why they do it, including that it may somehow help maintain body temperature or allow other monkeys to better identify an individual by smell.
Most studies into the behaviour have been inconclusive.
"But one study reported that when being solicited by a female, adult males increased their rate of urine-washing," said Dr Kimberley Phillips, a primatologist at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, US.
"Since female capuchins [when they are most fertile] actively solicit males, we reasoned that urine washing by males might provide chemical information to the females about their sexual or social status," she told BBC News.
To investigate, Dr Phillips and her colleagues scanned the female monkeys' brains while the animals sniffed adult male and juvenile male urine.
These magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed that female tufted monkeys' brains became significantly more active when they sniffed the scent of urine produced by adult males compared to that from juveniles.
Since adult males are sexually mature, they excrete higher concentrations of the male sex hormone testosterone in their urine.
The concentration of this testosterone is also linked to their social status; higher status males tend to produce more.
"Female capuchin monkey brains react differently to the urine of adult males than to urine of juvenile males," said Dr Phillips.
She added that it was surprising that capuchin monkeys appeared to respond to these cues, because the species is not known for using communication based on smell.

His father won a war and lost an election on the strength of the recession that followed the Gulf conflict a decade ago - Mr Bush sees the danger of repeating the mistake.
The centre-piece of the policy the president outlined in Chicago is the removal of taxation on the dividends shareholders receive.
His hope is that this benefit to stockholders will raise stock prices and so restore confidence in the whole economy.
Whatever their merits, economists are sceptical that Mr Bush's measures will transform the economic climate overnight.
Firstly, the proposals do favour the better-off, and the better-off are not the people most likely to increase their spending when windfalls come their way.
Secondly, other factors are dominant at the moment, namely the fall in investment by companies as they try to realign after the glut of the 1990s.
On top of that, the prospect of war and its effect on oil prices and consumer confidence is an inescapable backdrop.
Not that consumers are lacking much confidence despite all the gloomy talk.
Spending is still rising at more than 4% a year whatever the pessimism of pundits appears to be about the future.
Whatever the economics of the current situation, we do now have some political clarity.
The lines for the 2004 presidential election are drawn.
Democrats favour some tax cuts, targeted at the poor but not at the expense of public spending on social programmes like education and health.
Mr Bush will go to the poll promising "to give the people back their own money", as he puts it.
It's the age old right-left argument, which voters see in different ways at different times, depending on how secure they feel and how much they feel they need the safety net of the state.
The Perth business enjoyed a healthy rise in revenues from its UK bus operations while passenger numbers rose at its South West Trains franchise.
Stagecoach said it was also encouraged by trading at its US business which has been beset by problems in recent years.
South West Trains - the largest of Stagecoach's two wholly owned franchises - enjoyed a 8% rise in turnover and 4% growth in passenger numbers.
"Strong underlying profit growth has been achieved across our businesses despite the significant increases in fuel prices affecting public transport operators," said chief executive Brian Souter.
All activity is centred on the arrival of the 76th Academy Awards as streets are closed down, pavements are scrubbed and the red carpet already placed in position.
But far from there being scores of surly, beefy security personnel the men and women guards have a smile for the fascinated tourists despite having to don yellow macs to keep off the intermittent rain.
Whether the stars will follow their fashion lead if the rains return on Sunday remains to be seen, but the umbrella carriers better get practicing their own walk down the red carpet, to ensure not a drop falls on designer dresses and perfectly coiffed hair.
The final touches are being made to the surroundings of the home of the Oscars, the Kodak Theatre, transforming it from shopping mall to award ceremony splendour.
Those taking their seats will have had an extraordinarily long wait, having won their tickets for last year's ceremony in a lottery, only for the bleachers to be cancelled as the Academy scaled back the proceedings as a mark of respect for the war.
They will finally get their chance to take part in the Oscars but the anticipation will be even further heightened by the fact they will be shown to their seats at 0600 while the guests do not start arriving until 1500 at the earliest.
The stars themselves do not set foot in Hollywood until the big day, but the area is already heaving with news crews from around the world, as they experiment with angles and shots trying to second guess what could happen and where on the night.
On average 62m Americans watch the live telecast, which this year will have a five-second delay in case of any Janet Jackson Super Bowl-type mishaps occur.
As well as providing one of the world's biggest television events of the year, the Academy Awards also benefit the local economy.
Hollywood's honorary mayor and local celebrity, Johnny Grant, predicts the community as a whole profits to the tune of $61m when the Oscars roadshow is in town, from everybody from limousine drivers to the pizza delivery boys as every hotel in the area is packed out.
Grant has enjoyed a varied career in movies, from acting to producing, and at the age of 80 he has lost none of his zeal for Hollywood and he does all he can to promote it.
But despite a guaranteed invite he chooses not to attend the awards any more.
"If it was up to me I'd do away with the ceremony and just have a three-hour red carpet show," he joked to BBC News Online.
In his capacity as an ambassador for Hollywood, the larger-than-life Grant conducts all the Walk of Fame ceremonies meeting the stars up close and personal.
But he is not phased by their celebrity status, saying only in the days of Ann Sheridan and Marilyn Monroe did he get excited, "as every red-bloodied male would".
But while Grant is blase about the awards, for some it is still a thrilling event.
Pop artist Burton Morris will be attending for the first time, but it will be his work that will be taking centre stage.
The celebrated artist can count the cast of Friends among his admirers, as his work regularly features in the show's Central Perk cafe.
Morris' wife Julie is so proud of her husband that she will be wearing a specially designed dress which incorporates the Oscar poster's motif.
The 2003 awards were dominated by the war in Iraq, while the previous year the attention focussed on the 11 September tragedies.
This year the movie industry can once again get back to putting on a full-blown celebration, with the movies and the actors once more at the top of the bill.
Polls suggested the governing Justice and Development Party (AK) took around 43% of the vote - in its first major test since coming to power in 2002.
Mr Erdogan said the result strengthened his government and gave impetus to his policies at home and abroad.
He wants to push ahead with reforms aimed at reviving the Turkish economy and speed up its bid to join the EU.
He says he also wants to push for a resolution over the divided island of Cyprus.
With almost half the votes counted, Mr Erdogan's pro-western, Islamic-rooted party appeared to have taken the post of mayor in 55 of 81 cities - including in Istanbul and Ankara.
The main opposition, centre-left People's Republican Party, took around 15% of the vote, with the right-wing Nationalist Action and True Path parties winning around 10%.
Turkey's main pro-Kurdish movement, the Democratic People's Party, and its left-wing allies retained control of five major cities in the predominantly Kurdish southeast.
They included the region's biggest city, Diyarbakir.
But the party also lost some ground gained in the last local elections, losing a number of cities to the governing party.
"Turkey once again voted for stability and development," Mr Erdogan told a press conference.
Analysts say the poll seems to confirm the popularity of the party in a traditionally secular country.
AK is largely credited with bringing political and economic stability to Turkey, with the inflation rate at its lowest level in 25 years.
It has also been widely praised for keeping the country out of the Iraq war.
Initial fears that its leaders might turn to more radical, Islamic policies once in power also proved unfounded, with the government keeping its eyes firmly on a pro-EU agenda.
Analysts say the victory in Sunday's elections will now strengthen the government's hand in pushing for a settlement on the divided island of Cyprus.
After voting on Sunday, Mr Erdogan said he would call US President George W Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and French President Jacques Chirac over the coming days to discuss Cyprus.
"I am going to ask for support so that the negotiations continue more positively," he said.
The UN-led peace process has entered a new phase, with Mr Erdogan due to join negotiations with Greek and Cypriot leaders in Switzerland on Monday.
Mr Erdogan has been urging the Turkish Cypriots to reach a settlement.
Unresolved issues in negotiations over the UN blueprint centre on property claims and territorial concessions.
Deputies also called on the head of the judiciary to reopen pro-reform newspapers closed in a hardline crackdown in April.
The press law, passed on 18 April
Even before the restrictive press legislation was passed, the judiciary had suspended more than a dozen dailies and jailed a number of press chiefs for various offences relating to the content of their publications.
Reformists, who won a huge majority in the February elections, had pledged to overturn the restrictive law in the first weeks of the new parliament, which opened late last month.
"The closure of 18 publications with a circulation of more than one million copies per day can only be likened to closing society's schools," said Ahmad Bourqani, an MP from Tehran.
Shahi Arablou, a member of the conservative minority in the new parliament, said he was against any hasty revision of the press law.
"Some changes to the law could possibly be argued for, but changes must not be made right now, proposals for change should be open to deeper study," Mr Arablou said.
The closures came after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the independent press "bases of the enemy" in a public speech.
El Salvadorean President Francisco Flores was the only Latin American head of state invited to participate in a G8 meeting on the fight against poverty.
President Flores said they also pledged to increase trade with developing nations, in order to create more jobs.
"A well-paid job is what can get a person out of poverty," he added.
In Honduras, a state of emergency has been declared after most of this year's harvest was lost because of a severe drought.
But Andrew MacMillan - an expert at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation - says that a purposeful new approach to hunger eradication must be the first step in eliminating poverty.
"People who are hungry cannot study or work very well," he said.
Earlier this month the Mexican president, Vicente Fox, outlined his administration's plans to combat widespread poverty.
In Brazil, a report published by the independent Social Policy Centre argues that current government policies do not adequately address the fight against poverty.
He based this figure on those living on a monthly income of less than 80 reals (about $32), the amount needed to ensure the minimum food intake recommended by the World Health Organisation.
In contrast, the government claims there are only 20 million poverty-stricken Brazilians.
The Centre claims that uneven income distribution - leading to greater social inequality - is the key to the problem.
Economists calculated that if every Brazilian above the poverty level contributed 10 reals (about $4) a month, hunger could be eradicated altogether.
Mr Blair has not disclosed how much time off he will be taking, although he has said he will try to adapt his work schedule to the new arrival's demands.
Until last year, fathers in Britain were not entitled to any statutory paternity leave.
As a result of Britain having to fall into line with laws applied across the European Union, however, British fathers may now take, as a right, up to 13 weeks unpaid leave within the first five years of their child's life.
Mothers in Britain are entitled to 18 weeks paid maternity leave around the birth of their baby, and they are also entitled to the 13 weeks unpaid leave now available to fathers across the EU.
Jim Parton, of the pressure group Families Need Fathers, says paternity leave is an entirely welcome and long overdue advance.
"I know a lot of employers who complained that it's yet another cost.
Compared with many developed countries, British paternity leave is not very generous.
Sweden is the most generous, allowing up to 450 days parental leave to be allocated between both parents and with up to 85% of their income to be paid for the first year.
Japan gives one year's parental leave, also transferable between parents and with an allowance of 25% of earnings.
France allows up to 26 weeks 100% paid maternity leave and three years parental leave, although not paid.
Britain allows 13 weeks unpaid parental leave and is more generous than the US, Australia and New Zealand - none of them allow for any paid leave.
Russia and the Czech Republic both allow more paid leave for mothers than does Britain.
Yvonne Roberts, who helps run a pressure group for families, says it is vital that parents are given enough time with their new offspring before returning to work.
The 19th Century document belonged to Midshipman Henry Binstead who kept a record of his time in the Royal Navy off west Africa in 1823-1824.
His great great granddaughter Rosa Lee, from Maidenhead, Berks, gave the diary to the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth.
The diary is part of an exhibition marking the bicentenary of the abolition of transAtlantic slavery.
An act of Parliament banning the transportation and capture of slaves came into force in March 1807.
Henry Binstead's accounts spanned his time aboard the HMS Owen Glendower part of the navy's West Africa Squadron, which patrolled the African coast to stop the illegal slave trade.
Midshipman Binstead, originally from Portsmouth, kept account of the human suffering he witnessed when an illegal slave ship was intercepted.
"I never witnessed a more horrid description than my messmates gave me of the wretched state they were in [320 men, women and children] onboard actually dying 10-12 a day owing to the confinement below.
Sir Paul hopes promoters of the show in Liverpool on 1 June will agree to open the door to 5,000 more fans.
His call comes after thousands were left disappointed when city council staff got tickets a day before they went on public sale.
An inquiry has been called for after 4,000 out of 5,000 tickets, earmarked for a Liverpool City Council booking hotline, were reserved by staff before the line opened.
The concert at the city's Kings Dock will be the ex-Beatle's 90th and final show of his world tour.
Sir Paul's publicist Jeff Baker said on Thursday said the star "was ecstatic his home town concert sold out so fast".
"If the gate was to be increased it would be good for those fans who've been unable to get tickets," Mr Baker told BBC Radio Merseyside.
City council leader Mike Storey has voiced his anger over how the authority's staff were able to reserve the tickets 24-hours before they went on general sale.
Mr Storey apologised to fans and described the way the tickets were handed out as "a lack of judgement".
Councillor Richard Kemp, a member of the ruling Liberal Democrat group, has also said he was "appalled" and has called for a full inquiry.
The proposal for increasing the crowd capacity was being discussed on Thursday by the council and London-based promoters Marshall Arts.
Experts at Leeds University discovered the secret to the ideal sandwich lay in how crispy and crunchy rashers were.
They found that two or three back bacon rashers should be cooked under a preheated oven grill for seven minutes at about 240C (475F).
The bacon should then be placed between two slices of farmhouse bread, 1cm to 2cm thick.
Four researchers at the Department of Food Science spent more than 1,000 hours testing 700 variations on the traditional bacon sandwich.
They tried different types and cuts of bacon, cooking techniques, types of oil and a range of cooking times at different temperatures.
A shortlist was then tested with computers to measure the texture of each sandwich.
Fifty volunteers also judged each sandwich according to its taste, texture and flavour.
"But our research proves that texture and the crunching sound is just - if not more - important.
Ieuan Wyn Jones on why Wales is losing out financially
At its autumn conference in Llandudno, he urged members to stress that the party is for everyone wherever they live in Wales, whatever their language.
It is understood research for Plaid has shown a significant proportion of voters believe it is extreme and irrelevant in UK-wide elections.
Mr Jones insisted the party's "only loyalty is to the people of Wales".
With a general election certain within nine months, it is Plaid Cymru's last major conference before polling day and much of the event and a party political broadcast are seeking to challenge the negative image many voters are thought to have of Plaid.
Party strategists have long been aware of the dangers of it being seen as simply a party for Welsh speakers or rural areas, more interested in independence than the more immediate concerns of ordinary voters.
But it would seem such impressions are firmly embedded in the minds of many of the voters it needs to attract if it is to achieve the sort of general election breakthrough which has eluded it so far.
Since devolution, Plaid Cymru AMs have won in traditional Labour areas such as Rhondda and Llanelli, but in Westminster terms it remains a small party representing rural, Welsh-speaking areas, contrasting with the broader support base its Scottish counterpart the SNP has achieved.
Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales the party was trying to understand whether there were "reasons why certain people feel they can't vote for Plaid at the moment".
"But it's a different political context now, completely different, because people don't see Plaid simply as a vehicle for protest votes any more.
Mr Jones told the conference that the party needed to tell people it was for everyone in Wales regardless of the language they speak, where they are from or where they live.
In a speech lasting around 35 minutes, Mr Jones called for a " new politics" insisting that only Plaid offered "real change".
Mr Jones also announced the party was launching its "biggest ever consultation" through the general election and up to the 2011 assembly poll "to ask everyone how Welsh government can help them and to ask you all to join us in that task".
"Now is not the time for a false choice between two parties who have miserably failed Wales over the past two decades," he argued.
"At a time when people in Wales feel angry and let down by the same old Westminster politics now is the time for change," Mr Jones said.
He asserted that Labour had "had it" and was "unrecognisable" to communities who "loyally supported it for almost a century".
But the Plaid leader said the change offered by the Conservatives at the general election amounts to cuts and threats to jobs and services, while protecting the "rich and powerful".
The party has three MPs, in Caernarfon, Carmarthen East and Dinefwr and Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.
It hopes to more than double that by winning Anglesey, Aberconwy, Ceredigion and Llanelli.
Such general election success would clearly represent a major breakthrough for Plaid, but would also put it in a stronger position to challenge Labour in the 2011 assembly election.
Delegates are also considering how the party should respond to a Conservative general election victory and what it should seek to extract from David Cameron in return for Plaid's support in the event of a hung parliament.
Changes to the way Wales receives funding from the Treasury and certainty over the issue of holding a referendum on further assembly powers are understood to be the prizes Plaid would want.
The Robins went into the game with just one league win to their name, but a first-half half-volley from Danny Haynes saw them past Reading.
Former England goalkeeper David James played a large part, frustrating the visitors from Berkshire all night.
The highlight was a superb second-half stop to deny Royals forward Noel Hunt, starting for the first time in a year.
Having lost just one of five away league games before this match, Reading were looking to move into the play-off places with a win.
They started confidently, with Shane Long showing good pace early on but City almost went ahead against the run of play when Albert Adomah's solo run and cross found Jon Stead, but his powerful strike came back off the underside of the bar.
Both sides were competing fiercely, but the hosts edged ahead in the 28th minute when a ball to the far post was headed back across goal by Adomah.
Stead saw his ambitious overhead kick blocked by Matt Mills, but the ball fell kindly for Haynes to hammer home his first goal of the season.
James was then called upon in the second half and showed the class that made him England's number one, tipping the ball to safety from Hunt's header after the Royals had strung together a series of passes for Andy Griffin to cross.

The superclubs are taking their shows around the world, British DJs will send thousands crazy in Ibiza and Ayia Napa while Britney and Mariah are said to be signing up UK garage producers.
Liverpool superclub Cream is at the forefront of the worldwide push, starting up a series of international dance festivals that they hope will turn their company into a globally recognised music brand.
Founder and managing director James Barton says he wants to establish up to 12 annual international festivals - and make Cream the clubbing equivalent of football giant Manchester United.
"There's a genuine feeling among a lot of young people around the world that the UK club scene is the original, the birthplace, where it's been successful," he told BBC News Online.
As well as the Creamfields events in Liverpool and Dublin, a show in New York will be headlined by Fatboy Slim and Orbital, while the festival will also travel to Las Vegas, Buenos Aries and Australia this year.
And Barton prefers taking Creamfields abroad to setting up nightclubs overseas because festivals are the best way to make money from spin-off CDs and radio and TV broadcasts.
"Creamfields enables us to put on show the whiff, musically, of what Cream stands for," he says.
London superclub Ministry of Sound is also spreading itself around the world - taking shows to South Africa and India as well as having residencies in Ibiza, Ayia Napa, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona this summer.
"The British dance scene has always been big overseas since people like Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold went off to Ibiza in the mid-80s and discovered ecstasy," according to Simon Hawkins of respected Brighton dance label Tru Thoughts.
British DJs are the best at taking influences, especially from America, and turning them into something new - like the big beat, two-step, and nu breaks scenes, he says.
But he stresses that DJs from other countries like France and Germany are catching up quickly.
Hawkins says the presence of big-name brands like Cream and Ministry, with their marketing budgets, makes it appear that we have more influence than we have.
"We're actually not dominating Europe any more than we were - it's just that these clubs are higher-profile and more marketable than the individual DJs who went before.
In America, boundaries between musical styles are more rigid, he says.
Stacy Osbaum, American music journalist and former editor of US dance culture magazine URB, says British dance music is popular but unlikely to break into the charts.
London house music label Hooj recently started targeting the world market, and now gets 75% of its business and website hits from the United States.
But the American market is in danger of being swamped by British DJs, he thinks.
Artists like Fatboy Slim and Paul Oakenfold have already made an impression.
Oakenfold, who has produced U2 and New Order, has been touring America with his Perfecto label for two years in an attempt to break into the market in his own right.
And Fatboy Slim, who had UK hits with Gangster Tripping and Right Here Right Now, was awarded single of the year for Rockafeller Skank by USA Today while Praise You was used by Al Gore during his presidential campaign.
And while he may not be a household name, 30,000 people will see him headline Creamfields New York at the start of September.
The bean counters at the major studios are salivating over the year's record breaking box office but the majority of critics and a large swathe of the film-making community have been far from satisfied with Hollywood in 2001.
Many of the big budget films resembled dull unoriginal market-tested products that short-changed the audience and failed to live up to the hype.
It was a well-written animation that reached a mass audience by offering intelligent, witty and mildly subversive entertainment that appealed to adults and children alike.
This year also saw an increasing blitzkrieg at the box office of "front-loading" new releases.
This has meant opening each new big budget picture as widely as possible to capitalise on its first weekend of business.
Picture after picture would open with impressive revenues only to find that the box office had taken a nosedive in the second week.
For the audience it meant one heavily promoted juggernaut after another demanding instant consumption, before it was rapidly discarded in favour of the next incoming potential blockbuster.
It was a brutal marketplace exceedingly hostile to films that required nurturing and time to build a following.
The whole world began to participate in this frenzy with an international release schedule in 2001 operating much more in lock-step with US domestic openings.
This was partly the result of the spread of the internet, which created a more homogenised world market for Hollywood films.
But the studios also moved more towards uniform international release dates to reduce the window of opportunity for film piracy.
The humans who perished, as well as those who survived the US's day of infamy, were given short shrift by this crass big budget entertainment that played out like an adolescent melodrama.
The year 2001, of course, had its own day of infamy on 11 September when the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon traumatised the nation and left every US institution, including Hollywood, in a state of shock.
Film industry executives huddled with the Bush administration to discuss ways it could contribute to the war effort, raising concern in some quarters that Washington was trying to control content.
But the full impact of the attacks may well be felt at some later point as new screenplays work their way through the pipeline.
In a year when mediocre storytelling was all-pervasive 2001 yielded too many films that were only saved by strong performances, but at least we had those to cherish.
Broadbent is one of the most adept and underrated actors working in the movies today and deserves to win an Oscar nomination, as do Russell Crowe and Will Smith.
With the Golden Globe nominations now out and the various critics groups making their end of the year picks, the broad contours of the Oscars race are beginning to emerge.
The films most likely to be in contention include A Beautiful Mind, Ali, Lord of The Rings, and Moulin Rouge.
Todd Field's first-time feature In The Bedroom, Robert Altman's ensemble murder mystery Gosford Park and Ridley Scott's powerful Black Hawk Down could also net nominations.
This year, Hollywood would really like an American feelgood epic that it could rally Oscar voters around.
But no such picture exists, and with no trophy-snagging juggernaut like Titanic or modern classic along the lines of American Beauty in sight, predicting the Oscars at this stage of the game remains a rather risky business.
Comare, a committee set up to advise ministers on the effect of radiation exposure, studied 32,000 cases of childhood cancer from 1969 to 1993.
It suggested the finding could be related to an immune system response to infections which was more likely in less densely populated areas.
But it said cases of lymphomas showed the opposite trend.
For many of the other childhood cancers, including tumours of the nervous system and soft-tissue sarcomas, there was no demographic trend.
About one in 500 children develop some form of cancer before the age of 15.
The study, the largest of its type ever carried out, also found that all childhood cancers do not occur evenly across Britain.
The researchers said the variations were greater than could be explained by pure chance and had to be caused by some other factors.
Comare chairman Professor Alex Elliott said the report raised a "whole host of questions" that required further research.
"It is not clear why childhood cancers tend to cluster like this.
"Much attention has been given to interactions between exposure to infections and immune responses.
But researchers said no general pattern of increased cancer incidence was seen around nuclear plants with the exception of Sellafield in Cumbria and Dounreay in Scotland - both of which were already known about.
When the clustering of childhood cancer was looked at among social demographic groupings, the highest rates were seen in the two most affluent groups.
A similar, albeit slightly weaker, pattern also emerged for bone tumours.
The report said there was no clear reason for the findings, but said one theory was that an immune response to infections could act as one of the triggers for leukaemia and this was more likely in richer areas.
It said more affluent parts of the country tended to be the least densely populated and this meant that in the first years of life children did not mix with other children as much as their counterparts in more deprived areas.
It added, as a result, the immune system developed less - the so-called "dirty hypothesis".
However, the report said it was also possible that the higher rates could be attributed to better diagnosis.
But the Health Protection Agency said there was no current consensus for the clustering.
"It may lend weight to the hypothesis that common infections may have a role in initiating or promoting the growth of cancer cells, assuming cancer is a multi-stage process.
Asteroid 2003 QQ47 will be elsewhere in the Solar System, moving on an orbit that will be watched by astronomers just in case it becomes worrisome again, but that is highly unlikely.
And since new objects were often given an initial classification of T1, in the absence of information, it would certainly be reduced to T0, "no significance", as more data came in, they explained.
The headlines about Doomsday were predictable; the date of 21 March 2014 became stuck in people's minds, some astronomers moaned about an "own goal", and the media declined to mention the all-clear when it came a day later.
If you think you have heard this type of thing before you are right.
So, astronomers revised their rules for releasing information to the public.
The new millennium brought 2000 SG344, a very small object, which might even be a spent rocket upper stage.
The rules were changed, again.
Roll on 2002 and 2002 MN, a small asteroid that whizzed by at about a third of the Earth-Moon distance - quite close really.
Because this happened without astronomers realising it until after the event, some in the media suggested they had egg on their faces in not providing any warning.
The scientists replied, slightly off the point, that it did not matter as2002 MN did not pose any danger anyway.
And then there was 2002 NT7.
I have regard for 2002 NT7, as far as one can for a rock that could threaten the Earth, as I broke the story and it won me an award.
But now a Canadian car maker is taking the concept of environmentally friendly cars one stage further.
Based in Toronto, the Zenn Motor Company has started to produce the Zenn, or Zero Emission No Noise car.
The $12,500 (�6,250) car runs entirely on electric power and unlike the Prius uses no petrol whatsoever.
"You get an extension cord that comes with the car and you plug it into any household outlet," explains Tom Bevilacque, owner of Amenia Motors in upstate New York, which sells the Zenn.
That charge will get you about 50-65 km (30-40 miles) and costs about 50 cents (25p).
But marketing to the tree-hugger demographic is limited, something the makers of the Zenn know.
But this is changing, he says.
The Zenn is the first low-speed electric vehicle that looks like a car instead of a futuristic golf cart and as a result appeals to a wider demographic, including those in their 30s and 40s.
But, Mr Clifford readily admits that in its present configuration, it will not meet everyone's needs.
The company now has plans to build an all-electric car capable of reaching highway speeds, something that MIT engineering professor Donald Sadoway says he is ready for.
"I would dearly love to own that car, not because it's green, and not because there are all those wonderful things that should accrue from a zero emission vehicle.
"Batteries are expensive, batteries are bulky, batteries are heavy, and batteries don't hold very much energy," says Professor Dan Sperling of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Davis.
The Zenn is powered by lead acid batteries that do not hold much charge.
Lithium ion and nickel metal hydride batteries hold a greater amount and provide a greater driving range, but the nickel batteries are costly and lithium ion batteries still have safety problems related to their flammability.
Still, battery technology has greatly improved in recent years and looks like it will continue to do so.
Professor Sadoway says the real problem with electric cars might be our own expectations.
But if you are not "most people", there is another option.
California company Tesla has launched an all-electric sports car that has speed, power, range, and looks sharp.

Former England players Paul Ince, Les Ferdinand, Paul Merson, Des Walker and Lee Sharpe were among those taking part in the game at Sincil Bank.
Their team played against a Keith Alexander XI including members of Lincoln's 2003 play-off final squad.
More than 1,000 supporters bought tickets for the game.
Money raised from the event will go to the family of Alexander, who died suddenly aged 53.
A survey of the prison numbers released on Thursday revealed that HMP Swansea was holding 145 more inmates than the 219 it should be accommodating.
Research by the pressure group the Howard League for Penal Reform said that nearly two-thirds of Britain's prisoners were being held in overcrowded jails.
It estimated that 52,500 people were in jails running above capacity - with some buildings holding almost double the number of recommended inmates.
The latest revelation is another blow for Swansea prison - a category B establishment, built in 1861 - which has suffered a series of criticisms in recent months.
In April, an inspector's report called for urgent attention to the prison's B wing to avoid it collapsing.
It also said work should be done to improve cleanliness and sanitation, and that segregated and vulnerable patients in an underground part of the prison should be provided with toilets.
Although the hard work of staff was recognised by the inspector, the prison is a Victorian institution struggling to meet modern standards.
The latest figures highlighting overcrowding will renew calls for the building to be modernised or replaced.
Soaring prison numbers mean that many prisoners are doubling up in cells meant for one.
The worst prison in Britain was named as HMP Preston with 661 prisoners - but only 356 places.
Director of the Howard League, Frances Crook, has called on the government to include a compulsory limit on the prison population in the Criminal Justice Bill - due to be published later this year.
"Our prisons are becoming no more than warehouses once again," she said.
"The consequences of overcrowding are jeopardising both the safe running of the prison system and the rehabilitation of individual offenders.
"If prison is to serve any useful purpose it must be to return prisoners to the community better equipped to lead crime-free lives.
The prison population currently stands at 71,471 and is beginning to climb after a drop of several hundred earlier in the summer.
This rise goes against the normal summer-time pattern of an overall fall in the number of inmates.
Prison numbers have spiralled from 45,500 in June 1992, and have jumped 6,000 since the start of the year.
Overall, 64 jails are now overcrowded, said the charity.
The figures are taken from the Home Office research, development and statistics directorate.
The occupancy figures relate to the number of prisoners jails were built to hold.

Blind Ambition initially asked people for help via their Facebook site.
But following complaints from Caerphilly council over bus stop graffiti, the band posted a message asking fans not to vandalise property.
The band have recently released their debut single Judgement Day and fans are campaigning to get it in the charts.
The five piece heavy metal rock band whose members come from Aberdare, Blackwood, Newport and Cardiff formed in 2007.
Blind Ambition have built up a loyal fan base over the last three years and are well established on the live music scene in south Wales.
They've recently released their debut single and lead singer Martin Care says they asked fans via their Facebook site for help with raising their profile.
Martin admits that there's so much competition for publicity amongst unsigned bands nowadays that they asked fans to use their imagination in promoting the band.
"We've been handing out flyers in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport," he said.
"Some fans have been going door to door with flyers and others have been wearing jackets with Blind Ambition on the back of them.
The first the band knew about the vandalism was when they received an e-mail from Caerphilly council on 26 August telling them about it and asking for their co-operation in removing the graffiti.
Two bus stops had been vandalised - one in Blackwood, the other in Pontllanfraith.
The band were told that if they failed to cooperate the council would charge them for the cost of removing the graffiti.
Martin says they immediately offered to clean the graffiti themselves and posted a message on Facebook asking fans not to vandalise bus stops.
Martin says that despite this incident, fans' help with publicity, especially the creation of a Facebook group to promote their single has proved successful.
"Last Friday we played at Le Pub in Newport and the place was packed," he said.
"Loads of people were talking to us about the single and singing along to Judgement Day.
"Our main objective is to get the band recognised and with the fans' help we've done that.
The 22-year-old signed his first professional contract at Old Trafford in 2006 after emerging through the county's academy.
But he has struggled to force his way into the first team picture and has not played a County Championship game since May 2008.
His last appearance came in the Pro40 defeat by Warwickshire last month.
They lost the final Test by four wickets to become the first side since New Zealand in 1978 to lose 3-0.
New Zealand had been bowled out for 218 , leaving England 284 to win.
He said the loss of bowlers Chris Martin and Kyle Mills was always going to mean an uphill struggle.
"But no complaints, it wasn't to be.
Sunday's win over Canada was not pretty - we did not manage to annihilate them, score 400 and bowl them out for 60 - but we did what we had to do.
After what had happened over the previous 24 hours, it was most important to get the win under our belts and put all the off-field problems behind us.
Freddie Flintoff has apologised for the events of Friday night, which you will no doubt have read all about, and the other five players involved are devastated about what they did.
We know what is expected from us - the boundaries are laid down so we know what we can and can't do.
Despite what some people have said, I do not think we have a problem with drinking within the team.
There has never been a curfew put in place by management but in all my time with England it has been spelt out by the coach that players are expected to behave responsibly and prepare for matches in the right way.
It has always been left up to individuals to decide exactly how they do that.
Although this could be a long World Cup campaign, we viewed Friday's match as crucial.
I do not think we froze under pressure but we did not play as well as New Zealand, who adapted to the conditions more quickly than we did.
There were some pleasing things to take out of the match, including the batting of Kevin Pietersen, who adopted a patient approach against his usual instincts.
But again we lost a clump of wickets - three in two overs - and I have to hold my hand up as the first of those, trying to get the ball a little too fine after the third man fielder was brought up.
New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming demonstrated his great cricket brain in his use of bowlers but we were surprised at how well Shane Bond bowled on a slow wicket.
When it came their turn to bat, their run chase was superb, partly because the target was not high enough and they knew if they stayed in they would get the runs required.
We missed Freddie against Canada on Sunday - he is two players in one, bowls at 90mph and is a good batsman - and the events of the weekend put us under undue pressure.
We were short of a third player bowling at over 80mph to hit them hard so that was why we were unable to bowl them out, and we learned a little more about the balance of the side.
At least Ravi Bopara had an opportunity to get a few overs under his belt, and his batting also showed an impressive maturity under real pressure on a difficult wicket.
If a deputy is needed for Michael Vaughan, I think the management will look at the team and make a decision from there.
I do not have a lot of captaincy experience in my professional career but the vice-captaincy is an important role and of course I would like to be given that responsibility.
My priority, and that of the whole team now, though, is to concentrate on a must-win game next Saturday against Kenya.
We are all disappointed with what happened over the weekend but hopefully now we can put this to bed and move on.
His suggestion that Morag Pirie should have "been at home cooking" and not running the line in his side's 1-0 defeat by Montrose is being investigated by the Scottish Football Association.
The Third Division club insist that the comments were made after the match, not to a reporter, in a light-hearted and throwaway manner and were not intended to be taken seriously.
But Hetherston told BBC Scotland that it was only the suggestion about her cooking that was meant as a joke.
And the SFA's general purposes committee has already sent a letter to Hetherston asking for him to explain his comments.
"We are aware of it and we have contacted the chairman of the committee and they are aware of the comments.
"We've got a meeting in December and what we will do is write to him to explain the comments he is alleged to have made to find out whether they are accurately attributable to him.
"When that is established then we can deal with the matter, but we would like to get his comments before the next meeting in December.
"She should be at home making the tea or the dinner for her man who comes in after he has been to the football.

After about two hours of fighting around dawn, President Idriss Deby said government troops were in full control.
Chad accuses Sudan of supporting and arming the attackers while Sudan says Chad backs rebels in its Darfur region.
The UN Security Council urged both nations to resolve differences through talks and not support hostile actions.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was "greatly troubled by the worsening security situation in Chad".
A BBC correspondent in N'Djamena said gunfire and shelling began at dawn.
Mr Deby said a small rebel column attempted to enter the capital but was "completely destroyed".
Correspondent Stephanie Hancock told the BBC News website that government forces had piled bodies of what they said were United Force for Change rebels on the front steps of the National Assembly.
Many more had been rounded up and were being guarded by troops.
Mr Deby said elections scheduled for early next month would go ahead as planned.
The rebels have vowed to overthrow Mr Deby before the polls, which the opposition are boycotting.
The rebels accuse Mr Deby of being a dictator and say they want to organise a national forum that will lead to a transitional government and then democratic elections.
A spokesman for the rebels told the BBC they had not been defeated and would attack N'Djamena again.
Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the UN envoy of France, which has some 1,350 troops in its former colony, said the rebels came from Sudan's Darfur region.
Chad, which is rich in oil, has been hit by the conflict in Darfur, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing across the border.
Anyone hoping to find a clear winner in the lead-up award ceremonies would have been hard pushed to pick a clear favourite.
Lord of the Rings won best film at the Baftas, Moulin Rouge took the US National Board of Review's top prize while In The Bedroom was named best drama by the International Press Academy.
But it was the Golden Globes which came closest to picking the eventual winners on Oscar night.
The Globes also predicted the best foreign language movie, with Bosnia's No Man's Land beating the hotly tipped French romantic-comedy Ameile.
Ron Howard's Oscar win for best director for A Beautiful Mind was one of the very few predicted victories.
The former TV actor won the outstanding directorial achievement at the Directors' Guild Awards (DGA).
The DGA winner has won the best director Oscar in 49 out of the last 53 years.
Anyone hoping to guess the winners after the Baftas would have been sorely disappointed.
Broadbent did win a Bafta, but for Moulin Rouge and not for his Oscar-winning performance in Iris.
In the Bedroom's Sissy Spacek was 4/6 favourite to pick up best actress at the Oscars after her wins at the Golden Globes and the Los Angeles Film Critics' Association.
But it was Halle Berry's performance in Monster's Ball which wowed the Academy voters, as well as at the Screen Actors' Guild Awards and the National Board of Review.
Tim Brain said he was concerned about the feelings of the families of victims as well as the legal questions raised by the documentary, "Fred and Rose West - The Murders" which was broadcast earlier this week.
After watching all three episodes of the programme, the Mr Brain said he found it "sickening and unjustified".
"I have my own opinion on the ethics and the quality of the production but I shall leave it to members of the public to draw their own conclusions.
Mr Brain will now write to the Attorney General and the Independent Television Commission (ITC) repeating the complaints made before the programme was screened.
"He said he had a sworn affidavit that anything that was going to be used was going to be used appropriately but did not have the benefit of seeing the tapes.
"The programme was fairly out of context and not of the best taste.
"Some of the allegations they used to boost their ratings were in fact totally inaccurate.
Mr Brain said that speculation that the programme would throw new light on the disappearance of Mary Bastholm, a 15-year-old Gloucester girl who vanished in January 1968, had been unfounded.
He said the constabulary was not opposed to the making of documentaries about the West case and had never tried to stop Creative Consortium broadcasting the series.
"What we object to is the use of this prosecution material which is subject to legal privilege.
"Our second concern is for the feelings of the families of victims and for the relatives and for those involved in the inquiry.
The chief constable's reaction to the programme was supported by Caroline Roberts, 45, who was abducted and abused by Fred and Rose West.
The mother-of-two, from Cinderford, Gloucestershire, said she was relieved that the documentaries playing the killer's voice were over.
Fred and Rose West killed nine young girls including their 16-year-old daughter, Heather, at 25 Cromwell street, Gloucester, and buried them under the house or in the garden.
They also killed Fred West's daughter Charmaine, 8, and buried her under the floor of their previous home at 25 Midland road, Gloucester.
Fred West was charged with the murder of his first wife, Catherine, and his Scottish lover and nanny Anne McFall.
Fred West hanged himself in prison on New Year's Day, 1995 while awaiting trial - Rose West was later convicted of ten murders and jailed for life.
She has recently declared she is dropping plans to appeal.
Harriet Harman is pressed on Sir Fred Goodwin's pension
Labour's deputy leader made the blunder as she stood in for Gordon Brown at prime minister's questions.
The official record shows the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief was knighted "for services to banking".
Sir Fred has faced calls to be stripped of the honour for helping drive RBS to the brink of ruin.
Ms Harman, who has been the most outspoken Cabinet critic of Sir Fred's �700,000-a-year pension deal, was challenged about the honour by Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Elfyn LLwyd.
But immediately after the prime minister's question time session, Ms Harman was forced to correct the mistake.
Ms Harman had been led by "her own particular prejudices in this regard" and a desire to defend the government's decision to recommend Sir Fred for an honour, he suggested.
Shadow Commons leader, Alan Duncan, for the Conservatives, also joined in with criticism of Ms Harman.
He said "Once again, in her eagerness to hide Labour's cosy relationship with Sir Fred Goodwin and his government-endorsed perks, Harriet Harman has ignored the facts.
In June 2004, when Frederick Anderson Goodwin was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, there was no mention of his charity work in official Downing Street briefings.
The prime minister's official spokesman said Sir Fred "undertook many challenging projects that benefited both his company and the Scottish economy as a whole".
But the honour was attacked at the time by trade unions who branded him a "fat cat" for accepting a �900,000 bonus on top of his then annual salary of �1m.
He has also faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood, with more than 800 people signing a petition on the Downing Street website.
Ms Harman told MPs at prime minsters' questions the government was taking "all steps" to challenge the enforceability of Sir Fred's pension contract.
She said UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body set up to manage the taxpayers' interests in the part-nationalised banks, had been asked to investigate Sir Fred's contract.
At the weekend, Ms Harman hinted the law may be changed to prevent Sir Fred collecting the money, saying the contract may be legally enforceable but was "not enforceable in the court of public opinion".
But Liberal Democrat deputy leader Vince Cable said the government should use existing legislation to strip Sir Fred as opposed to her "rather eccentric proposal for a 'Harriet's Law'".
Mr Cable told Ms Harman there was "growing anger in what you called the court of public opinion" about "lavish and generous pensions" not just for bankers but for "fat cats" in the public sector including Whitehall mandarins and ministers.
Earlier in the session, acting Conservative leader William Hague taunted Ms Harman about her alleged Labour leadership ambitions saying "this could be her moment".
To howls of laughter from Tory MPs, Mr Hague compared Labour's deputy leader to Churchill, who stepped in when his party lost confidence in its leader.
He also invoked Harold Macmillan, who took over from Anthony Eden.
Appeal judges in Edinburgh were told Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi is terminally ill and should be released on compassionate grounds.
However, prosecutors argued the gravity of the offences means he should remain in jail.
A decision on whether he will be released will be taken later.
Al Megrahi's defence team at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh said the former Libyan intelligence agent, diagnosed with prostate cancer, should be released in order to reside with his family in Scotland while receiving medical treatment.
Maggie Scott QC said the gravity of the offences Al Megrahi was convicted of - the murder of 270 people in the 1988 atrocity - was not sufficient reason to oppose bail.
The defence QC also pointed to delays in holding the appeal and adding that Al Megrahi's liberty had been restricted for more than 17 years.
The court heard Al Megrahi was married and had five children aged between 10 and 25 and two grandchildren.
She added that his family had moved to Glasgow and had visas to visit and reside in Scotland.
"If released on bail the appellant would reside with his family," Ms Scott added.
She added that Al Megrahi was not considered a "flight risk".
"There is no security issue in respect of granting interim liberation," she said.
The court heard Al Megrahi had been an inmate in the open part of HMP Greenock for some time and had been a lawful prisoner with no disciplinary record.
It also heard there were concerns about the "psychological well-being" of Al Megrahi.
This was related to the conviction, along with a deep-seated isolation from his friends, family and religion.
He was also suffering from stress following his cancer diagnosis, the court heard.
Ms Scott added that Al Megrahi's physical condition had also deteriorated and that the lack of privacy in prison was causing him "considerable distress".
It is more than five years since Al Megrahi's lawyers presented papers to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission claiming his conviction for the murder of 270 people was unsafe.
That case reached the Appeal Court in June last year and since then has been bogged down by legal arguments.
Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed in the bombing, was in court for the hearing and afterwards said he was "disappointed" a decision had not been reached.
"It seems he has not got very long to live and therefore the decision needs to be made as urgently as possible," said Dr Swire.

Championship side Preston will be hoping to stun Premier League high-flyers Tottenham, while Portsmouth face a long trip to League One Carlisle.
There are five all-Premier League ties with holders Manchester United hosts to recently promoted Wolves.
In the pick of the other ties, Chelsea host west London rivals QPR and Blackburn go to Nottingham Forest.
Barnsley will be looking to take the Premier League scalp of Burnley at Oakwell, while Port Vale, the only League Two club still in the competition, travel to Scunthorpe.
A spokesperson from the Syrian foreign ministry has said that the Syrian president is "fully committed" to adhering to a ceasefire between the government and opposition forces in Syria under a peace plan negotiated by the international envoy, Kofi Annan.
Jihad Makdissi told the Today Programme's Justin Webb that "we have already achieved several pullbacks", he said going on to say that the Annan plan asks for the cessation of violence from all sides, not just the government.
He said that social media could not be relied upon to monitor the violence, adding that "we have a clear plan to enable Kofi Annan's plan".
"The recipe for success is not only in the hands of Syria", he said, adding that it is also down to the country's surrounding who have said publicly that they are arming the rebels.
"The way out is the evolution and not the armed confrontation," he said, "so all parties must come to the table for dialogue".
He maintained that "whether people like it or not", President Assad still has the support of the majority of the 23 million strong Syrian population.
The Today programme's Tom Bateman spoke to Abu an activist in Homs who said that although there is no shooting, there is no signs of the Syrian army troops withdrawing from the cities.
He said that there are tanks and soldiers on the streets and snipers on the roofs while the Syrian opposition army has withheld from shooting on the government forces.
World affairs correspondent Fergal Keane, who was reporting from the Syria/ Turkey border, said that the political crisis has not even begun to be addressed.
He said that the test will be whether the government will allow the huge demonstrations that were seen at the beginning to take place because it should be possible with a ceasefire.
He said that he thought the opposition will not want to be seen to be the aggressors and so would adhere to the ceasefire.
Behind the scenes, there has been a great deal of arm twisting of President Assad to make a political process work but the opposition will not go into negotiations that will see the president remain in power.
Insurance firm Aviva has announced that chief executive Andrew Moss will be leaving with immediate effect.
The move comes after the firm suffered the embarrassment of losing a shareholder vote on executive pay at its annual meeting last week.
Aviva shareholder and former Chief Executive of Greggs Bakers, Sir Michael Darrington, told the Today programme that Aviva must make sure Mr Moss' successor is paid "significantly less".
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has just been declared the winner of Haiti's presidential elections, faces daunting challenges as he contemplates his new mandate.
But analysts say that with Haiti shunned by the international community, Mr Aristide faces a tough job bringing the country out of its current economic and political crisis.
The announcement of the final results by Haiti's provisional electoral council was always going to be a formality.
Nobody seriously doubted that Jean Bertrand Aristide would win the race against three other relatively unknown candidates.
It is difficult to determine if there was any fraud.
But the turnout for the poll was low and it is not clear if that was because of voter apathy or because Haitians heeded a call by the main opposition parties to boycott the poll.
Either way, Mr Aristide has a hugely difficult job on his hands.
Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere, yet the main donor countries have frozen direct government to government aid.
And they have blocked development lines because of concerns about election irregularities from earlier in the year.
The infrastructure in Haiti has almost completely collapsed and drug-trafficking has corrupted both the judicial system and the police force.
To complicate things further, relations with the political opposition have almost completely collapsed.
A demolition crew pulled down the house early on Friday, according to people gathered outside the site.
Bedecked with posters, slogans and flags, the city-centre shack had been attracting attention from neighbours and passers-by.
The Yu family were refusing to move because they said the compensation being offered was far too low.
Later, the local government admitted it had taken matters into its own hands after negotiations with the Yu's broke down.
The Yus' home was one of more than 160 houses and shops that the local government decided to tear down in 2005 to spruce up the roadside area.
But virtually all traces of the house were quickly removed.
The Yus' tumble-down home, near many Beijing tourist attractions, was one of hundreds of "nail houses" that have sprung up across China.
These are houses whose owners refuse to budge to make way for redevelopment projects.
Families often complain that they are forced out of their homes and are not given enough compensation.
The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions said this had taken place over an eight-year period leading up to this summer's games.
"[The] authorities have used tactics of harassment, repression, imprisonment and even violence against residents and activists," it said.
DaimlerChrysler has reportedly approached Volvo about acquiring the Swedish truck maker's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC), possibly securing the Japanese car maker as a partner in trucks as well as cars.
DaimlerChrysler is making the move to further broaden its position as the world's largest truck maker, while Volvo seeks to end its current agreement with MMC.
The move would increase DaimlerChrysler's ownership in MMC to 37% from its current 34%.
"DaimlerChrysler is in the box seat in terms of [Mitsubishi] trucks," says Adam Collins, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.
It is a complicated deal that could possibly result in Volvo's teaming up with Nissan Diesel to manufacture trucks.
Volvo could be seeking to end its agreement with MMC following DaimlerChrysler's 34% acquisition last year.
Volvo had planned to invest $335 million later this year in a joint venture with MMC for bus and truck activities in which Volvo's equity stake would be 20%, based on an agreement dating from October 1999.
But Volvo is now uneasy about that deal following DaimlerChrysler's spring purchase.
Volvo's jitters surround the possibility that DaimlerChrysler could then assert its control over the Volvo-MMC project if it exercises its right to purchase MMC outright after 3 years.
The acquisition of MMC would help DaimlerChrysler make inroads into the Asian truck market.
As part of that strategy, DaimlerChrysler last year bought a 9% stake in South Korea's Hyundai.
Further acquisition of MMC might cause DaimlerChrysler to reconsider its 50-50 joint venture with Hyundai to manufacture trucks and buses.
Analysts have said the deal is merely a matter of time and price.
Despite these murmurings, DaimlerChrysler has refused to comment on the possibility of the deal.
DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp told reporters last week that his company was standing pat.
"If there is a desire to make changes on the part of Volvo, we would of course talk about it," he said.
In 2005, he received a seven-year jail term for membership of a terrorist group, after a year-long retrial in Hamburg.
But Germany's Constitutional Court ordered his release from prison in February 2006, pending the outcome of an appeal against his sentence.
At that appeal, in November 2006, he was convicted of being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder.
At his first trial in 2003 he had also been sentenced to 15 years for being an accessory to the 9/11 plot, but that verdict was quashed on appeal.
It had been widely expected that Motassadek would be acquitted at the retrial, after his friend and fellow Moroccan - Abdelghani Mzoudi - was cleared on the same charges by the same Hamburg court in 2004.
For Motassadek's retrial, the US justice department released summaries from the interrogation of several al-Qaeda suspects, including Ramzi Binalshibh.
The prosecution at the retrial had hoped US intelligence agencies would reveal more information about their sources.
Mr Binalshibh, a Yemeni citizen dramatically arrested in Pakistan and allegedly a key planner of the 9/11 attacks, told how Motassadek had taken part in vitriolic anti-US discussions at the home of Mohammed Atta, the alleged pilot of one of the hijacked planes.
Motassadek always said he was just one of thousands of young Muslims who came to Europe to study in the mid-1990s.
But he admitted having spent time at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and having signed Atta's will.
During his time there, prosecutors in his original trial charged, he met Mohammed Atta.
While in Hamburg, Atta and several others founded a radical Islamic organisation, which fostered links with Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, prosecutors alleged.
They describe the group as having "a violent Islamic ideology aimed at attacking countries such as the United States".
Prosecutors said Motassadek "maintained intensive contacts over several years" with Atta and other 9/11 suspects Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah.
The members of the Hamburg cell arrived in Germany between 1992 and 1997 from various Arab countries, prosecutors alleged.
All, like Motassadek, came in order to follow further education courses.
Prosecutors said Motassadek acted as the group's "treasurer", handling funds for the living expenses of three of the hijackers - including Atta - who took flight lessons in the US for the 9/11 attacks.
Motassadek first came under suspicion in November 2001, when German authorities discovered that he had power of attorney over a bank account held by Shehhi, who allegedly flew the second plane into the World Trade Center.
He was questioned and released, but remained under police surveillance.
He went on trial in Hamburg in October 2002.
In the summer of 1998 he got a job at a Volkswagen factory.
He was also involved in the running of the al-Quds mosque in Hamburg, which prosecutors say was the focal point of the group's activities.
Motassadek is understood to be married to a woman from Belarus, with whom he has two children.
Following his arrest in November of 2002, university officials described Motassadek as a "normal student" eager to take his exams despite the allegations against him.
The scientists at the Children's Hospital Medical Center of Cincinnati found that a chemical called eotaxin, a protein, controls inflammation of the intestine in allergic reactions.
Eotaxin draws a type of cell normally found in blood - eosinophils - into inflammatory tissue.
By genetically engineering mice without the eotaxin - a type of chemokine - the team led by Dr Marc Rothenberg eliminated the eosinophil cells from the small intestine.
Their accumulation in the blood increased at the same time.
He says up to 30% of people are affected by allergies - double the proportion of a few decades ago.
His research investigated allergies not related to anaphylaxis, a severe form of reaction which constricts breathing and can cause death in extreme cases.
"We have not only seen a marked increase in the incidence of allergic diseases, but the emergence of allergic reactions to common environmental substances has also increased at an alarming rate," he added.
However, Dr Hasan Arshad at the David Hide Asthma and Allergy Centre at St Mary's Hospital, Isle of Wight, said the finding was a "small piece in a very large puzzle".
"But there are at least 20 chemokines and 15 to 20 other chemicals involved and they all interact in a very complex way.
It was, though, helpful to have more information about the chemical's role.
The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Millions of people have their savings or pensions in such policies but many - angry about poor returns - want to take their money out.
However, despite the improving stock market, the exit penalties imposed by life companies, called Market Value Adjusters, are in some cases, going up.
These "MVAs" are designed to stop investors leaving early with more than their fair share of the fund, damaging the prospects for those who stay.
"I got in contact with them and eventually they wrote back and said 'Hard luck, that is how it is'".
These firms have defended their exit penalties, telling Money Box that although the market has recovered there is a long way to go.
But at other weaker insurers - which have transferred the bulk of their assets to safe investments like gilts and bonds - the outlook for policyholders is far worse.
Mr McPhail said investors in these firms will continue paying very high penalties for transferring out early.
And some firms are actually increasing their exit penalties.
At Scottish Provident they are up by six per cent since last October, at 33%.

Ms Flint resigned as Europe minister on Friday, claiming he operated a "two-tier" government via an "inner" circle.
Senior female figures were regarded as "little more than window dressing" by the prime minister, Ms Flint argued.
Fellow MP Geraldine Smith said Ms Flint would "regret" her comments, saying she should have thought twice about them.
In her resignation letter, Ms Flint said Mr Brown's government was not "inclusive" and suggested she had been ignored when she attended cabinet meetings.
Her comments have been questioned since less than 24 hours earlier, in the wake of former Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell's resignation from the cabinet, she had proclaimed her loyalty to Gordon Brown.
As a close friend of former communities secretary Hazel Blears, she had been widely expected to follow Ms Blears' example and resign as soon as polls closed for England's local elections on Thursday night.
But, instead, she insisted she was "proud" to serve Mr Brown and would stay in government.
Geraldine Smith said Ms Flint had been expecting a promotion in Friday's reshuffle and had been disappointed.
"She's been upset and she has had a bit of a strop," she told the BBC.
Deputy Labour Leader and Minister for Women and Equality, Harriet Harman, also rejected Ms Flint's comments while acknowledging "progress" needed to be made in getting more women into senior positions in government.
She said it was untrue that Mr Brown "doesn't take women in politics seriously".
Several high-profile female ministers, including Ms Blears, former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and housing minister Margaret Beckett, left government in Friday's reshuffle.
But Mr Brown insisted there was still a strong female representation in his cabinet, pointing to the promotion of Yvette Cooper to work and pensions secretary.
Ms Flint has been replaced by ex-MEP Glenys Kinnock, wife of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock.

World record holder and Olympic champion Usain Bolt storms to victory in the 100m at the London Grand Prix.
Now, just seven months on from a Test match debut against New Zealand, she finds herself in the middle of a World Cup campaign.
And it offers her the opportunity to out-do her cricketing hero, Darren Gough, whose hopes of World Cup glory came to nothing in South Africa two years ago.
Like Gough, 19-year-old Brunt was born in Barnsley, so it is no surprise that she sees him as a perfect role model.
"I think he would have been in the Barnsley first team when I was in the under-11s.
It was Gough's younger brother, Adrian, however, who had an active role in Brunt's development as captain of the Barnsley second XI in 2003, a team which also included her own brother and father.
"She used at bat three or four and have a bowl as well but at that stage she was lacking a bit of confidence.
"It was a case of getting her to believe in herself because she always had talent.
"It's the same with a lot of people when they're young, they feel out of it a bit when they're playing in an adult team and don't have that much confidence in themselves," said Adrian.
Brunt played her first one-day international against South Africa prior to the World Cup and figures of 1-14 from seven overs proved she could keep things tight with a white ball.
Her debut in the tournament proper came against favourites Australia, but she was denied a chance to bowl at the likes to Belinda Clark and Karen Rolton when rain washed out the second half of the match.
Brunt finally took the new ball three games later against India, when she and Lucy Pearson tried in vain to salvage the situation after England had posted a disappointing total of only 139.
In an echo of the nickname of another great Yorkshire fast bowler, Fred Trueman, Clare Taylor says Brunt can be a "fiery" character.
It is an assessment with which Adrian Gough agrees.
Channelling that aggression productively is Brunt's challenge in the weeks - and years - ahead.
Ospreys responded well after their Heineken Cup exit
The fly-half had a hand in both Ospreys tries, setting up Andy Bishop for the opening touchdown on 22 minutes before finding Alun Wyn Jones on 47 minutes.
Hook converted both scores, as well as kicking over three penalties.
Leicester never settled in the game, with all their six points coming in the first half from the boot of Andy Goode.
The victory avenged the Ospreys's 2007 final defeat by Leicester and was the perfect response after their disappointing loss to Saracens in the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup last weekend.
Tigers coach Marcelo Loffreda played into the Welsh side's hands, opting for centre Ollie Smith ahead of the more enterprising Tom Varndell on the right wing in a bid to counteract the threat of Shane Williams.
'This victory represents a turning point for us' - Lyn Jones
The English side dominated the early exchanges, taking the lead on four minutes when Goode kicked over a 25-metre penalty after a ruck infringement.
And the Premiership team's forwards soon camped themselves deep inside Ospreys territory, but a fumble from centre Dan Hipkiss thwarted any hopes of a score.
But Goode - who had missed two earlier penalty efforts - doubled Leicester's lead with a drop-goal on 16 minutes.
But within six minutes the Ospreys, who featured 11 of the Wales side that beat England in the Six Nations, were ahead courtesy of Hook's vision and Leicester's lackadaisical defending.
The fly-half popped an inside pass for centre Bishop, who brushed off limp challenges from George Chuter and Goode before diving over for the first try of the game.
Hook added the extras and Leicester, after imposing their early authority, were beginning to lose the plot, with the Wales number 10 pulling the creative strings.
A wonderful, fleet-footed break from Hook required a full-stretch tackle from Harry Ellis to prevent a certain try-scoring opportunity.
Indiscipline from the Tigers forwards resulted in captain Martin Corry receiving a stern lecture from referee Alain Rolland, warning any further discrepancies would lead to the sin-bin.
But despite their dominance, the Ospreys failed to capitalise - Hook missed a 35th-minute penalty attempt, while Leicester just about cleared a Williams chip into the try area - and they had to make do with a slender one-point lead at the interval.
But that advantage was extended seven minutes after the break through Wyn Jones, courtesy of a scything break from the excellent Lee Byrne.
The Wales full-back was assisted by a missed tackle from Chuter in midfield, but quick recycling and a change of direction from Jonny Vaughton found Hook, whose perfectly timed pass found the powerful lock for a five-metre touchdown.
Leicester, subdued and lacking any attacking threat, were soon chasing an 11-point deficit when a thumping Hook penalty from the right touchline sailed through the middle of the posts.
With Leicester's beleaguered forwards looking increasingly forlorn, the Ospreys squeezed further penalties from their tired and dejected opponents, with Hook adding six points with two fine penalty strikes to seal the game and the trophy.
'We were second best by quite some way' - Martin Corry
The Ospreys kept pushing forward and replacement Gareth Owen touched down in the corner after a dazzling Williams break, only for referee Rolland to overrule the score for an earlier forward pass.
The decision had little effect on the Ospreys as the celebrations began in earnest two minutes later when Rolland blew for full time.
The bluefin tuna weighs 232 kg - nearly four times as much as the average Japanese man.
It was caught off the northern tip of Japan's main island of Honshu, in waters famed for high quality fish.
Tuna is prized in Japan, where people eat it raw in sushi, but there is concern that stocks are dwindling.
The record-breaking tuna was put on the block in the first auction of the new year at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market.
The tuna was bought jointly by one of the city's most upmarket restaurants, and an entrepreneur from Hong Kong who runs a chain of sushi bars.
Last year a similar fish made less than 10 million yen.
Bluefin tuna is known as the king of sushi and the Japanese eat more of it than any other nation, according to the BBC's correspondent in Tokyo, Roland Buerk.
Conservationists are calling for a moratorium on fishing to save the bluefin tuna from extinction in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.
The president of the convention on the future of Europe, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, unveiled the constitution's first 15 draft articles on Thursday.
But none of the chapters mentions any deity, or any explicitly religious or Christian values supposed to underpin the European project.
Some countries - particularly Poland, a future EU member - had argued for such a mention.
The Vatican and smaller denominations, including Jewish, Muslim and Protestant organisations, have also advocated its inclusion.
But others - including France, a strictly secular state - have strongly opposed it.
Last month the European Convention - which brings together 105 representatives of the 15 EU governments, legislatures and institutions - held a stormy debate on how the charter should deal with religion.
Correspondents say the issue could still re-surface in a preamble to the document, which is expected to be completed by the summer.
It distinguishes between areas of the "exclusive competency" of the EU - such as customs union, monetary policy and conservation of marine resources - and "shared competency" - the internal market, agriculture and fisheries and the environment.
But the BBC's Chris Morris says that while Mr Giscard D'Estaing has sought to boost democracy and to simplify the workings of the EU, he has ruffled more than a few feathers along the way.
One UK representative at the convention, Welsh Secretary Peter Hain, said the draft did not reflect a consensus of people on the convention.
"A lot of representatives are wondering whether the people who drew up this document have been going to a different convention," PA news agency quoted him as saying.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is separated out and injected into porous rock - normally under the sea - from which oil and gas have been extracted.
Porous rocks are an ideal place to store CO2 because they have already stored oil or gas for millions of years without any escaping.
The Peterhead plant in the North East of Scotland, uses a chemical process to separate the CO2 from North Sea gas.
Either way, once it has been "captured", the CO2 is injected back into the rocks, using technology which the oil and gas industry has long used to help push extra oil out of nearly-exhausted wells.
Currently, about 50,000 equal pay cases are being brought by underpaid local council workers.
But the commission says this could rise to 150,000 this year, clogging the tribunal system and forcing women to wait years for what is owed to them.
It wants representative actions, where hundreds of cases are heard together.
The commission says such actions could unblock the tribunal system and reduce the number of cases by more than 90%.
Trevor Phillips, chairman of the commission, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the current system was on the brink of "meltdown".
"Women have retired - some have died - before their case has been in the system".
He said the Equal Pay Act, introduced almost 40 years ago, had "reached its sell-by date".
"It's time for new legislation, fit for this century, to help sort out this age-old problem," he said.
Local Government Employers has been created to work with local authorities and other bodies to resolve pay, pensions and employment contracts.
Its managing director, Jan Parkinson, blamed a delay in resolving pay issues on a culture of no-win-no-fee lawyers and called for "negotiation and not litigation".
Ms Parkinson said councils were working to achieve equal pay but warned there could be knock-on effects on other services.
"While councils spend around �85bn there will be some implications to some services in some councils despite the work that they are doing to mitigate the effects," she said.
The government has come under fire as thousands of NHS jobs have been lost across the country.
Tony Blair admits the NHS reforms have reached a "crunch point", but remains determined to press ahead.
Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow, a member of the Commons health committee, said it was time to question ministers on the issue.
And last month Labour MP Kevin Barron, the committee chairman, warned trust budget deficits were "clearly threatening to destabilise" the health service.
More than 7,000 job cuts have been announced across the NHS in recent weeks, as trusts struggle to balance their books.
It is thought the service in England will end the financial year with a deficit in excess of �600m.
Ministers argue that only a small proportion of trusts are in financial difficulties, and that the projected deficit is only around 1% of the total NHS budget.
But some trusts are angry that they face cuts despite balancing their books, in order to bail out others who are in deficit.
Mr Blair told an audience of senior health workers on Monday that the NHS faced a very tough challenge, but he said reform was vital to ensure the service was more responsive to patients.
Mr Burstow said the committee had not yet signed off on the terms of reference for an inquiry.
Mr Burstow said the NHS appeared to be in "perpetual revolution" and blighted by instability.
Statistics from the Registrar General for Scotland show 382 users lost their lives after taking drugs last year, a rise of 15%.
Ministers are so concerned at the rise that they have launched the biggest probe of its kind into Scotland's drug-taking culture.
They are concerned, in particular, that well over half the victims were older drug takers.
The death toll includes 153 people in their late 20s or early 30s and 92 were aged 35 to 45.
David Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, argues that more help needs to be offered to older addicts.
He said that, for long-term users, the need for higher amounts of drugs to maintain their habit increases the risk of overdose.
David Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, argues that more help needs to be offered to older addicts.
"The figures underline the continuing need to tackle the root causes of problem drug use as well as to improve the wide range of treatment, services and education necessary to minimise harm to drug users.
"There is a clear need for overdose training to be given to the drug using community and those who live and work with them.
Heroin continues to be the drug most likely to kill, and there has been a substantial rise in the number of cases in which methadone was involved.
Lord Justice General Lord Hamilton delivers the court's decision
The permission of the High Court in Edinburgh was required before the proceedings by Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi could be formally abandoned.
It comes as the Scottish Government considers his requests for either release or transfer to a Libyan jail.
Seven US senators have urged Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to make Megrahi serve his sentence in Scotland.
The Libyan's legal team outlined his current state of health to the appeal hearing.
"This has now reached the terminal stage and my client's condition has recently worsened very considerably.
By dropping his appeal, Megrahi has removed one potential obstacle to his transfer to a jail in his homeland.
However, a Crown appeal against the length of his sentence is still ongoing.
Scotland's senior law officer, Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini QC, will now have to consider whether that should also be dropped.
A Crown Office statement said its appeal was "entirely separate" from Megrahi's appeal.
It said the lord advocate had not received any request to indicate whether the appeal would continue.
"The lord advocate has always been prepared to give any request her full and prompt consideration," it stressed.
It added that no information had been received about Megrahi's current medical situation which might need to be taken into account in handling the appeal.
Scotland's senior judge, the Lord Justice General, Lord Hamilton, said it was important the Crown appeal issue was resolved quickly.
"It appears to the court to be of the utmost importance that an early decision be made by the lord advocate as to whether she is to insist or not to insist on that appeal," he said.
Some relatives of the victims said the dropping of the appeal meant that many questions would now go unanswered.
The Reverend John Mosey, who lost his daughter in the bombing, described it as a "very sad day for Scottish justice".
"My feeling is that I would be happier if he was going home after the hearing of his appeal, either as an innocent man or as a guilty man," he said.
It emerged last week that the Libyan had applied to withdraw his second appeal against conviction.
It prompted claims he had been put under pressure to make the move - a suggestion the Scottish Government has strenuously denied.
Rev John Mosey, father of one of the victims, gives his reaction
The Justice Secretary is currently considering whether or not to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds or to allow his transfer to a prison in Libya.
He is expected to announce his decision within the next two weeks.
A letter from seven US senators has urged Mr MacAskill not to release Megrahi from jail.
The 57-year-old is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum of 27 years after being convicted in 2001 of the 1988 bombing which killed 270 people.
The senators want him to serve out the rest of his sentence in Scotland.
The Scottish Government has also come under pressure to recall parliament to discuss the issue.
However, presiding officer Alex Fergusson said that after weighing up "all the factors very carefully" he had decided against such a move.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales ahead of the party's Welsh conference, Mr Clegg said his party was answering a call for "something different in politics".
He is to attend a question and answer session with the party's Welsh leader Kirsty Williams later on Friday.
The conference runs on Saturday and Sunday at the Angel Hotel in Cardiff.
Mr Clegg will join Ms Williams on a visit to meet staff caring for sick and premature babies at the neonatal unit of the University Hospital of Wales.
They will later join the question and answer event to discuss 'The Future of Liberalism in Wales'.
"Everything that we offer as a party is answering that call for something different in politics so we can do things a lot better than we have done until now," Mr Clegg told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme.
Mr Clegg said he was determined to come second in the European elections around the UK, following last year's local elections when the party pushed Labour into third place.
In Wales, the Liberal Democrats gained an extra 21 councillors, but remained the party with the fewest overall number.
The BBC's Welsh affairs editor Vaughan Roderick said a lot of people in Wales would go along with the party's policies and philosophy.
"The trouble is they've got a cuckoo in the nest occupying their political space and that's Plaid Cymru.
This conference will be the first attended by Ms Williams since she became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats in December 2008.
The assembly member for Brecon and Radnorshire became Wales' first female party leader when she replaced Mike German.
She will give her speech at the conference on Saturday afternoon.

Afterwards Gavin said his daily dance training had been harder than his rugby workouts, but being on the show had helped him regain his "energy and drive".
EastEnders actor Scott Maslen was the second celeb to be booted off, but said being on the show had been one of the best experiences of his life.
There are now just three couples left in the race to lift the glitterball trophy, including psychologist Pamela Stephenson and her dance partner James Jordan.
Gavin Henson thinks former EastEnders actress Kara Tointon should win because he says she's such a natural dancer.
Kara did brilliantly in the semi-finals, finishing top of the leaderboard on Friday AND Saturday's shows.
But Countryfile and former Blue Peter presenter Matt Baker looks like he means business dancing the tango, and will no doubt be hoping he's still in with a chance of winning too.
Street entertainer Mario Morris demonstrates a card trick with Dippy Duck
Keen on magic since childhood, he decided to perfect his street act at the age of about 20.
Mario was inspired by a unicyclist in London's Covent Garden who made a silk handkerchief disappear.
His Cardiff School of Busking offers a three day intensive course to acts who want to hone their street skills.
Mario points out that while performers may have good circus or magic skills, to be a street entertainer they need to learn how to engage the passing public.
"The key to attracting a crowd is sound, movement and colour," he says.
"You have to make people curious - you have to be likeable otherwise people won't stay," he adds.
"Next step is to turn a crowd into an audience - a drunk man will attract a crowd but an audience is a completely different thing!"
The length of a street entertainer's performance can vary widely - Mario says 20 to 25 minutes is the norm for Cardiff, but it's only about 15 minutes in Spain, and in Edinburgh he was booked to perform for nearly an hour.
Although many performers make a living as street entertainers hired by local councils to add colour to their festivals, Mario says he feels no shame at being described as a busker.
Tottenham striker Peter Crouch says he is taking nothing for granted as he waits for England's World Cup squad announcement on 1 June but talks up the chances of his Spurs team-mate Ledley King.
Burley unveiled as Scotland manager
Controversy surrounded the appointment process to replace Alex McLeish and proved to be the first real test of Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith, who had only been in the job a matter of months.
Smith and the SFA drew up a four-man shortlist that included George Burley, Graeme Souness, Mark McGhee and Tommy Burns.
Media speculation pointed to Burley as the clear favourite and when questioned on television shortly before Burley's appointment, then Motherwell manager Mark McGhee insisted that he had not been told that his application had been unsuccessful.
This prompted a confrontational stance by Smith at the media conference to introduce Burley as Scotland manager, with the chief executive defending the SFA's handling of the affair.
Burley, for his part, used the press conference to give an impassioned gambit about how excited he was to be the Scotland manager and outlined his dream of taking the team to the World Cup finals whilst playing the brand of attacking football he had employed as a club manager.
Burley had to wait almost six weeks for his first match, a friendly at Hampden against Croatia.
The build-up to the game was overshadowed by a raft of squad withdrawals, with the game scheduled only three days before a crucial Old Firm match at Ibrox.
This culture of call-offs continued into the World Cup qualifying campaign and future friendly matches (there were 10 call-offs for the recent match in Japan), with Burley at one point making a joking remark that he had become "immune" to it.
Scotland's first World Cup qualifying match under Burley was the September 2008 encounter with Macedonia in Skopje.
As kick-off drew near, it became clear that the heat in the Macedonian capital would make it difficult for the Scots, who at this point had registered two draws and a defeat in three friendlies.
Questions were asked about why Scotland had accepted the scheduling of the game, which the home side went on to win 1-0, rather than pushing for a date in a less humid part of the year.
The issue was raised again when Burley requested that the Scottish Premier League season be delayed to give his squad more time to prepare for the trip to Norway.
Following an initial impasse, the SPL consented to the move but it backfired when Scotland suffered a 4-0 hammering in Oslo.
With World Cup qualifying Group 9 containing only five countries, compared to the six featured in all the other qualification sections, Scotland's last fixture was scheduled to kick-off earlier than those from other groups.
Therefore, in the event that the second-placed team in Scotland's group had a chance of making the play-offs, they would not know the outcome until all the other groups had been decided.
In the end, both Scotland and Norway's chances of reaching the play-offs were ended on the final day of qualifiers, making the point moot.
In true Scottish media timing, Burley was dealt an apparent double blow following the defeat to Macedonia with Rangers midfielder Lee McCulloch announcing his international retirement.
I didn't rush into Scotland decision - Boyd
McCulloch insisted he had made the decision before the defeat in Skopje and admitted that the media coverage had painted him as a villain.
In truth, McCulloch's move was unsurprising, as he had only featured in one of Burley's squads and was not a regular in Walter Smith's squad at Ibrox.
However, it sparked a somewhat acrimonious relationship between the Scotland manager and several other members of the Rangers squad.
In October 2008, Burley's side were drawing 0-0 with Norway at Hampden but still had three striking options on the bench in Kris Boyd, Chris Iwelumo and Steven Fletcher.
Burley, with only two substitutions remaining, elected to throw on Fletcher and the uncapped Iwelumo, neither of whom had yet scored for Scotland, leaving seven-time international scorer Boyd out altogether.
The move backfired with Wolves' Iwelumo missing an open goal and the game ending scoreless, leaving the Scots with only four points from their first three Group 9 matches.
The following day, Boyd announced that he would no longer be available for Scotland duty under Burley and the Rangers striker went on to become the Scottish Premier League's top goalscorer for season 2008/09.
Burley explains why he did not pick Boyd
With the SFA flooded with calls on the Monday, Burley reluctantly fronted a news conference to defend his decision to field Iwelumo instead of Boyd and insisted he only wanted players who were "totally committed".
Six months later, Scotland returned from a 3-0 defeat to the Netherlands in Amsterdam and stayed at the Cameron House Hotel, which was to become the scene of one of the most infamous incidents in the national team's recent history.
Captain Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor broke a curfew and were dropped to the bench for the next game against Iceland only three days later.
The Rangers pair were subsequently photographed making rude gestures to photographers and were eventually told they would never play for their country again.
The off-field events were enough to sour Burley's relationship with the media but the results gave the media more than enough fuel to criticise the Scotland manager.
It took Burley five internationals to record his first win with Scotland - a 2-1 win in Iceland - and only two more wins followed in the World Cup qualifying campaign.
However, the damage was done at home to the Norwegians, as the two defeats to the Netherlands were neither a disgrace nor unexpected.
In friendlies, Burley struggled to make his mark with draws at home to Croatia and Northern Ireland and defeats in the Czech Republic, Japan and Wales, where the 3-0 reverse provoked an angry reaction from the travelling fans.
The deal will create by far the largest sports retailer chain in the UK with 470 branches and a market share of around 16%.
Tom Hunter, the Scottish entrepreneur who set up Sports Division in the mid 1980s with a�10,000 loan, still owns 85% of the group and stands to make nearly �250m from the acquisition.
JJB Sports was set up by former Blackburn Rovers soccer star David Whelan in 1978.
The Wigan based entrepreneur is now thought to have amassed a fortune worth �180m by creating a 200 store chain.
Mr Hunter will now join JJB's board as deputy chairman.
"It also equips us to go into Europe - the group together can take on Europe," he said.
JJB said substantial cost savings were expected through integration of the head offices and in areas such as warehousing, advertising and marketing.
To help pay for the acquisition JJB is raising �105m through a rights issue.
Sports Division abandoned plans for a �350m flotation on the stockmarket two months ago following a downturn in High Street sales.
The announcement of the acquisition came just 24 hours after JJB announced it was in merger discussions with Sports Division.
Both companies have expanded rapidly in recent years on the back of the explosive growth in the sportswear market.
JJB said the two chains fitted well geographically, with Sports Division strongest in Scotland, London and the South East while JJB was concentrated in the North, North West and Midlands.
The Sports Division name will be phased out gradually.
The deal may prompt competition concerns, although the companies are confident it will not be blocked by the government.
Its boss Edgar Bronfman, said Mr Jobs' proposal was "without logic and merit".
At present, most download sites, including Apple's iTunes store, use such software to limit the number of machines on which songs can be played.
Mr Jobs said this week that Digital Rights Management systems had not ended piracy and so should be removed.
In an open letter, the Apple boss added that removing such software would also allow greater usability for customers, as any online music store would be able to sell songs that would work on all players.
Yet Warner Music, the world's fourth largest record company, is far from convinced.
It is home to artists including Madonna and Green Day.
The contraction was much worse than had been expected and was the biggest three-month decline in GDP since the third quarter of 1979.
"It's the weakest in 30 years - that's extremely soft," said George Buckley at Deutsche Bank.
GDP measures the value of all the goods and services produced by a country.
Taken together, it was the worst six-month decline in GDP since the ONS began publishing the figures.
The latest figures mean that GDP has now shrunk for three quarters in a row, and confirm that the economy is still deep in recession.
Analysts suggested that this would be the worst contraction in the current recession.
"I very much doubt that GDP is going to contract at these sort of rates for any longer, but I do think it will still contract all throughout 2009," said George Buckley at Deutsche Bank.
"A contraction of at least 4% is much more likely," said Benjamin Williamson at the Centre for Economic and Business Research.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper said the government stood by its forecasts.
"We believe the economy will start to recover towards the end of this year," she told the BBC.
Alistair Darling had also predicted that GDP in the first three months of the year would be at a similar level to that seen in the previous quarter.
The ONS cautioned that the GDP figure was only its preliminary estimate and could be revised.
There was some better news for the economy in the latest retail sales figures.
Gubbay - often credited with increasing opera's popularity - accused the current management of "paternalistic, clubbie arrogance".
His outburst came on Tuesday following news that his application to run the world famous venue - home to both the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet - had been rejected.
The former chief executive Michael Kaiser left earlier this year to become president of the John F Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington.
In his time at the Opera House, Kaiser saw it through a troubled �214m refurbishment, a change of image and secured extra funding.
However, the ROH has continued to court controversy in recent months over the high-price of tickets - and internal failings such as poor visibility and acoustics.
In his application to run the Opera House, Gubbay proposed a 12-point action plan for his company to improve the finances and accessibility of the prestigious venue.
But the ROH board rejected the application on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a company to be in charge.
In response, Gubbay wrote a bitter letter to ROH chairman Sir Colin Southgate, accusing his board of having a predetermined agenda.
"We can only assume that it already has in mind somebody who is prepared to work as a toady to the chairman, continuing the 19th century tradition of paternalistic, clubbie arrogance into the 21st century," said Gubbay.
He added that the ROH maintained its reputation for elitism despite public interest in becoming more involved and their indirect financial contributions through taxes and the National Lottery.
In response, the board said it was an equal opportunities employer and weighed up applications for advertised jobs against carefully drawn-up criteria.
It added that it could not comment on specific applications for jobs which were "a matter of confidence between the applicant and the selection committee".
However, the board also said it would welcome apersonal application from Gubbay rather than a corporate one.
He told the German business daily Handelsblatt that the French and German governments should discuss the matter.
Germany's Siemens has a 34% stake in a subsidiary of French atomic firm Areva.
President Sarkozy clinched the deal on a visit to Tripoli on Wednesday, during which he held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
The nuclear energy project is aimed at turning sea water into clean drinking water.
Mr Gaddafi gave up Libya's nuclear weapons programme in 2003, ending decades of international isolation.
Mr Sarkozy's deal was condemned by other German politicians, including Greens leader Reinhard Buetikofer, who called it "highly questionable in security policy terms".
He accused Mr Sarkozy of "reckless, nationalistic activism".
A senior Social Democrat (SPD) deputy, Ulrich Kelber, said Mr Sarkozy's Libya trip was "all about show and the primitive pursuit of his own interests".
The Gaddafi-Sarkozy meeting was seen as a sign of the normalisation of ties between Libya and the EU following the release of six Bulgarian medics, who had been jailed in Libya for more than eight years, accused of deliberately infecting 438 children with HIV-tainted blood.
The EU and the United States had made it clear to Mr Gaddafi that resolving the medics' situation was key to improving relations.
The National Radiological Protection Board's investigation has reviewed recent evidence including a study of 3,000 children in the US, Europe and New Zealand, published late last year, which suggested that pylons could double the risk of childhood leukaemia.
The NRPB's study, chaired by respected scientist Sir Richard Doll, is likely to conclude on Tuesday that the increased danger is slight as the ordinary risk is only one in 20,000 children.
It will insist that evidence is weak but will call for further detailed research to explain "anomalous" studies.
If this is correct, it would represent a shift by the NRPB, which last year interpreted the biggest-ever study of childhood cancer and electromagnetic fields as evidence against a link.
More than 23,000 homes in the UK are situated near power lines and it has previously been suggested by campaigners that the electromagnetic field surrounding the cables can trigger leukaemia.
Opponents are calling for a mandatory 50m "buffer zone" each side of the lines.
In the US, legislation prevents new homes being built near power lines.
But some opponents say that "hissing" cables, known as the corona effect, can extend the risk several hundred metres from power lines.
Some UK parents have engaged lawyers over the issue but studies have mainly been inconclusive.
A study by Bristol University scientists in 1999 identified a "causal" link between pylons and leukaemia.
But a number of other studies, including one involving Canadian children, have failed to prove a link and the Electricity Association has denied a connection.
Professor Colin Blakemore, an expert in electromagnetic fields from Oxford University, told the BBC that the risk from power lines only accounted for approximately 20% of the homes where electromagnetic fields were high.
He said that the extra risk from powerlines amounted to one additional case of childhood leukaemia every two years in the UK.
Professor Denis Henshaw, from Bristol, whose has carried out research into how electromagnetic fields might be able to affect health said that the evidence was now strong.
"The implications are obviously enormous, and to be fair, the scientific datahas been conflicting but I think we are in a situation now where I think thestudies are all pointing in the same direction.
Campaigner Maureen Asbury said that she would continue to press for more precautions against electromagnetic fields.
James Rodgers has travelled there to film this report.

Julia spoke to some mums with their new born babies at Derby City to find out what they think.
And we'll be returning to Derby City in the coming months to look at some of the other key issues dominating the NHS.
Derby Hospitals NHS Trust runs four hospitals in South Derbyshire, including the City's General Hospital, Royal Infirmary and children's hospital.
The Derby Hospitals Trusts employ 7,000 staff, from doctors to porters - to cover a population of around 600,000 people.
The new PFI hospital is planned to have 35 operating theatres and well over 1,000 acute beds, when it opens in around 2008.
Nasa scientists say the ice around the coast of Greenland is still thinning fast, by more than one metre (three feet) annually.
At a conservative estimate, they say, the entire ice sheet is undergoing a net loss of about 51 cubic kilometres of ice each year.
But while most coastal areas are now experiencing significant thinning, some inland parts of the sheet show slight ice thickening.
Now, for the first time, parts of the sheet have been mapped accurately enough to detect significant changes in elevation.
"It is about 4% of what we expect over the course of this century - somewhere between four and 10 cm a decade.
"What may prove a more important consequence than the rise in sea level is the reduction in albedo, the reflectivity of the ice.
Melita Norwood was the daughter of a Latvian father and English mother, and had a sister and half-brother.
Her spying career began four years after Joseph Stalin had seized power, long before his atrocities had become known to the outside world.
The great-grandmother of 87 still lives in the same, spartan south London house which she bought with her husband, a maths teacher, 50 years ago.
Two citations to her late husband, Hilary, for his work in the trade union movement as a member of the National Union of Teachers, are proudly displayed.
She had been working for five years in the general office of the British Non Ferrous Metals Research Association in Euston, North London when her career in espionage first began.
By the time she agreed to work for the KGB, she had been promoted and was personal assistant to the director.
As a highly trusted employee, sensitive documents crossed her desk each day.
But the unremarkable but highly intelligent office worker would pass those secrets to Moscow via clandestine meetings with Russian agents.
Still, she refuses to discuss the actual passing over of documents and refuses to say who wooed her to the KGB.
The last time she visited Russia was in 1979, with her husband, when she says she again rejected financial reward.
She has one daughter who works in a school laboratory, two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
From Monday children under 12 and less than 4ft 5in (135cm) tall have to use a car seat or the driver faces fines from �30 on-the-spot or up to �500 in court.
Some youngsters who have spent years using adult seats will now need to revert to using special child seats.
Safety groups have welcomed the move, which the government says will prevent 2,000 child injuries every year.
Children less than five feet tall and using adult seats risk injury or slipping out of their seat belts in the event of a crash.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa) believes this is the next step in improving the safety of children in cars.
In a car travelling at 30 mph, children who are not correctly restrained in the back seats are thrown forward with a force that is 30 to 60 times its body weight, says Rospa.
Manufacturers are said to be working round the clock to meet the demand for new car seats.
Halfords has sold double the volume over the last two months compared to the same time last year, while supermarket chain Asda reported a 387% year-on-year surge of all types of car seats.
Tesco said sales of its booster seats - which are suitable for bigger children - were up 1,000% this week, compared to the same time last year.
But there have been concerns that parents have not been properly informed about the new laws, and many will have got rid of their child booster seats years ago.
Exemptions do apply, such as if the car is not big enough to accommodate three seats across the back, then two will be sufficient.
Police in South Yorkshire have been running awareness days to make sure drivers know about the new legislation.
"Initially it will be a softly, softly approach in South Yorkshire with prosecutions following where appropriate," PC John Scruby told BBC News.

The venue, which will also host six Paralympic events, is on the site of the old Athens international airport eight kilometres south of the centre.
It was among the projects facing serious delays after complaints from local residents held up construction.
But test events have been held and all venues are due to be open by 12 August.
The arena should seat over 13,000 spectators, and will also host the wheelchair rugby tournament during the Paralympics.
It will also be used for the Paralympic volleyball and wheelchair fencing tournaments.
It was the first venue in the Helliniko complex to be completed and the main stadium has a capacity of 8,300 seats, with a smaller arena holding 2,000 seats.
The EU said there had been a gross violation of human rights when troops opened fire on protesters last month.
The demonstrators were angry at rumours that Capt Moussa Dadis Camara, who took power in a coup last December, intended to stand for president next year.
Earlier this month the EU's development chief Karel de Gucht said the coup leader should be put on trial for crimes against humanity.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has opened an investigation into the deaths and a UN inquiry is also under way.
West Africa's regional economic body Ecowas has already imposed an arms embargo on Guinea over the killings.
EU foreign ministers agreed on the sanctions for Capt Camara and his ruling Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD) at a meeting in Luxembourg.
The sanctions are to target "members of the CNDD and individual associated with them, responsible for the violent crackdown or the political stalemate", an EU statement said.
Guinea's previous government was overthrown in a bloodless coup last December after the death of Lansana Conte, who had ruled the country since 1984.
The 8,500-strong archive collected by industrialist Howard Gilman "helped define" the history of photography.
It includes some of the most iconic and classic works from the 19th century and early 20th century.
"It's been the dream of the Met to acquire it," he added.
"It has things that were already the textbook examples from the history of photography but at the same time it helped define that history,"
The archive includes photographs from the 1860s British portraitist Julia Margaret Cameron and Roger Fenton, best known for his Crimean War pictures.
It also features American Civil War pictures by Mathew Brady, Alexander Gardner and Timothy O'Sullivan, as well as work by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Man Ray.
The collection was put together between 1977 and 1997 by Gilman, the chairman of the Gilman Paper Company, who together with his curator Pierre Apraxine sought out iconic and classic works.
Daniel said the foundation that owned the collection had made a partial gift of it to the museum, but did not reveal how much the museum had paid for the rest.
Around 20 pictures from the collection would go on display on 17 April, said Daniel.
"Every exhibition we do from now on will always have the Gilman collection because it becomes the essential core of the Met's collection," he added.
Ms Rice briefed the king on her joint meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday.
The Jerusalem summit ended without any significant progress.
In Amman, Ms Rice also met security officials from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
Ms Rice said on Monday she hoped that Arab states understood they had a role to play in encouraging the peace process.
On Wednesday, she is to hold talks in Berlin with other members of the Quartet group of Middle East mediators.

The finding comes from what they say is the most comprehensive set of weather measurements ever made during such an event.
The 11 August, 1999, total eclipse, visible over Britain, the rest of Europe and the Middle East, also produced detectable atmospheric pressure fluctuations.
The effects tracked the shadow of the Moon as it raced over the Earth, covering a region of the planet's surface several thousand kilometres across.
The August 1999 event aroused unprecedented interest in Europe and the Middle East from the public and scientists alike.
Dr Karen Aplin, from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford, and Dr Giles Harrison, from the University of Reading, placed accurate weather recording equipment in the path of the eclipse, and compared its recordings with data collected at Reading, which was slightly to one side of the path of totality.
"The meteorological effects of eclipses are not well understood and high quality data are unusual," Dr Aplin told BBC News Online.
"We hoped to investigate the controversy over whether there is such a thing as an eclipse wind, which is often anecdotally reported," she added.
According to the scientists, their measurements are the first accurate recordings of the weather changes during an eclipse.
Wind patterns were subtly altered over a region several thousand km across by the cooling induced when the Sun's rays were blocked out.
In particular, the researchers found that a gentle "cold-cored cyclone" was induced at Reading during the eclipse because of the prevailing cloudy conditions coupled with the slight temperature change.
A cold-cored cyclone is a roughly circular pattern of winds with air at the centre sinking to feed the outward flow.
"We found that the prevailing weather conditions were disturbed even in the cloudy area, and we found a wind circulation which moved with the Moon's shadow," says Dr Apiln.
"After the eclipse had passed the wind patterns returned to their pre-eclipse values.
While the researchers say the cold-cored cyclone model is a good one to explain what they observed, they add that it does not fully explain the wind patterns seen along the boundary between the region of the total and partial eclipse.
The research is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
One of them proposes setting up a National Investigation Agency with sweeping powers of investigation.

Ken Livingstone said it was "really outrageous" that they had refused to pay the �8-a-day charge since July.
The US is claiming diplomatic immunity under the 1961 Vienna Convention, which gives protection against paying taxes, and says several embassies do not pay.
But Mr Livingstone said it was a charge for a service, not a tax, and vowed to take them to court to make them pay.
"When British troops are putting their lives on the line for American foreign policy, it would be quite nice if they paid the congestion charge.
Rick Roberts, of the US embassy, said local London staff paid the charge, but accredited embassy officials do not.
He said he believed other embassies also refused to pay, and said it had nothing to do with the arrival of new ambassador, Robert Tuttle.
"Everyone paid it while we were discussing the matter prior to July 2005 but talks were getting nowhere and we took unilateral action," he said.
"We've made our position clear - this is a congestion tax.

In 1948, Stalin cut off all land links into West Berlin in an attempt to force out British, French and US troops.
Seventy-eight aircrew died in plane crashes during the operation.
Thousands of people, including dozens of American, British and French veterans, attended ceremonies at Berlin's recently closed Tempelhof Airport on Tuesday to pay tributes to those involved in the unprecedented effort.
Representatives from the countries that took part earlier laid wreaths at the base of the memorial for those who died in front of the terminal building as a German military band played sombre music.
"I would like to express the Berliners' sincere thanks today to the representatives of the Allies and the veterans," Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit said.
"We will never forget the victims who fell for the freedom of our city," he added.
As a grand finale for the anniversary events, 700 tiny parachutes holding sweets were dropped over the airport, repeating something the Western pilots did to keep German youngsters' spirits up.
The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in the German capital says that at the end of World War II, West Berlin was a tiny outpost of the Western Allies in Soviet-controlled eastern Germany.
To Stalin, it was a blot on his landscape and one he was determined to remove, our correspondent says.
So in 1948, the late Soviet leader cut all road, rail and river links into West Berlin in an effort to starve its residents into submitting to Soviet forces and to pressure the British, American and French troops into withdrawing.
But the Allies launched the biggest airlift in history, bringing food and fuel and machinery, to keep the West Berliners from starving.
Horst Simon, who was six years old at the time of the blockade, told the BBC that he remembered how West Berliners were praying for the airlift to succeed.
"The West Berliners had the hope that the Russians are not coming to West Berlin, and so I think that the West Berliners at this time had the hope that the Allies can help us," he said.
Stalin officially ended the blockade on 12 May 1949, although flights continued until that November to ensure the city was well stocked in case of further blockades.

The weight of a second head attached to her own was preventing Manar from sitting or crawling.
Another paediatrician of the 13-strong team said he expected her to remain in intensive care for at least a week.
Doctors have also said the girl can move her limbs and does not show signs of paralysis, but refused to give more details of her recovery.
They said they had been instructed to do so by the Egyptian presidency and the baby's father.
A similar operation was carried out on a girl in the Dominican Republic last year, but the child did not survive.
As the delegates at the Afghan peace conference try to work towards a settlement, there is much talk of plans for the international community to reconstruct and develop the country.
It used to be widely admired across the region, but was largely destroyed in fighting and then suffered a range of restrictions during the time of the Taleban.
The university has been shut since the American-led coalition's assault on Afghanistan began, but even when it reopens, it will be barely able to function.
Kabul University was once one of the finest places of learning in Asia.
Nearly a thousand lecturers and professors taught in a range of faculties that had links with academic institutions all around the world.
But as Kabul was engulfed in fighting during the early nineties, the campus became a battlefield.
As factions of what is now the Northern Alliance fought from building to building, the university was destroyed.
Laboratories, dormitories and the library were all completely looted.
As the institution struggled to rebuild, the Taleban took over.
Women were banned from the campus, there were a range of intellectual restrictions and professors were purged.
The campus also went without water or electricity for several years and the most basic materials are still completely lacking.
Two thirds of the staff at the education faculty have gone, and those that remain are completely demoralised.
They work from books that are decades out of date.
They only earn a few dollars a month, and anyway, they have not been paid since April.
Many are living on nothing more than bread and tea.
Before the war, nearly all the education faculty professors had been able to spend periods studying abroad.
But now, the department could not even afford to send them down the road to the nearby Afghan city of Jalalabad.
The faculty members feel utterly isolated from the rest of the academic world and hopelessly out of touch with the current of modern ideas.
But even more seriously, the education faculty, which aims to produce teachers, is desperately short of students.
Afghanistan's school system has been so shattered by the war that very few young people are emerging from it with the ability and the money to go on to university.
With the Taleban gone, the academic climate will now be freer.
Women are able to return to the campus, and the few who are already wandering through the university's gardens are obviously delighted to be back.
They talk excitedly of the chance to study and of hopes for the future.
But if their dreams are to be realised, the international community will have to invest heavily in a major rescue plan for Kabul University.
Two bogus police officers bundle him into the back seat of another car, where he is handcuffed and driven away at speed towards Tonbridge, with a gun to his head.
They tell Mrs Dixon her husband has been in a car crash and that they will take her to the hospital.
The Dixon family ask for blankets but none arrive and they endure hours in freezing conditions.
Other robbers enter the depot with guns and tie up 14 terrified depot workers, forcing them to lie or crouch on the floor.
Another �153m has to be left behind because there is no room left in the vehicle.
The first of the gang members drive away in the lorry, warning the captives "We know where you live", and returns to Elderden Farm, where the money is to be divided up.
The captives, some barely believing they are still alive, do nothing for some time.
Britain's 27 World Heritage Sites, including the Tower of London, are not formally protected by planning laws.
But the government is now proposing to put buffer zones around them, in an attempt to prevent the tower being put on a UN blacklist of endangered sites.
In a separate move, Westminster City Council is urging the UN to protect the Palace of Westminster.
Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell wants to change planning laws to give heritage sites similar development protections to those currently given to areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks.
Britain's World Heritage sites include Durham Cathedral, Stonehenge, Edinburgh's Old and New Towns and Hadrian's Wall.
Unesco, the UN's cultural organisation, has already warned that plans for skyscrapers near the Tower of London could put it on its "in danger" list.
It is due to make its ruling in June.
Meanwhile Westminster City Council has formally appealed to Unesco to protect the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey, which are part of a World Heritage Site.
The council is concerned that London Mayor Ken Livingstone will use new planning powers to approve plans for more skyscrapers in the vicinity.
At present he can only reject, rather than approve, major developments.
That will change with the introduction of the Greater London Authority Bill 2006, currently making its way through Parliament.
Mr Livingstone will be given complete control over approving as well as refusing "strategic" applications.
The council is particularly concerned about plans for a cluster of buildings around nearby Waterloo Station.

Ms Swinson has called for a ban on airbrushed photo advertisements designed for under-16s while those aimed at adults should be clearly flagged up.
Ms Swinson believes that altered images put too much pressure on women and children who strive to achieve a "perfect" body image which is unattainable in real life.
The Liberal Democrats have put forward proposals protecting women and girls from pressure about weight and image and promoting healthy eating.
With Table Mountain as its backdrop, Newlands is one of the most spectacular sporting venues in the world.
The 25,000-seat stadium has hosted international cricket for 118 years and produced many a memorable outcome, with very few Tests drawn there.
With spinners and pacemen getting joy out of the track, high scores have proved difficult to come by in one-day internationals, with only 11 totals in excess of 250 recorded in 30 games.
England will play their two group games against Zimbabwe and Australia there, while the ground will also host the first semi-final.
Kingsmead has been the scene of many a dramatic game and thunderstorm in the 84 years it has hosted top-level cricket.
Located on the east coast of South Africa, the humidity provides plenty of help for the pacemen, with India's Ashish Nehra famously ripping through England here under the lights in the 2003 World Cup.
In that same tournament Canada's Austin Coddrington took 5-27 as they stunned Bangladesh.
Seating 25,000, the venue will host its share of group matches as well as the second semi-final.
A good hunting ground for batsmen in recent years, it produced an astonishing ODI in March 2006, when the Proteas made a world-record 438-9 to overhaul Australia's 434-4 and Aussie seamer Mick Lewis conceded 113 runs in 10 overs.
The venue for this tournament's final was also the place where Michael Atherton famously batted for 10 hours to save a Test for England in 1995.
Stephen Pearson gave them an early lead with a tap-in and Chris Sutton made it two from close range.
Livingston gave themselves a glimmer of hope before half-time when Derek Lilley fired low past Rab Douglas.
But Alan Thompson curled an effort into the net just after the break before Henrik Larsson rifled in a fourth and Thompson scored from the penalty spot.
John Kennedy then came to the rescue of the home side in the 11th minute with alast-gasp tackle on Fernando Pasquinelli after Burton O'Brien had played him through in the box.
But the Celtic nerves were eased a minute later when they took the lead,albeit with a hint of offside.
Stanislav Varga exchanged passes with Sutton and had time to look up androll the ball across the face of goal to present Pearson with the easiest of tap-ins.
Andrews should have done better in the 15th minute when he rose above the Celtic defence to head O'Brien's corner wide.
Varga gifted Livingston a glorious chance for the equaliser five minutes later when he was caught in possession by David McNamee before Stuart Lovell rolled the ball into the path of Lilley.
However, Lilley shot straight at Douglas from point-blank range.
Roddy McKenzie saved Lovell's blushes after 24 minutes by stretching to divert his mis-hit back-pass around the post.
The Celtic defence, however, let Livingston back in the game with some terrible defending in the 41st minute and Lilley capitalised to fire low past Douglas.
It took Celtic just three minutes of the second half to re-establish their two-goal lead.
Thompson cut in from the left flank and exchanged passes with Sutton beforecoolly curling a right-footed effort past the despairing hand of McKenzie andinto the corner.
Celtic wrapped up the three points in the 55th minute when McKenzie waspenalised for picking up Manu Dorado's backpass and Larsson smashed a right-footshot home.
The pressure from the home side was relentless and Sutton headed Thompson'scorner on to the top of the net, Neil Lennon had a shot saved and Pearson should have scored his second.
With 10 minutes remaining, Celtic sub Craig Beattie was shoved over in the penalty area by Andrews and Thompson coolly chipped the spot-kick into the centre of the net as McKenzie dived to his left.
The league has given the club a six-figure advance of money due to them at the end of the current campaign.
The club's administrator told the SPL they are confident the club can fulfil their remaining fixtures.
David Elliot gave the assurances at a meeting requested by league bosses at Hampden Park on Thursday.
The Black and Whites went into administration last week, and it emerged the playing staff were owed at least two-weeks' wages.
The SPL money will include backpay for the players, and allow the club to stay afloat at least until the end of the season.
A spokesman for the league was pleased with the outcome of the summit at the National Stadium.
Earlier on Thursday, Fifa gave players dispensation to sign for other clubs until the end of March.
The league money will now make sure the players receive payment until their 38 league matches have been played.
Last Saturday, caretaker manager Mick Wadsworth had to draft in a number of U19 players in order to put out a full team against Aberdeen.
Some regular starters decided not to play because of concerns over the unpaid wages and medical insurance.
The club had previously said that a large crowd at Sunday's league match with Celtic at Almondvale was critical to their short-term survival.
However, a club spokesman thought that even a big turnout at Livingston on Sunday may not be enough to save the club.
"Celtic are our only real chance of making money before the split," he said.
Gretna are still looking for a new financial backer to replace Brooks Mileson, who withdrew his funding last week.
An Irish takeover consortium lead by former Carlisle manager Roddy Collins met with administrators on Tuesday.
While a Scottish group headed by businessman Paul Davies was due to have their meeting at the club on Thursday.
In the last year, Zimbabwe's embattled independent press has survived intimidation, arrests and even arson.
But human rights groups and journalists warn that the Zimbabwean Government plans to silence the independent media once and for all.
The government has introduced new legislation to ban critical reporting of President Mugabe and his ruling Zanu-PF party in the run-up to presidential elections next March.
The move follows expulsions of foreign news organizations and government accusations that independent and foreign journalists are in league with opposition groups.
In November, an anonymous government spokesman, quoted in the state-owned Herald newspaper, accused journalists who reported on an attack by ruling party militants against whites and opposition officials of aiding the "terrorist" opposition.
As part of its re-election strategy, Zanu-PF is pushing for a 24-hour news radio station, a TV station, eight provincial newspapers and a news agency under a new government media house called New Ziana.
Earlier this year, the government passed legislation effectively banning independent radio stations.
Rural areas have been particularly affected, as radio is the main medium for receiving news there.
To fill this vacuum, a new radio station started broadcasting to Zimbabwe via short-wave and the Internet on 19 December.
Broadcasting each evening in English, SW Radio Africa, says it is independent of any political parties and will provide unbiased news and current affairs programmes.
Until now, the only local airtime available to Mugabe's election rival Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), is on Voice of the People, which broadcasts on short-wave from the island of Madagascar.
But most people in rural areas still rely on FM and medium-wave radios and television, where the state retains a monopoly.
Proposed regulations will place further restrictions on independent journalists.
The Public Order and Security Bill, which bans political rallies and bars newspapers from publishing articles criticizing the president, has also been put to parliament.
Another law banning foreign journalists from working in Zimbabwe is expected to be passed soon.
The proposed Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Bill disqualifies foreigners from working as journalists, even for foreign media.
Those found guilty of violating the bill will have to pay a fine of up to 100,000 Zimbabwe dollars ($1,875) or be sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
Zimbabwe Union of Journalists secretary-general Basildon Peta warns that the bill is "the final nail in the coffin of the media".
Zimbabwe's most popular newspaper, the independent Daily News, has been the main target.
Its printing press was destroyed in a bomb attack in January, although it continues to publish.
Editor Geoff Nyarota was arrested twice, but charges were quickly dropped.
The authorities expelled three foreign correspondents, and in July barred BBC reporters from the country.
The US Congress has recently passed the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Bill which offers financial incentives to Zimbabwe to allow fair elections and support a free and independent press.
Mr Mugabe reacted by calling the bill "repugnant, provocative, and indeed a gross violation of international law".
Allied Irish has confirmed these deals involved buying and selling Japanese yen and US dollars.
These were both "spot" contracts, involving on-the-spot deals and "forwards", which are agreements to purchase foreign exchange at a specified date in the future at a specified exchange rate.
These give the holder the option to buy or sell a specified quantity of a commodity, currency or security - in this case a currency - at a specified date at a specified price.
AIB is describing them as "fictitious".
This act or acts appears to be the fraud at the heart of the case.
It remains unclear why the options contracts were not bought.
Another theory is that an individual or individuals skimmed the fees that appeared to have been paid for options, instead taking them.
The move is likely to have been needed to revive interest as stock exchanges around the world come under pressure.
The new range is $85-95 a share - a reduction of about a quarter from the previous level of $108-135, which valued the company at $36bn (�19bn).
With the rewards set to be less, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are selling a smaller part of their stake.
"They recognised that there wasn't the appetite for shares," said Hilary Cook, an analyst at Barclays stockbrokers in London.
The planned flotation, watched with keen interest around the globe, already has encountered some problems.
It has been delayed for at least a day as paperwork required for its shares to be sold has yet to be approved by regulators.
Google hopes to get the go ahead and close the auction at 2000 GMT on Wednesday.
The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) gave no reason for the previous day's delay to the IPO.
Once the SEC gives its approval, Google will stop accepting bids for its shares and could start issuing stock within a matter of hours.
The lower price, however, means the number of shares being sold also has been cut.
Among those offloading a portion of their stock are Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, a number of other company executives and the venture capital firms which helped fund the company's expansion.
The SEC approval will mean the "Dutch auction" under way to set the price of the Google shares will come to an end.
The auction is designed to give small investors a better chance of getting their hands on the shares that have been made available.
Potential buyers are asked to specify both the price they are willing to pay, and the number of shares they want.
The lowest successful bid then becomes the issue price, and the flotation can begin.
Google will trade on the technology-heavy Nasdaq exchange.
The company does, however, have a couple of clouds on its horizon.
Google revealed on Monday that the US stock market watchdog had launched an informal inquiry into its failure to register shares given to employees.
The company may face fines if the SEC finds that the share issue was contrary to stock market regulations.
Google has offered to buy back the shares, but at a lower price than they are expected to reach when traded on the stock market.
The government approved the nationalisation of the carrier and its subsidiary Austral on Thursday.
The airline, which was owned by Spanish firm Grupo Marsans, had build up debts of $900m (�505m).
It is the latest big firm to be brought back under state ownership after a wave of privatisations in the 1990s.
The nationalisation of Argentina's flag-carrier ends a long-running saga in the country.
The deal, announced in July with great fanfare by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, was welcomed by Argentines fed up with delays and cancellations.
Aerolineas is overstaffed, heavily unionised and more than half its ageing fleet of 67 planes are grounded.
But critics said the government has failed to resolve serious financial and labour woes before taking over the company.
The January 2003 exhibition called "Caution! Religion" was staged by the Sakharov Museum, named after the Soviet-era dissident Andrei Sakharov.
The Russian Orthodox Church had condemned director Yuri Samodurov and his colleague Lyudmila Vasilovskaya.
The court ruling said the show was "openly insulting and blasphemous".
It featured an icon with a hole instead of a head, where visitors could show their faces.
There was also a sculpture of a church made from vodka bottles.
Vandals defaced the exhibits just days after they went on display, but charges against them were later dropped.
His supporters said it also highlighted the growing power and influence of the Orthodox Church in Russia - constitutionally a secular state.
A third defendant, an artist who contributed to the show, was acquitted.
Lawyers for the other defendants vowed to appeal against the verdicts - if necessary to the European Court of Human Rights.
The killing of riot police chief Rajah Abu Lehiya took place on Monday morning as the Gaza Strip was in uproar following a major Israeli incursion into the Palestinian-controlled town of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
The group has distanced itself from Monday's killing, which was claimed by a relative of one of the Hamas members killed at the rally.
Police said Abu Lehiya's car was stopped by 20 armed men dressed in the uniform of the intelligence forces as he drove through central Gaza on Monday morning.
When the car stopped, a large group of the uniformed men surrounded the car, kidnapped Abu Lehiya and drove him off to a Hamas-controlled neighbourhood.
Police said Imad Akel, a brother of one of those who died at the 8 October 2001 rally, appeared before a crowd of residents in Nusseirat and declared he had taken revenge for his brother's death.
Hamas official Abdel Aziz Rantisi distanced the group from the killing, saying it was a question of "family revenge" involving the Akel clan.
In the hours after the killing, clashes erupted in central Gaza City between the police, Hamas gunmen and other Palestinians who began throwing stones at the police when they tried to arrest suspects.
A BBC correspondent in central Gaza says gunfire continued intermittently following the incident although it was not clear who was shooting at whom.
The killing of Palestinian officers by militants is rare, but correspondents say there is a now a real possibility of confrontation between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
A police statement said the aim of Abu Lehiya's killers was to "spread tension and conspiracies" in the midst of the ongoing Israeli occupation.
Hamas has been behind the most deadly suicide bombings against Israel during the two-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in defiance of the PA's declared policy not to attack civilians.
Here, an anonymous 31-year-old police officer in Hawija, near Tikrit, describes the changes he has witnessed in 13 years on the force.
I graduated as an investigation officer and now I'm a first lieutenant with the Iraq police force.
Because of the circumstances the country is in right now, the range of my work is much wider.
I have to fight terrorism and deal with the chaos by de-fusing roadside bombs and improvised devices.
In the past my duty was just to enforce the rule of Iraqi law - mainly by investigating local crime.
I do this job first and foremost because I love it.
I also do it because if I were to quit and if my colleagues were to quit too, this country would face complete disaster.
There are some big challenges ahead of us, but we should be able to overcome them.
So people lost trust in authority and did not distinguish between us, the Iraqi police and the occupying forces.
But now people are beginning to regain their trust in the police force in particular because we are in direct contact with people, unlike the army who deal with the foreign forces more.
New police officers lack experience and knowledge of the job.
During patrols my convoy has come under attack many times from armed men especially during election time.
Five of my colleagues were killed and about 10 others were injured - some of them critically, so they had to quit their jobs.
My family does not tell me to leave the police force, but they do tell me to be careful.
Labour's Caroline Flint, Tory David David and LibDem Charles Kennedy on the TV debate between the candidates to be the next Chancellor.
Tony Blair has branded people opposed to his public service reform as "wreckers", but has been reluctant to name names.
His spokesman has insisted he was talking about the Tories and anyone opposed to investment or reform in the services.
And suggestions he was only talking about conservatives - both large and small c varieties - has not cooled their anger.
Thanks to his spin doctors and even some of his ministers, it is possible to get an idea of who exactly the government really believes is standing in its way.
Next on the blacklist, according to Home Secretary David Blunkett, are the vested interests of the Metropolitan police federation and the prison officers' union.
The prime minister has made it crystal clear he is furious with the RMT and its leader Vernon Hince for striking over pay.
And his deputy John Prescott was happy to attack GMB leader John Edmonds, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the proposals claiming they could become Labour's poll tax.
Spin doctors have also targeted Unisons' Dave Prentis and even TUC general secretary John Monks.
The prime minister also referred to those on the "far left" who, he claimed, ended up agreeing with the Tories in their attacks on government policy.
This displayed a previously unnoticed concern that the old hard left activists were once again exerting an influence - although it is difficult to see where.
Finally, and inevitably, it is sections of the media which, according to the prime minister and his spokesmen, keep stirring up trouble by interpreting his remarks in a way he did not intend.
Residents in Seedhill said they were assured housing would not be built on the community resource after they saw tests being carried out on soil.
The local authority denied lying and said the whole area would be developed.
Resident George Elliot was among residents who wrote to the council to ask if there was a proposed development.
He said he received a letter of assurance that only pitches would be upgraded.
"Later on, through freedom of information, we secured plans that showed they had plans drawn up for houses to be built on these pitches," he said.
A council report shows dangerous levels of toxic waste and gases under the soils.
The council has denied misleading people and said any property developer would treat the area to prevent any risk to public safety.
A council spokesman said a maximum of 20 units are planned for the area surrounding the pitches, which will part-fund upgrading.
"To my knowledge they did say the development was going to take place.
Concorde is inextricably linked to its spiritual home of Filton, where the supersonic aircraft was manufactured in Britain.
In the 1960s Brian Trubshaw test flew the first British jet at the airfield in South Gloucestershire and the very last Concorde off the production line came from Filton.
This archive documentary tells the story of the last Concorde, which eventually came home to Bristol in 2003.
Mr Wilkie was killed when a block of concrete was thrown down on his car from a bridge as he drove a miner to work in South Wales.
There were emotional scenes at Cardiff Crown Court as Dean Hancock and Russell Shankland, both 21, were sentenced after the jury had deliberated for nearly seven hours.
His girlfriend, Carol Hopkins, fainted and collapsed and was carried out from the courtroom.
During the trial the jury had heard that in the early hours of 30 November 1984, Shankland and Hancock had planned to disrupt a police escort and taxi taking miner David Williams to the Merthyr Vale pit.
They hurled a 46lb concrete block and a concrete post weighing 65lbs from a bridge over the Head of the Valleys Rd at Rhymner.
Mr Wilkie leaves behind four children, the youngest of whom was born two months after his death.
After the verdicts, Shankland's lawyer John Prosser QC said that his clients were victims in "a nation at war".
Political leaders united in condemning the killing - Labour's Neil Kinnock called it an "atrocity" and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was "an utterly despicable deed".
But the Left regarded the sentencing as too harsh, a statement of victory over the miners rather than an act of justice.
On appeal, the convictions were reduced to manslaughter and sentences reduced to eight years.
After a fierce campaign for their release led by the NUM's Arthur Scargill and Labour MP Tony Benn, the men were released on 30 November 1989 - the fifth anniversary of David Wilkie's death.
Ferguson confirms Rooney rumours in dramatic media conference
The raids are part of an investigation into an alleged fraud designed to hide the cult's ownership of property.
Cult members were responsible for a nerve gas attack on the Tokyo underground rail network three years ago, which killed 12 people and made 6,000 others ill.
Public fears resulting from that and other incidents means that the cult now has to carry out its business dealings under false pretences.
The cult is said to have used fake signature seals to cover up its purchase of properties, including a holiday house which was to be used as a dormitory for cult members.
The police arrested an estate agent whom they suspect of placing fraudulent construction orders.
Mr Asahara is still on trial on charges relating to the Tokyo gas attack and other similar cases.
The news comes after a survey showed first-time buyers were priced out of the market in 92% of UK towns, BBC News spoke to two would-be home owners about their attempts to get on the property ladder.
I started working in the university in August 2003 and my contract was for three years, but I was expecting to stay three or four years more than that.
We were paying rent of �600 so we thought about buying.
I started going into estate agents to ask how they did things here - with two salaries we were expecting to buy at least a small flat.
We both work in the city and we were looking for something accessible - something we could at least bike to.
But from the beginning we realised that any small flat near the city centre would cost at least �150,000.
But the most we could afford with the mortgages available would be a flat of about �120,000, with rates of about 6%.
Something I found quite strange here was that you don't have fixed rate mortgages - they are fixed for about one year only.
To buy a moderately sized house you would need to save �50,000 just to start.
When I realised I couldn't find anything close to Cambridge I decided to look at buying something in Spain that I could rent out.
Most banks offer mortgages which depend on the amount capital you have and the amount you can afford to pay each month.
I'm paying rent here and paying my mortgage with the savings I have each month - and I know if I go back to Spain I'll have a house waiting for me there.
I don't really know that the government should make it easier for people to buy their first home or if it's something that the banks or estate agents could make easier.
I guess I would increase the amount of money they would give for a mortgage to four or five times your annual salary.
Both my wife and I work full-time and have fairly decent earnings coming in.
On that, the best you can afford is a studio shoe box flat or something away from your friends and family in an undesirable part of town.
I'm sure a lot of first-time buyers are in a similar situation to us.
If you've got no-one getting on the ladder at the bottom then the market is going to stagnate.
The government have been very keen to brag about how they've had record low interest rates but they're ignoring the fact that our housing is very unaffordable.
It's been caused by fact that people have been able to borrow four or five times their salary.
If rates creep up then people are going to suddenly realise that they've borrowed a figure that's above their station and that's when repossessions will come in.
We're in a situation where we just rent with a family member - it's cheaper than the market rate and allows us to save up for a deposit.
My intention is that when interest rates rise and houses are repossessed we can go in with a deposit and buy a house at a marked down price.
We're not looking to play the market - we're looking for somewhere we can settle and lay down roots.
Rail services were severely disrupted and energy production reduced in the open-ended action over cuts affecting some 500,000 public sector workers.
Unions have vowed to extend the strike into Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, Mr Sarkozy urged a speedy end to the action, saying conditions for talks had been met.
"The president of the republic has always considered that there is more to be gained for all parties in negotiation than in conflict," said Mr Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon.
The strikes "must stop as quickly as possible in the interest of passengers", he said.
There are fears the stoppage, which began on Tuesday evening, could last for several days.
The latest disruption comes on the heels of crippling transport strikes on 18 October.
The BBC's Alasdair Sandford in Paris says that with students, teachers, civil servants and even magistrates also threatening strike action in the coming weeks, the fear for the government is that this becomes a general wave of protest against economic hardship.
Predicting a "hellish day for travellers", Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand met Mr Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon and also held talks with unions to seek a resolution.
Nationwide, fewer than a quarter of trains ran normally and only 90 of the country's 700 high-speed TGV trains were operating.
Just one in five subway trains on the Paris metro were in service and only 15% of bus services were running.
Transport managers promised marginal improvements on Thursday but warned of more severe disruption.
Across France, commuters were forced to find other ways to get to work - driving in earlier than usual, car sharing, cycling or roller blading.
More than 300km (190 miles) of traffic jams, twice the daily average, reportedly clogged roads into Paris.
While polls broadly supported Mr Sarkozy, some commuters criticised him for trying to push through change too quickly.
The last time a government tried to overhaul "special" pensions was in 1995 and it sparked three weeks of strikes that forced then-president Jacques Chirac to climb down.
But Mr Sarkozy insists France can no longer afford to allow some public service employees to retire on a full pension as early as 50 and he has vowed to stay the course.
Bosses from the CGT and CFTC unions said French workers did not want to work longer for less pension but hoped ministers might offer concessions to end the strike.
Economist Xavier Tambo said he doubted if the French president possessed the iron will of a figure like the former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Researchers have uncovered the preserved jawbone, pelvis and ribs of the dinosaur and are confident that they can unearth the full skeleton from The Weald Clay.
He said it was likely that the remains would eventually be displayed at the Maidstone Museum in Kent.
He believes the Official Secrets Act 1989 under which he'll be charged is incompatible with the Human Rights Act.
There is an argument that the Official Secrets Act falls foul of that because Shayler will not be able to argue that he caused no damage by his revelations or that he made them in the public interest.
He would spend longer in prison if he was sentenced to more than one term of two years (for example if he received two years each for two offences and the judge ordered that they run consecutively rather than concurrently).
He complained of bureaucracy and inefficiency in MI5 and blamed the Security Service for failing to put an end to the IRA's bombing campaign in Britain.
Most recently he wrote a detailed article in Punch magazine giving more details about what he says was the failure of MI5 to put an end to IRA activities in Britain before their ceasefire.
He points out that a Special Branch assessment made for the French extradition proceedings said "these disclosures would not cause serious damage to the work of the Security Service or national security".

Some 1,300 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as political differences snowballed into weeks of ethnic score-settling after the poll.
The ICC judges said that crimes against humanity may have been committed.
ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo requested the investigation last November, saying political leaders organised and financed some violence.
The ICC authorised the investigation in a majority ruling on Wednesday.
"The information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed on Kenyan territory," said two of the three judges.
Aid groups and Western governments have urged Kenya to introduce electoral reform, eradicate corruption and punish those who led the killing.
Many Kenyans will welcome this decision as it is widely felt that unless some people are punished for the post-election violence of two years ago, the events could all too easily be repeated, says the BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi.
So far nobody has been held to account for the events which took Kenya to the brink of civil war, he says
There has been virtually no attempt whatsoever by the politicians to ensure perpetrators of the violence are brought to book.
Much to the disgust of many Kenyans, the politicians are busy positioning themselves ahead of the 2012 polls instead of fixing what went wrong last time.
The ripples created by the ICC are likely to increase dramatically once Luis Moreno-Ocampo releases the names of those he intends to prosecute.
Kenya's coalition government is already shaky and will be severely tested.
But now cabinet ministers and other powerful Kenyans look set to appear in the dock before ICC judges, our correspondent adds.
Kenyan Justice Minister Mutula Kilonzo said he welcomed the move and would co-operate with the investigation.
He told the BBC the ICC was better equipped to take on the investigations than the current Kenyan legal system.
"What the government couldn't do, was to pass a law establishing a local mechanism that would have been able to facilitate investigations locally under best international practice," he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.
Following the election violence, international mediators led by former UN chief Kofi Annan were brought in to resolve the crisis.
They brokered a power-sharing government, but repeated attempts by mediators to coax the government into setting up a tribunal to investigate the violence came to nothing.
Last July Mr Annan handed to the ICC a list of those suspected of orchestrating the violence.
The names on the list have not been made public, but correspondents say they are likely to be prominent politicians and businessmen.
Some supporters of indicted politicians are likely to rally behind their leaders, raising the prospect of a new upsurge in political and ethnic tension, our correspondent says.
Bondholders now fear that Russia may consider repudiating its commitments to maintain payments on a variety of government debts, including those from the Soviet era.
So far eurobonds have been considered sacrosanct and the Russian government pledged in August that they would be the last of its obligations on which it would possibly default.
Now the British investment bank Robert Fleming, who is acting for Uneximbank, has told creditors that bondholders will not be given any priority in restructuring the $2bn debt owed by the bank.
Russia's eurobond debt is now trading at only 30% of its face value, and the eurobonds of other big Russian banks, like SBS-Agro and Rossiisky Kredit, are now trading at only 10% of their face value, indicating that the market expects a general default.
"Eurobonds don't usually have a higher ranking in legal terms, it is more a question of market expectations," said Helen Style, a lawyer with the International Primary Market Association.
In a sign of the difficulties with getting bondholders to agree anything, nearly half of all Uneximbank's bondholders were not represented at the creditors meeting this week, including the lead underwriter for the issue, Merrill Lynch.
More than 1,000 will be recruited from Poland, the biggest future member state, and just 83 from the smallest newcomer, Malta.
Of the other 10 countries joining, the Czech Republic and Hungary will get just under 500 jobs each.
At the EU's busy recruitment office, EPSO, the staff have been wading through thousands of job applications.
"Usually the candidates are really high level, so it's going to be a tough competition for the concours (entrance exam)," says EPSO boss Guy van Biesen.
It was no surprise that most applications - 10,000 - came from Poland.
But 6,000 applied from Slovakia, a country of just five million people.
It's a good sign, says Juraj Migas, Slovakia's head of mission to the EU, suggesting that lots of people are clearly interested in European integration.
But he admits it is not all good.
"There are some people, not only from institutions in Slovakia, but also from different government ministries and even here in the mission who will apply for the concours," he says.
At the missions of some applicant countries, as many as one in five diplomats have already applied for EU jobs.
And work in many ministries back home is said to have slowed down because officials are busy studying for the next exams.
There will be 50 this year altogether for interpreters, translators, assistants and civil servants.
There is no age limit and European institutions say they make no discrimination whatsoever.
The new Eurocrats will be university graduates who can work in a multicultural environment and are perfectly fluent in at least two EU official languages.
And they will be rich, at least by Central European standards.
The only comfort for countries like Slovakia is that the figures are relatively small - there will be only 279 Slovak Eurocrats, recruited over seven years.
Officials are also stressing that the appointment procedure will be rigorous and fair.
"No-one, no government, no one in the leadership of government, no other appointee, no senior manager will have the right, in any shape or form, to make any appointments on the basis of personal preference, unless people coming in have satisfied the rigorous qualification requirements," said Neil Kinnock, the European Commissioner in charge of administrative reform.
Researchers at the Institute of Child Health in London followed 13,000 children to the age of three.
They found for every 10 hours worked the risk of being overweight rose once household income topped �11,000, the International Journal of Obesity said.
Experts said it was a "wake-up call" for the middle classes.
Some 23% of the children in the study were overweight or obese by the age of three.
But the researchers found a link between the risk of obesity and the amount of income earned.
Those earning �22,000 to �33,000 were 10% more likely to be overweight per 10 hours worked than households earning under �11,000.
While those earning over �33,000 were 15% more likely.
However, the researchers also noted that among the working mothers group - 7,500 in total - the risk was 13% and 19% greater.
They said working mothers were also less likely to breastfeed for the recommended amount of time.
And those with higher incomes were more likely to have demanding jobs.
But the researchers also stressed the need for high-earning families with just one parent working to consider their behaviour.
They said those who earned more were more likely to be able to afford convenience food which could be contributing to the increased risk.
Communications with the boarding team were lost at the time the boarding ended - at 0910.
An independent criminal probe has begun into the death of Ian Tomlinson, 47, who had a heart attack minutes after the incident on 1 April.
More video aired on Channel 4 appears to show him being hit with a baton.
The Metropolitan Police (Met) has now acknowledged Mr Tomlinson came "into contact with police" before he died.
Initially the force said it was unaware he had sustained the alleged assault and said its officers' first contact with him was when they gave him medical aid before he died.
"It is now clear that Mr Tomlinson did come into contact with police prior to his death and that a number of the officers depicted in the footage on a national newspaper's website have identified themselves as MPS officers," it said in a statement.
Scotland Yard said the officer seen on Channel 4 footage was one of four who had come forward to give information.
The IPCC has ordered a second post-mortem test as part of its inquiry.
Mr Tomlinson's stepson Paul King said the footage has "deeply touched" the family and said "we cannot lay our father to rest" until they get justice.
The IPCC began its investigation before footage surfaced of Mr Tomlinson being shoved.
The watchdog said it would examine the footage and discuss it with the Crown Prosecution Service.
Following Mr Tomlinson's death, the IPCC initially said it would oversee an investigation into the incident to be carried out by the City of London police.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no officers had been suspended.
The video, shot at 1929 BST at the Royal Exchange Passage, appears to show newspaper vendor Mr Tomlinson, who was going home from work and not protesting, walking away from a group of police officers.
The footage, recorded by a New York fund manager, appears to show Mr Tomlinson landing heavily after being pushed by an officer.
Minutes later, Mr Tomlinson collapsed and died of a heart attack, after walking about 50 yards to nearby Cornhill where he received first aid from police.
The Guardian newspaper obtained the video and has handed it to the IPCC.
And new footage, taken by a Channel 4 News cameraman, shows an officer apparently hitting him left-handed with a baton, then shoving him to the ground.
The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said the images raised "obvious concerns" and pledged full support from the force.
The local authority said the efficiency measures were required as it prepared for "dark times ahead".
Proposals approved by the council on Wednesday included creating a charitable trust to run its arts and cultural services.
Union representatives warned of further cuts to come in the future.
The council said it would will also be sourcing alternative providers to run its fleet of vehicles.
Longer term plans for services provided by the local authority include partnerships with other public bodies to deliver environmental health and trading standards, privatisation of nursery provision and reducing gritting during winter months.
The proposals follow an all-party members' seminar held by the council at the beginning of March to look at developing an efficiency agenda during the current recession.
The transport minister said there would still be measures to ease traffic flow along the M4
Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones said the bill for a proposed M4 relief road around Newport had risen to £1bn from its £340m estimate in 1998.
Unveiling a five-year transport plan, Mr Jones also dropped a proposed access road to Cardiff Airport, a decision one local MP called "economic lunacy".
Conservative assembly members called the decisions "depressing and disturbing".
But environment campaign group Friends of the Earth Cymru said the six-lane motorway scheme through the Gwent Levels was a "victim of its own price tag in a credit crunch".
The announcement was made as part of a five-year plan, which includes improved rail services and promotion of greener transport, such as cycling and car-sharing schemes.
It came after two crashes in previous months had caused gridlock to the south Wales corridor, prompting business leaders to say the economy of the area had been affected by the traffic congestion.
In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Jones said putting tolls on the "unaffordable" proposed new road would have reduced its economic effectiveness.
He said putting tolls on the existing motorway as well as the relief road would be "unacceptable to business and the travelling public" given there were already tolls at the two Severn crossings.
He said the assembly government would instead spend between £64m and £110m improving the existing M4 network
Measures would include improvements around Tredegar Park junction, the Brynglas tunnels and the Coldra roundabout, bringing into public use a seven-mile dual carriageway through the Corus site in Newport, and improving the southern distributor road through Newport.
Mr Jones said he was aware of the arguments for and against the M4 relief road.
Neil Crumpton, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, said axing the motorway plan provided "a huge opportunity for the assembly government to resolve the M4's increasing safety and maintenance problems by investing in much more cost-effective and less damaging measures along the M4 and other local routes".
On the airport access road, Mr Jones said "only a fraction" of the benefits a proposed airport link road would bring the area were associated with the airport.
As an alternative, he said the assembly government would investigate a half-hourly bus express bus service from Cardiff city centre to the airport, more frequent train services and improved safety on the A4266 (Five Mile Road).
Cardiff Airport said it welcomed the decision to "end the uncertainty" and also the "more pragmatic and sensible approach" to enhance public transport options between the airport and the city.
But Vale of Glamorgan MP John Smith said the decision not to go ahead with the airport relief road was "economic lunacy" and a "reckless decision for the Welsh economy".

The former West Brom boss took over at Celtic Park from previous manager Gordon Strachan back in June.
Celtic started the season with hopes of winning the SPL, but with three games left to play the team sit 10 points behind league leaders Glasgow Rangers.
Mowbray was Celtic's 16th manager and used to play for the club between 1991 and 1995.

Its name is taken from the year in which the MPs who originally formed it were elected.
If a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses the support of the 1922 Committee then they could be in a particularly vulnerable position, as Conservative cabinets and shadow cabinets are normally expected to take the views of the committee very seriously.
The most important task that the head of the committee has is overseeing the election of the Tory party leader.

This information is based on the most frequently spoken phrases by this representative.
Most people will get at least 12,000 yen ($121; £86) under the $20bn plan.
But there are fears many Japanese, who have a strong tradition of saving, will hang on to the cash and not spend it.
The cash hand-out forms the centrepiece of a stimulus package to revive Japan's economy, which is in a far sharper recession than the US or Europe.
Children under 18 and people aged over 65 would get 20,000 yen as part of the scheme, which was first proposed in October last year.
Some critics of the plan say it is a ploy to boost the popularity of Prime Minister Taro Aso and will only expand Japan's bulging budget deficit.
Mr Aso's approval ratings have sunk to about 10%, and he must call an election by September.
The legislation enacting the stimulus plan has been mired in Japan's parliament for weeks.
It was passed after the government-controlled lower house overruled a no vote in the upper house, which is dominated by the opposition.
It has not quite worked out like that - though some important goals were achieved.
A parliamentary election in March, unlike many previous elections, was free and fair - so much so, that the winner was the man who "lost" the Orange Revolution, the pro-Russian former prime minister Viktor Yanukovych.
He has now been nominated again for the premiership, which, under constitutional amendments brought in after the Orange Revolution, would make him the most powerful man in the country.
But many of the Revolution's promised changes did not occur.
Any political goals the leaders of the Orange Revolution may have shared were forgotten during the coalition government headed by Yulia Tymoshenko, which took office in February 2005, and quickly descended into in-fighting.
Mr Yushchenko then outraged many of his own supporters by turning to his rival, Mr Yanukovych, for help in a parliamentary vote to confirm his new prime ministerial nominee.
Now Mr Yanukovych has the upper hand, and is inviting Mr Yushchenko's party to join his coalition.
Mr Yushchenko now has to decide whether to agree, or whether it would be better for his Our Ukraine party to go into opposition.
A third option, favoured by Ms Tymoshenko, would be for him to dissolve parliament and call new elections.
"It is a Catch 22 situation," says Taras Kuzio, a senior fellow of the US body, the German Marshall Fund.
For example, the "anti-crisis coalition" formed by his Party of Regions, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, pledges to continue moving towards Mr Yushchenko's goal of EU membership and to abide by any result of a referendum on Nato membership.
How long a Yanukovych government would last is also unclear.
The Party of Regions' big business backers do not have much in common with the Communists, and neither group has much in common with the more "Orange" members of the Socialist Party, some of whom have already begun splitting away.
So whatever happens next, Ukraine seems far from a return to political stability.
The University of Southern California found a lack of zinc, iron, vitamin B and protein in the first three years caused bad behaviour later on.
At eight years old, children fed poorly were more likely to be irritable and pick fights than those fed healthily.
Aged 11, they swore, cheated and got into fights, and at 17, they stole, bullied others and took drugs.
The researchers analysed the development of more than 1,000 children on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, over 14 years.
They found the more malnurished the children were, the greater the anti-social behaviour later on.
The team took into account factors such as social background, health and education, the American Journal of Psychiatry reported.
Report co-author Adrian Raine said parents could prevent their children developing bad behaviour by ensuring they get better diets.
"Poor nutrition leads to low IQ, which leads to later anti-social behaviour.
"At a societal level, should parents be thinking more about what kids are eating?
"There's more to anti-social behaviour than nutrition, but we argue that it is an important missing link.
Fellow researcher Jianghong Liu, of the university's Social Science Research Institute, agreed.
But Dr Ann Hagell, research development adviser at the Nuffield Foundation, a charitable trust which funds social and education research, raised doubts about the findings.
"I would not dismiss the study out-of-hand but I would be surprised if diet plays a big role.
"In my experience diet is not part of the explanation.
The Developing Patient Partnerships survey suggests the missed GP appointments alone cost the NHS �180m.
The GPs questioned said forgetfulness was the main cause and 70% said they would consider removing persistent offenders from their lists.
But an organisation which insures doctors warned GPs this should be the last resort.
Two-thirds of the 683 surgeries surveyed said patients should be charged for missing an appointment.
Most doctors who responded to the survey said missed appointments increased waiting times, wasted NHS money and resources and harmed GPs' ability to meet primary care targets.
Doctors believe simple forgetfulness is the main reason why people fail to turn up for their appointment.
However, some blamed patients feeling better, and deciding not to attend.
"Almost everyone is likely to have difficulties booking an appointment to see their GP at some point.
"Patients are right to expect a modernised responsive and accessible service.
"In most circumstances, removing a patient from a list should be a last resort, to be used when all other options have been exhausted.
The technique uses fat from the stomach or thigh which is then enriched with stem cells before being injected.
It is hoped the method could prove a more natural-looking alternative to artificial implants filled with salt water or silicone.
Kotaro Yoshimura, a surgeon at the Tokyo University medical school, said more than 40 patients had been treated.
Mr Yoshimura said he believed the stem cell and fat combination, which can increase a woman's cupsize by two sizes, was a success.
"There have been no serious complications," he said.
During the operation, surgeons suck fat cells from the stomach or thigh, and this "slurry" is enriched so that there are higher numbers than usual of stem cells.
These are "master" cells which are capable of making new fat cells.
When the enriched stem cell mixture is combined with normal fat tissue, it can then be injected into the breast area.
The treatment aims to offer a softer more natural look than traditional silicone implants.
Mr Yoshimura said the he believed combining stem cells with fat gave an improved result.
He said breast enlargement using fat and stem cells did not create a lumpy effect.
Lots of small particles were added rather than "one big lump".
Cellport Clinic Yokohama in Japan are currently the only ones to provide the treatment.
Consultant Norman Waterhouse said he had concerns about such a procedure.
However, Adam Searle, past president of British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the development should not be dismissed.
"There is exciting potential but no reality in practical terms at the moment.
Three months on from September 11, the financial community in New York is looking to the future.
Despite the scale of human losses, many of the banks and stockbroking firms that occupied the World Trade Center have returned to some kind of normality.
But while many companies are coping with the crisis, the future for the financial district of Lower Manhattan is less certain.
The Twin Towers were more than just symbols of New York and its pre-eminent position in the financial world.
The firm's chief executive officer, Craig Spitzer, says a counsellor was brought in to help the survivors.
"We will move forward to honour the work of the people who died," says Craig Spitzer.
The exodus of financial institutions from Lower Manhattan has hit many small businesses.
The shoe repairers, the dry cleaners and the coffee shops that relied on the trade from the Twin Towers are now struggling to survive.
He has managed to obtain a number of grants, including a 20-year loan from the Small Business Association.
The American Red Cross helped out with mortgage and cell phone bills, and the business will benefit from tax breaks.
"We were closed for two weeks, and when we returned there was dust and debris inside the store," Mr Rafeld recalls.
Many of the banks and stockbrokers that lost their offices at the World Trade Center moved to other locations in the city, notably the Midtown area.
According to one estimate, the district has lost 100,000 jobs, half of them from the World Trade Center.
Warren Wechsler, of the Real Estate Board of New York, believes that the state of the economy will determine how quickly Lower Manhattan recovers.
"The tragedy may have accelerated the downward trend in that part of the city," he says.
But some are wondering whether there will be a need for another World Trade Center, on the same scale as the Twin Towers.
Apart from the cost of rebuilding, there are now doubts about whether office workers in New York will ever feel happy about occupying such tall buildings.
So will the attacks on September 11 signal the end for the skyscraper?
Leading the team is Jonathan Agnew, former Leicestershire and England bowler and the BBC's cricket correspondent.

Sol Campbell's dream of a winning return to Spurs was wrecked as Arsenal keeper Richard Wright gifted Gus Poyet an injury-time equaliser.
Campbell looked to have silenced the taunts of a vengeful White Hart Lane, with the Gunners on course to edge out their north London rivals.
He was comfortably behind Poyet's drive in the third minute of stoppage time, but allowed the ball to squirm from his grasp to give grateful Spurs a share of the points.
It was a bitter moment for Arsenal, and particularly Campbell.
He was forced to endure a cascade of abuse on his comeback to the club he left to join arch-rivals Arsenal in the summer
The villian of a highly-charged piece removed any lingering tension from his system with his first touch of real intent, a clattering challenge that took out both Les Ferdinand and Gustavo Poyet.
The Campbell sub-plot overshadowed early exchanges which resembled two dogs fighting over a bone.
And nowhere was that misplaced spirit better exemplified than in the battle between Martin Keown and Les Ferdinand - both eventually booked by referee Jeff Winter.
Football occasionally broke out amid the hostilities, and Spurs were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 26 minutes.
Arsenal had shown little attacking initiative, and were grateful to see Ferdinand's goal ruled out on the stroke of half-time for handball.
Arsenal players demanded the red card for Ferdinand, who had already been booked.
Poyet's late runs from midfield were troubling Arsenal, and he stole in once more to head over the bar.
Arsenal had just announced their arrival in the game as an attacking force, with Sullivan diving to his left to save spectacularly from Pires.
Wright was forced into a scrambling save from Poyet - and then Sullivan repeated his heroics to deny Pires once more.
Spurs boss Hoddle attempted to counter Arsenal's growing authority by replacing Ferdinand with Sergei Rebrov, while Wenger hauled off the disappointing Dennis Bergkamp for Kanu.
Campbell endured a nightmare moment with 13 minutes left when he sliced the ball agonisingly close to his own goal - but he was spared by an offside flag.
He took advantage of good work by Sylvain Wiltord to score from 25 yards - although Spurs keeper Sullivan should have saved after getting a firm contact on the ball.
Arsenal looked to be heading for victory - until Wright's slip brought joy for Spurs and Poyet.
BBC F1 pit-lane reporter Ted Kravitz analyses the allegations of race-fixing being faced by the Renault team over last year's Singapore Grand Prix.
Hoy beat Dave Daniell in the sprint and Matt Crampton in the invitation keirin at the Revolution event in Manchester.
"I am ready to knuckle down for the next 15 weeks before the World Championships," said Hoy.
Hoy's performance came amid reports he has been told to cut down on public appearances and concentrate on training again.
Hoy, who won the individual sprint, team sprint and keirin in Beijing to take his Olympic gold medal tally to four, began his season with a sprint victory at the Milan 6 at the beginning of November.
He was greeted on his return to Manchester by a packed crowd, who gave him a standing ovation on his announcement and queued for autographs.
In the keirin he launched a two-lap assault to overcome Crampton in a field that included Dutch keirin great Teun Mulder.
Among Hoy's forthcoming off-track commitments is Sunday's Race of Champions, against F1 start Lewis Hamilton at Wembley.
However, he will move to Perth in Western Australia at the start of January for a five-week training camp.
He then plans to race the final leg of the World Cup in Copenhagen before the World Championships in Pruszkow, Poland, in March.
Paul became the sixth big name to exit Odsal when he joined Huddersfield - and Hape is unhappy at the way the Bulls have treated their club captain.
"He has been there since 1994 and helped build the club's success in Super League," Hape told BBC Sport.
Paul had 12 months left on his contract but was given permission to find a new club after slipping down the pecking order in his favoured half-back role.
The Bulls blamed salary-cap restrictions for Paul's departure, but Hape said more could have been done to keep his fellow Kiwi.
"I was devastated when I first found out because I talked to him just before I signed my contract," said Hape.
"He still had a year to go on his and was pretty sure he was going to stay.
"Off the field, he's been brilliant for the club and the sport in terms of marketing the game.
"I just think the way the club handled it wasn't right.
"By announcing it now, they haven't even given the fans the chance to send him off properly at Odsal.
Hape has developed a close friendship with Paul since arriving at Bradford in 2003.
"The fact we knew Robbie and several other guys were leaving helped us finish the season so well," said Hape.
Paul's departure follows those of Jamie Peacock, Leon Pryce, Stuart Reardon, Rob Parker and Lee Radford.
And Hape admitted he was worried about Bradford's strength in depth.
"I just think it's going to be tough, though, with the guys we've lost in key positions," he said.
And Hape believes they can make a major contribution to the Bradford's hopes of beating Wests Tigers in the World Club Challenge.
"People go on about their age but their experience will be great for one-off games like the World Club Challenge," said the New Zealand international.
Danish police made a number of arrests during the protests
The move came after youths threw bricks and smashed windows as more than 30,000 demonstrators marched to demand action at the UN climate change summit.
A police spokesman said "almost all" of those arrested have now been released with just a few facing charges.
Similar marches have been held in cities around the world, calling for decisive action on global warming.
Meanwhile, ministers have started arriving to join other delegates at the UN summit which runs for another week.
Documents prepared by the conference's leaders call on developed nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 25% and 45% of 1990 levels by 2020.
The colourful parade, with some people dressed in polar bear suits, departed Parliament Square amid tight security.
According to reports, police moved in when masked youths threw bricks and smashed windows in the centre of the city.
Denmark's parliament recently passed controversial laws giving police powers of pre-emptive arrest of anyone they believe is likely to break the law.
The exact target for limiting temperature rise is unclear amid disputes between various blocs.
Danish police estimate that some 30,000 people joined the march while organisers put the number at 100,000.
They marched 6km (four miles) across the city to the conference centre where negotiators and ministers are meeting.
After violence erupted, large numbers of mainly young people were detained.
Henrek Suhr, of Copenhagen police, told the BBC that their intelligence had suggested a small group of people had planned violence.
He rejected claims by climate protesters that some of those being held had been mistreated and denied access to basic needs.
Simon Sheikh, of the Australian social and political network "Get Up", said he had witnessed the detentions from his apartment in the centre of the city.
"The police rounded up protesters in a pre-planned manoeuvre," he told the BBC.
A police spokesman said just four or five out of 968 arrested would be charged and appear in court.
He said most of those who had been arrested had been part of an organised group which had been throwing fireworks and stones.
Activists are arguing for an ambitious, legally binding agreement on emissions cuts to be signed by world leaders at the summit's conclusion at the end of next week.
A number of famous figures said they would join the protest, among them Bollywood actor Rahul Bose, model and photographer Helena Christensen and former UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson.
In Australia, where events were held as part of the country's fifth Walk Against Warming, the largest protest was held in Melbourne.
The march closed with protesters spelling out the message "Safe Climate - Do It!" on the ground.
Organisers said aerial photographs had been taken and would be sent to delegates at the talks in Copenhagen.
Thousands of demonstrators also gathered in front of Australia's parliament house in the capital, Canberra.
Karl Rove, the man widely seen as the mastermind behind President Bush's two election wins, announced on 13 August that he was leaving the White House.
Two weeks later, Alberto Gonzales tendered his resignation as US attorney general, effective from 17 September.
The appointment of the staunchly religious, anti-abortion John Ashcroft as attorney general, in charge of the Department of Justice, was an early sign that the Bush White House would be keen to reward the religious right for its electoral support.
Ashcroft was widely disliked by liberals for his package of security measures after 9/11, perceived as an attack on civil liberties.
However, this opposition turned to grudging admiration when it later emerged that Mr Ashcroft - whilst ill in hospital in 2004 - had rejected a White House request to authorise a scheme to allow the warrantless wire-tapping of US citizens.
After his departure in 2005, Mr Ashcroft set up a lobbying company advising clients involved in the homeland security industry.
When Mr Bush chose Mr Cheney as his running mate in 2000 the decision was seen as an attempt to reassure voters that the young Bush would be able to draw on Mr Cheney's wisdom and experience.
A long-standing political operator, Mr Cheney had served in Congress and in the administrations of a number of former presidents.
After the election, Mr Cheney used his knowledge of the mechanics of government to become one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, seen by some as the "power behind the throne".
With the president's approval, Mr Cheney has had a great deal of influence over a number of policy areas, in particular energy and foreign affairs.
He has also developed a reputation for secrecy, refusing to allow congressional oversight of some of his activities.
Health permitting, he will remain in office until the end of the administration's second term.
Mr Rove managed Mr Bush's two successful Texas gubernatorial campaigns in the 1990s as well as the 2000 presidential campaign.
He has been described variously as "Bush's Brain", "evil Rasputin" and - by the president himself - "Turd Blossom", a reference to a Texan flower which blooms on manure.
His success in producing Republican electoral victories and the often cunning, partisan way in which the victories have been achieved has made him unpopular with the president's political opponents.
His resignation came amid calls for him to testify in the Senate about his role in the sacking of a number of US attorneys and the launch of a probe into political briefings to government officials by him and his team.
Mr Fleischer was the public face of the administration from 2001 until 2003.
His primary job was to answer journalists' questions at daily White House press conferences, and he was seen as a safe pair of hands in the role.
He later became a key player in the "Scooter" Libby trial, after his testimony to a grand jury showed that Mr Libby had in fact known the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame weeks before he claimed to have been informed of it by journalists.
Mr Fleischer now works in the private sector as a communications consultant, and has denied reports that he is seeking to run for Congress in his home district in New York.
Alberto Gonzales served as Mr Bush's counsel during his time as Texas governor and followed him to the White House in 2001.
He went on to replace Mr Ashcroft as attorney general in 2005, and later became embroiled in the row over the sacking of a number of US attorneys.
He repeatedly rejected calls for his resignation by members of Congress but on 27 August he announced he was leaving his post.
Ms Hughes worked for Mr Bush as director of communications for five years when he was Texas governor and then became one of his closest advisers when he first arrived in the White House.
After a two-year spell back in Texas from 2002-04, she rejoined Mr Bush's team, first as an election planner and then - from 2005 - as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, charged with improving the image of the US abroad.
Ms Hughes announced on 31 October that she would be leaving the State Department by the end of the year.
Harriet Miers was another of George W Bush's Texan inner circle to follow him to Washington when he became president.
She shot to prominence in October 2005 when Mr Bush announced her as his nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court after the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor.
But she withdrew her nomination after critics from both parties complained that she was not sufficiently qualified.
She remained as White House counsel until January 2007, when she resigned, reportedly at the instigation of the White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten.
Colin Powell, the first-ever African-American secretary of state, was more politically moderate than many of Mr Bush's other senior appointees.
His time at the state department was dominated by disputes with the vice-president and with Donald Rumsfeld, both of whom favoured a more belligerent policy towards Iraq.
Despite private misgivings, Mr Powell played a prominent role in administration attempts to make a public case for war.
It later emerged that he had also disagreed with Mr Rumsfeld's war strategy, and had argued that more troops should be sent than had been allocated in Mr Rumsfeld's plans.
Since his resignation in 2004, Mr Powell has become increasingly critical of the Bush administration, in particular of the conduct of the war and the treatment of detainees.
Prior to her appointment as national security adviser (NSA) Ms Rice was a professor of political science at Stanford University, with a successful academic track record in foreign policy.
She is seen as an incredibly loyal servant of the president, however, and her 2005 promotion to secretary of state was not unexpected.
Her distance from the decision to invade Iraq and her relative popularity in the US and abroad suggest that she will be one of the few members of the Bush inner circle to have a political future after the president's departure.
Mr Rumsfeld was a controversial defence secretary and the key architect of the "shock and awe" strategy used to fight the war in Iraq.
The worsening news from Iraq led to major Republican losses in the 2006 mid-term elections and Mr Rumsfeld resigned soon afterwards.
He is now working on his memoirs and planning the establishment of an educational foundation.
He was forced to resign in 2007 over his role in awarding a $60,000 pay-rise to his partner, Shaha Riza, who had worked at the bank, and is now a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank.
The cases - up around 600 since Friday - mean the US has now surpassed Mexico as the most affected nation.
But the total of three confirmed deaths is far lower than in Mexico where 48 people are known to have died.
In Mexico, people worked over the weekend to clean and disinfect primary schools which are due to resume classes after a two-week break.
However, several Mexican states are delaying the return to school for another week amid more suspected new cases.
Secondary schools and universities re-opened last week as part of a gradual resumption of business after a shutdown of several days ordered by the Mexican government in a bid to stem the outbreak.
Officials warn that the virus has still to run its course.
"More cases, more hospitalisations and more deaths from this outbreak will occur over the coming days and weeks, " a CDC statement said.
A jump in confirmed cases is also likely because the CDC has developed a kit for testing that is being distributed across the US and Puerto Rico, as well as internationally.
"This increase in testing capacity is likely to result in an increase in the number of reported confirmed cases in this country, which should provide a more accurate picture of the burden of disease in the United States," the CDC said.
The newspapers are, as always, full of the details of the escalating conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The paper quotes the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as saying that Israel now faces a protracted and difficult battle.
The Arabic papers also highlight the tight security in Jerusalem and say there will be an Israeli crackdown on any possible unrest, such as stone-throwing, after Friday prayers in the Old City.
The wood sample is from the original tree from which an apple fell, leading Newton to devise his theory of gravity.
The sample, which is normally held in the Royal Society's archives, has been lent to British-born astronaut Dr Piers Sellers, who will take it into orbit.
The Atlantis shuttle will lift off for on 14 May carrying six crew members.
The 12-day mission is expected to be the Nasa orbiter's last.
The move is part of the Royal Society's 350th anniversary celebrations.
The tree sample will be accompanied on its trip into space by an image of Sir Isaac, which was also donated by the Royal Society.
Dr Sellers, who was selected as an astronaut candidate by Nasa in 1996, said he and the other team members were "delighted" to be taking a piece of the historic tree into orbit.
Sir Isaac, a physicist and mathematician, is widely regarded as being one of the greatest scientists of his era.
He recounted the story that inspired his theory of gravitation to scholar William Stukeley and it later appeared in Stukeley's 1752 biography, Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life.
In the story, Sir Isaac claimed to have been inspired by a falling apple in his garden to investigate the theory of gravitation.
After the spaceflight, the tree sample and picture will be returned to the Royal Society.
Lord Rees, the academic institution's current president, said it was "both pleased and proud that such an extraordinary part of scientific history and important element of the Royal Society's archive collection can make this historic trip into space".
He said the piece of tree and picture of Sir Isaac will go on to form part of the History of the Royal Society exhibition that the society will be holding later this year and will then be held as a permanent exhibit.
As the Gore and Bush camps squabble over every single vote in the state of Florida, lawsuits and counter lawsuits have already made it to the state Supreme Court and a federal appeals court.
In the absence of a clear result and with the stakes so high, the process could, in theory, go all the way up to the US Supreme Court.
European leaders meeting in Brussels have agreed a deal which they hope will secure the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, as debate continues over Tony Blair becoming first president of the European Union.
Conservative leader David Cameron has said it was an appointment and a role he did not support.
Mr Cameron added that the British people should have a referendum on the European constitution, and the Tories would act if the Treaty was passed.
The Scottish Spina Bifida Association said 15 babies had been born in Scotland with the condition since January - double the normal number.
It said folic acid supplements, which research suggests can prevent many cases, were often taken too late.
Its advice targets all sexually active women of childbearing age because of the numbers of unplanned pregnancies.
Children born with spina bifida are often paralysed from the waist down and can suffer lifelong spinal cord, bowel and bladder problems.
Some children also have brain damage.
Research suggests up to 75% of cases could be prevented by the mother taking folic acid three months before conception, and during pregnancy.
Five-year-old Ella Chambers was diagnosed with spina bifida at birth.
She cannot walk and has hydrocephalus, or water on the brain.
"We don't know if this is down to folic acid but we do know that most women don't take enough folic acid at the right time.
"Ladies do know about folic acid preventing spina bifida but they wait until they've missed a period before they start taking it.
It's not known whether the same trend has been seen in other parts of the country, as the latest figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland date back to 2007.
Five-year-old Ella Chambers and her mother on living with spina bifida
Scotland has the highest rate of children born with spina bifida in the UK because Scottish mothers are less likely to abort the foetus once the condition is diagnosed.
Half of affected pregnancies are terminated in Scotland, compared with 90% in the rest of the UK.
In 2007 the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommended that folic acid should be added to bread or flour.
However that recommendation is under review following new research which suggested it could increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
The FSA said that anyone who is not about to become pregnant could get enough folic acid from a balanced diet.

BK Frem head coach Anders Theil said the club could command a transfer fee if the player impressed and signed a permanent deal at Ibrox.
"It's good for Adda, and he could join Rangers after the loan period and BK Frem could receive some money," said Theil.

A 21-year old woman was arrested after the attack at about 1500 BST at the Beckton Globe Library in Newham, where the MP holds a regular surgery.
Mr Timms served at the Treasury under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and was recently re-elected as MP for East Ham.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a knife had been recovered from the scene.
Unmesh Desai, the MP's aide during the general election, said Mr Timms was "obviously shaken".
The MP will undergo exploratory surgery to see the extent of his injuries and will remain in hospital overnight.
A 16-year-old girl, who did not want to be named, was present at the incident and described the scene.
The woman was disarmed by one of Mr Timms' assistants, Andrew Bazeley, before the security guard arrived, Sir Robin added.
The MP has told friends he had not met her before and has no idea why she attacked him.
MP Timms stabbed in stomach
Liberal Democrat peer Nigel Jones was himself wounded and his aide Andrew Pennington was killed in a sword attack in 2000 during a weekly constituency surgery in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
He said that following the 2000 attack police recommended security measures for him including installing a panic button, which were followed.
The peer suggested that all MPs, especially new MPs, should contact police and see that their security arrangements are "fit for purpose".
Several MPs sent Mr Timms their best wishes via Twitter.
Mr Timms has regularly spoken out against knife crime in his constituency, particularly among young people.
In 2006, he spoke at an event to mark the death of 15-year-old Charlotte Polius, who was stabbed while walking in the street the previous year.
Mr Timms later issued a statement expressing his "thanks and gratitude to both the staff at Beckton Globe for their assistance, and the ambulance and hospital staff for their fantastic care".
The MP was a close confidant of both Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling during Labour's 13 years in government, serving latterly as financial secretary to the Treasury.
He has been MP for the constituency - and previously for Newham North East - since 1994.
Married to Hui-Leng Lim, he describes himself as a Christian Socialist and is Labour's vice-chairman for faith groups.
The group, led by 55-year-old Shunichi Miyazaki, is suspected of charging more than 1,000 people between 30,000 and 1 million yen ($253-8,449) for an exorcism, the paper said.
Most of the victims were believed to be women in their 20s or 30s, the Daily Yomiuri said.
The group allegedly operated in the Tokyo area, as well as in Nagoya, Osaka and Kanagawa prefecture.
A spokesman for Kanagawa prefecture police said the victims were taken to the group's "oratory" in the mountains near Kamakura, in Kanagawa, or to hotel rooms, where the exorcisms were performed.
Mr Miyazaki told the Daily Yomiuri he did not set out to dupe the women.
Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee is the focus of all Elvis fans at the 25th anniversary of his death, and where they flocked for a candlelit vigil to commemorate the King of Rock'n'Roll.
But plans to build a huge rival Elvis theme park a short distance away have infuriated Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that oversees the star's estate.
For more than 20 years the King reigned at Graceland, throwing parties in the Jungle Room and driving his pink Cadillac around the grounds.
Soon after he died there in 1977, the home was opened to the public and around 70,000 people visit every year.
Most find it a moving experience.
"Elvis was such a generous person and his talent was unequalled," said one visitor.
"There's never been another person like him and there'll never be another one," another added.
At the end of the tour, Graceland visitors enter the meditation garden.
There's a small fountain and the grave of Elvis and his parents.
Most people take photographs, some say prayers.
Fifteen minutes drive from Graceland, near the small town of Hornlake in Tennessee, lies the Circle G Ranch, which was owned by Elvis in the 1960s.
Local entrepreneur JD Stacy has grand plans for the site.
"Here is a bridge which was built by Elvis 30 years ago and at the end of the bridge will be a duplication of the [Elvis] White House, two storeys, 35 thousand square feet," he said.
Elvis himself wanted a replica of the White House on the ranch, although he never got around to building it during his lifetime.
His cousin Donna Presley says Circle G was a great place to spend time.
"The first year that we moved there, there was a big snow, which is not something that happens around here very often, and Elvis loved snow," she said.
"He took a tractor and hooked up aluminium boats from the pond there and dragged everyone on the ranch around until he tore the bottom out of the boats.
The developers want to call the site the Elvis Presley Ranch - but the name Elvis Presley is a trademark, strenuously protected by Elvis Presley Enterprises.
But that doesn't worry JD Stacy.
"Elvis owned this ranch and on the deed it said the Elvis Presley ranch," he said.
However, Todd Morgan of Elvis Presley Enterprises says Mr Stacy will run into trouble if he uses the Elvis brand name.
"They can't name it after Elvis or advertise it and merchandise it and do business under that name, our trademark name, without our permission," Mr Morgan said.
"We don't own the land, Elvis got rid of it and we're not interested in developing anything there ourselves or re-acquiring the land and if somebody wants to do a good project down there that benefits the surrounding community then that's great," he said.
Of course, getting the grand plan off the ground requires lots of money, and a good deal of building skill.
"I don't have any track record in doing this and neither does anybody else because this will be the one and only Elvis Presley theme park in the world," said Mr Stacy.
The developers are hoping to start work on the new theme park later this month.
And progress will be watched carefully not only by the fans, but by Elvis Presley Enterprises and their lawyers.
Trade ministers have given themselves till 31 December to find a compromise deal allowing developing countries to make generic copies of patented drugs and export them.
Now, said Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile at a World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting in Sydney, the end is in sight.
"We've got a clear deadline, it is in sight and the outcome is in sight," he said.
The breakthrough overshadowed the heavy security and loud protests which have now become part of the trade talks process.
The big problem in reaching a deal to date is that the agendas of the Western drug companies and those of poorer states are radically at odds.
For the drug giants, preserving their patents and the high prices their drugs can command is the priority.
Indeed, Swiss company Roche was accused on Friday of inflating the cost of its proprietary Aids drug Viracept to poor countries, despite having promised to cut it.
According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, the company charges more for Viracept in Guatemala and the Ukraine, for instance, than in Switzerland itself, while even elsewhere its discounts are much less generous than those of some other big drugmakers.
But for countries in Africa and Asia where sometimes as much as a quarter of the population is HIV positive, or where TB is rampant, those prices make treatment impossible.
And that risks condemning the countries concerned to social and economic catastrophe.
A previous deal allowed countries to make generic copies in times of medical crisis - although the drug companies, with the assistance of their home governments, quibbled over what constituted a "crisis".
But exports were banned, spelling doom for countries without a pharmaceuticals industry.
The devil of the new deal will be in the detail, which has still to be settled.
It looks likely, for instance, that it will be limited to just Aids, TB and malaria, although developing countries wanted other diseases like cancer and diabetes included.
And it remains to be seen whether the terms for export of generic drugs, vital for the many smaller developing states facing disaster thanks to Aids, will be free enough to make a real difference.
Till now, the opposition from the richer countries to opening up the market has been implacable, despite the dire straits in which their poorer neighbours find themselves.
But the trade talks which are meant to be complete by 2005 are bogged down in arguments over agriculture, as Europe - and to a lesser extent Japan and the US - refuse to make significant concessions on their massive farm subsidies.
Giving ground on the drug talks, said WTO director general Supachai Panitchpakdi, could help persuade developing countries that the West's commitment to the so-called "development round" of talks is genuine.
Speaking at a press conference, Jackson's brother Jermaine told reporters that up to 25 performers had been lined up to sing.
The artists will play some of Jackson's greatest hits at the concert, including Thriller and Billie Jean.
More acts will be revealed later this week, Jackson said.
Akon, Angela Bassett, and the Germany-based boy band US5 will also perform at the gig, which will take place in front of Vienna's former imperial Schoenbrunn Palace.
Jermaine said the venue had been chosen because his brother "loved castles".
He also revealed that he planned to sing a virtual duet with his late brother.
Brown previously stood in Jackson's shoes to perform a tribute to Thriller at the 2006 World Music Awards in London.
Jackson had been expected to perform at the ceremony, but disappointed fans by only singing a few lines of We Are The World.
Brown singer was recently sentenced to 80 days' community labour and five years' probation for assaulting his pop star ex-girlfriend Rihanna.
Jackson passed away in June after suffering a cardiac arrest.
Last month, the Los Angeles coroner announced his death was homicide, primarily caused by the powerful anaesthetic Propofol.
The measure is aimed at cutting the number of government leaks which appear in the Israeli press.
In a memo, Cabinet Secretary Oved Yehezkel said mobiles and "other communication devices" would be returned to ministers after meetings.
Local reports say Mr Olmert berated a minister on Sunday for using his phone during a key intelligence briefing.
The unnamed minister was talking on his mobile while the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence service, Yuval Diskin, was telling the cabinet about sensitive security issues, according to AFP.
At a news conference after the cabinet meeting, a blackout was imposed on Mr Diskin's briefing.
Mr Olmert's press adviser said it had contained sensitive information "not meant to be exposed to the Israeli public or the Palestinians".
Agency reports suggest it is not unknown for senior Israeli officials to call reporters and leave their mobile phone running during meetings, so journalists can hear what is going on.
Sources from the prime minister's office say the ban on mobiles is one of a series of recommendations from a commission which the cabinet secretary intends to impose strictly.

At the end of last year a hacker claimed he had defeated the protection on a number of HD-DVD titles, leading to fears the entire system was broken.
But the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) Licensing Authority has said the breach is limited.
"It does not represent an attack on the AACS system itself," the group said.
The AACS group has admitted that a hacker had managed to decrypt some discs and other people were now able to make copies of certain titles.
A spokesman for the AACS group said the large size of the files and the high cost of writable hi-def discs made widespread copying of the movies impractical.
The attacks on the new format echo the early days of illegal trafficking in music files, AACS spokesman Michael Ayers said.
AACS copy protection is used on both HD-DVD and Blu-ray titles, giving rise to concern from the entire movie industry about the security of its content.
A large-scale breach of AACS could be a threat to the $24bn DVD industry and dent hopes that high-definition discs would invigorate the market.
The hacker obtained the keys from "one or more" pieces of software which plays high-definition DVDs, said Mr Ayers.
But the AACS group would not identify them or say whether their AACS licensing would be revoked.
"We certainly have not ruled out any particular response and we will take whatever action is appropriate," Mr Ayers said.
In a recent interview with digital media website Slyck, hacker muslix64, said his motivation for defeating the protection system was frustration.
He said he had grown angry when a HD-DVD movie he had bought would not play on his monitor because it did not have the compliant connector demanded by the movie industry.
As part of the copy protection system on high-definition DVD, content providers can insist that movies will only play correctly if there are HDMI - or in some specific cases, compliant DVI - ports on the player and screen as these two connectors can handle the HDCP copy protection system.
"Not being able to play a movie that I have paid for, because some executive in Hollywood decided I cannot, made me mad," said the hacker.
Dennis has strong views on what he describes as the "poison" that could have killed him.
And he agrees with the Commons health select committee's call for minimum pricing of alcohol.
The select committee, chaired by Labour MP Kevin Barron, says that setting a minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol, to curb excessive drinking in England, could save more than 3,000 lives a year.
Dennis used to live here, but having stopped drinking he now has his own place.
He is not the only one here with strong views on regulating alcohol.
"I wish the bosses of these companies who make the super-strength drinks would actually come down and see the damage that their alcohol does," Maz, 48, adds.
Graham House is a warm and welcoming hostel - with a whiff of alcohol.
Jeremy Swain, the chief executive of Thames Reach, thinks it would be counterproductive to ban people from drinking here - most residents are alcoholics, and they would be on the street in the snow if they were not allowed in with a can.
Mr Swain is campaigning for minimum pricing of alcohol per unit to make sure super-strength, and super-cheap, alcohol is no longer quite so cheap.
He has lobbied MPs and questioned the drinks industry and he welcomes the select committee's recommendations.
But the government, the Conservatives and the drinks industry are not convinced minimum pricing is practical - or politically tenable.
Tennents has not responded to the BBC's requests for a comment but Brigid Simmonds of the British Beer and Pub Association said a minimum price "while undoubtedly well intentioned, it would be ineffective in practice".
MPs on the select committee accept their ideas are bold - and might be dismissed initially.
But chairman Kevin Barron says much the same was said about the committee's suggestion to ban smoking in public places not that many years ago.
For Mr Swain, at Thames Reach, it is time for ministers to act.
"We are not going to solve the problem without help from government because the super strength lagers are too attractive," he says.
When the 659 MPs have been chosen, the leader of the largest group (political party) gets asked to form a government.
The South African government said that US$500m more will be needed to host the tournament than originally thought.
"Current projections suggest we might be facing an escalation of cost," deputy finance minister Jabu Moleketi announced in Pretoria.
Moleketi said the government would work out how to finance the shortfall after a detailed cost calculation next month.
"We have dispatched all our technical teams to look into the projected escalation and put in extra capacity to interrogate on the spot the nature of the problem," he added.
Moleketi blamed a rise in steel prices for the escalation in costs.
"The price structures are changing every day because of intense demand of the materials," said the minister.
Moleketi was still confident however, that preparations are still on schedule and said this weekend's preliminary draw in Durban would illustrate the country's organisational skills.
"The 2010 government World Cup unit is convinced that the implementation of all plans are still on target and within (our) timelines," he said.
"The preliminary draw in Durban will demonstrate our ability not only to host the tournament in 2010, but our organisational capacity to host such events.
Championship leader Alonso insisted he had never thought about settling for second as he came under intense pressure from Schumacher's Ferrari in the closing laps.
"I was always hoping for the win," said the Spaniard, whose third victory in a row gave him an 18-point lead in the drivers' standings - and extended his lead over Schumacher to 26.
Schumacher had taken advantage of the distraction of backmarkers to snatch second place from BAR's Jenson Button earlier in the race.
And Alonso tried to avoid getting caught up in traffic as he duelled with the German for victory.
"In the last 10 laps I had a Red Bull and a Williams in front of me and I was hoping I wouldn't catch them," said Alonso.
"I thought maybe I would lose downforce and Michael could overtake me.
Jenson Button had a nervous six-hour wait before his third place was finally confirmed by the stewards after his car was weighed both with and without fuel.
"Immediately following the end of the race the car was weighed in the configuration it had finished and was above the minimum weight limit," the stewards said in a statement.
Button's podium was BAR's first of the season after three races without points.
Highlights - Turkish GP practice two
Webber, the world championship leader, suffered a suspected engine failure towards the end of the session.
McLaren's Lewis Hamilton led after the first session, but ended fourth while Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was fifth.
And Button said he, too, was optimistic of a strong race on Sunday, although he warned that challenging Red Bull would be difficult.
"Our car works well round here," said the 30-year-old.
"There are a few small things I want to sort out, but I'm reasonably happy with the balance and both tyres are working well.
"But we are still trying to chase Red Bull, who are yet to show their hand here, so don't get too excited by our pace.
"It was a normal Friday and important to get as much information and learn about the car because you don't catch up one second over a couple of weeks.

Nico Rosberg outperformed his Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher as the Germans finished sixth and seventh.
A number of drivers had problems at the triple-apex Turn Eight during the two 90-minute free practice sessions.
All the drivers struggled to cope with debris and dust on the racing line in the morning session, but as speeds increased in the afternoon practice, so too did the spin-offs.
Force India's Adrian Sutil walked away from a crash into the barriers at the end of session one but with his car patched up, returned to complete 16 laps in the afternoon and post the 11th quickest time.
Ferrari's Felipe Massa, who has won three of the five Formula 1 races held in Turkey, also left the track at the notoriously difficult corner on three occasions.
The third exit was the most costly for the Brazilian who destroyed one of the softer option tyres he was using in a bid to post a quick time and he had to settle for 10th fastest overall.
BMW Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi, Renault's Vitaly Petrov and Force India's Vitantonio Liuzzi were also among those caught out by the big left-hander.
However, with the session reaching its climax, Webber's car stopped as it was exiting Turn Two and the Australian was forced to freewheel backwards off the track with wisps of smoke coming out of the engine cover.
Red Bull are not too concerned about the incident, however, as they say the engine was nearing the end of its life.
"Mark's engine was right up at the end of its mileage," said team principal Christian Horner.
As Webber's car trundled back to safety, he was involved in a heated exchange with the marshals as the Australian tried to get out of the vehicle.
"I was telling them, just find some common sense," said Webber.
"There is no handbrake on an F1 car, so I was telling them to put something behind the wheel to stop the car rolling back.
The Red Bulls, who were expected to dominate, failed to match the speed of Button though.
The Englishman also eclipsed his morning time by more than one second to move above compatriot Hamilton, who, unusually, posted a slower time in the afternoon.

Mr Denham told Today presenter Evan Davis that he was unable to give an overall figure for spending on local government services in three years' time.
He said that councils should not seek to cut back on frontline services and that "efficiencies are the way forward", suggesting that they could save money by sharing buildings and reorganising their "back office" services.
The BBC's forecast, based on answers from 49 councils with a combined workforce of 256,000, suggest that they will face cuts of 10%.
Winfrey was paid $260m (�128m) between June 2006 and June 2007, Forbes said.
The second-placed star was comedian Jerry Seinfeld, whose earnings were put at $60m (�30m) for the past year.
Simon Cowell, the outspoken judge on American Idol, came third with $45m (�22m), while Jay Leno and Donald Trump also featured in the website's top 10.
And Forbes senior editor Lea Goldman said daytime personalities "dominate our list".
Winfrey is no stranger to the regular Forbes polls, having topped its most powerful celebrity list in June.
This survey takes into account stars' earnings, internet presence and press, TV and radio coverage.
Music mogul Cowell's overall fortune is now thought to be in the region of �100m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, a separate study which was released in April
His US reality TV hit, America's Got Talent, has been sold to 80 countries around the world.
Aside from American Idol, he also has a variety of TV projects run through his company Syco, as well as working as an executive for record company Sony BMG.
Seinfeld's haul was earned mostly from repeats of his self-titled 1990s sitcom, which he co-owned.
About 2,000 rebels are thought to be defending the city, which is under attack from several directions.
The Russians have deployed huge numbers of ground troops in the assault, and are calling in air strikes on Chechen positions whenever they encounter serious resistance.
Russian military commanders are predicting the onslaught will break the rebels and that the city will fall in days.
Late on Tuesday, fires were burning all over the city and a thick pall of smoke was blocking out the light.
The Russian military told the Itar-Tass news agency that fighting had continued unabated after nightfall.
It said federal forces were shelling Chechen positions from the high ground on the perimeter of the city.
A BBC correspondent reporting from Russian military headquarters in Mozdok says Grozny, which is systematically being ground to dust, has become a sniper's paradise - a wasteland of rubble and hollowed out buildings.
The Russian military says it now controls at least three districts and has dislodged Chechen fighters from their positions around Minutka Square in the city centre.
"The decisive phase of the liberation of Grozny has started," said Defence Ministry spokesman Konstantin Kukharenko.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has expressed renewed fears for the safety of thousands of civilians still trapped in Grozny, but says it is ''powerless'' to help.
The UN refugee agency said many of those stranded in Grozny were too old or too frail to leave, and were hiding in damp cellars hoping to survive the onslaught.
But UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said it was too dangerous to send in relief workers.
Russian warplanes have also struck the Vedeno and Argun gorges, which lead through rebel-held mountains in the south to the republic of Georgia, while helicopter gunships rocketed Grozny and southern towns still occupied by the separatist fighters.
The Russian paratroops commander said federal forces had blocked off all key towns and villages around the gorges.
Moscow moved troops into Chechnya last September after blaming separatist militants for incursions into Dagestan and bomb attacks in Russian cities.
While the islands' rugged coastlines and extensive bird life are a draw for some, the Faroes also offer the prospect of major offshore reserves of oil and gas.
These potential resources have given extra weight to the argument for full independence from Denmark.
But a planned referendum on the issue was shelved in 2001 after Denmark said it would halt aid within four years if voters favoured the independence proposals.
A local parliament - the Loegting - looks after the islands' affairs, although Copenhagen is responsible for defence and foreign relations.
Kaj Leo Johannesen of the Union Party became prime minister in September 2008, a week after the collapse of former prime minister Joannes Eidesgaard's coalition.
The prime minister has pledged to seek closer ties with Europe and to preserve the fishing sector, which is a major source of income for the country.
His centre-right, pro-Denmark Union Party and its coalition partner, the centre-right and pro-independence People's Party both received an increased share of the vote in elections in October 2011.
Mr Johannesen's predecessor, Joannes Eidesgaard, had stepped down after quarrels with his foreign minister and disagreements within the coalition.
The Faroes have traditionally been governed by coalitions.
He said the incident took place on Saturday but news was slow in being reported because of the inaccessibility of the region.
The jet was involved in operations against Taliban militants in the nearby Orakzai tribal region.
Officials have reportedly already paid compensation to families of victims.
The military insists most of those killed were militants, but local sources say many civilians have also been killed.
Many people have died in air strikes in the area over the past 18 months.
Villagers say another strike - by a US drone missile - killed 13 people on Monday.
Military spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas told Associated Press news agency on Monday that those killed in the Pakistan army air strike were attacked because it had intelligence that militants were gathering at the site.
He denied civilians had died and said the victims were initially reported to be suspected militants, AP said.
The BBC's Orla Guerin says an official claims that 73 civilians were killed
Those on the ground gave a different version of events.
"All those killed were innocent civilians," the local administration official told the BBC.
The official said he could not speak on the record as the military had put a "gagging order" on him to limit the fallout.
He said that initial information suggested that the jet had strayed away from the conflict zone and mistook the village for a militant compound.
Local officials have paid compensation amounting to more than $100,000 (£65,000) to the families of those killed, an unnamed official told the Associated Press news agency.
The BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says this is a strong indication that local authorities, at least, believe a tragic mistake has been made.
Police prevented a BBC correspondent from interviewing the injured at the Hayatabad medical complex in Peshawar.
Other reporters have also been denied access.
Correspondents say that the army is under heavy pressure from the US to move forcefully against Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in the north-west.
The army regularly reports killing militants in air strikes, but consistently denies it is responsible for civilian deaths.
Relief agencies say the offensives against militants in Pakistan and in neighbouring Afghanistan have displaced more than one million people.
Mark Ormrod explains his various prosthetic limbs
"My first thought when I saw him, I thought, he's not going to want to live like this, he's not going to survive this, " says Jackie Ormrod about the moment she first saw her son's injuries.
They were in a hospital room in Birmingham, just days after Royal Marine Mark Ormrod stepped on a landmine in the Afghan desert.
Even while he was lying in the middle of a minefield with catastrophic injuries, Mark says he always knew he would get out alive.
They are fabulous until you want to stop - "you have to find a convenient brick wall or tree branch to run into", Mark says.
The force is reviewing its structure, so some officers doing backroom jobs will be replaced by civilian staff.
As a result, by the end of the 2009/10 financial year there will be 30 fewer officers within the force.
However, restructuring will mean that an additional number of officers will be deployed to front line duties.
"These income streams are expected to come under greater pressure for the foreseeable future.
"Work has already started in our back office functions to make budget savings and be more efficient and effective.
"The constabulary at all times seeks to avoid compulsory redundancy by considering alternative approaches, controlling recruitment and redeployment, but this does present an increasingly difficult challenge.
The proposals will be presented to the governing body, the Cumbria Police Authority, on 17 February.
The girls, two aged 17 and one 16, were convicted of false imprisonment and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.
Inner London Crown Court heard the victim, now 18, was stripped, punched and kicked while the attack was filmed.
It took place in a flat in Woolwich, south-east London, in March 2006.
Judge Colin Smith told them that a particularly unpleasant and increasingly common feature of the victim's ordeal was that it was video-recorded on at least one mobile phone.
During the boy's ordeal he was subjected to a "sudden severe physical assault", made to strip naked and forced to perform a sex act in front of the group.
The court heard that in a recording the boy could be seen being forced to sit in a cold bath while ketchup and kitchen oil was poured over him as he begged for mercy.
"One can tell, listening to that video, that the ordeal was being played out to a background of extremely loud screaming and laughing by the group," the judge said.
After several hours the boy managed to escape, with some of his clothes, and went to his ex-girlfriend's mother's house.
He had red marks on his face, was bleeding from one ear and a doctor's examination revealed extensive bruising all over his body.
One of the 17-year-olds, said to be the ringleader, received a four-year detention order.
The 16-year-old was given three years' detention and the other 17-year-old was given a two-year detention and training order.
The trio, who cannot be named because of their age, were found guilty of false imprisonment and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent on 9 August.
One of the girls pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm and the other two were found guilty of the same charge.
Mr Richards had stood down temporarily from the leadership in order to fight an allegation of causing grievous bodily harm to a young woman.
His choice of deputy leader, 29-year-old Monmouth Assembly Member David Davies, was rejected by the other Tory AMs, who thought him too inexperienced, and when that happened, Mr Richards made his resignation permanent.
If no further nominations have been received for the leadership by Wednesday, then Mr Bourne will become the new leader of the Tories in the Assembly.
Mr Bourne had previously challenged Rod Richards for the leadership of the Conservatives in Wales, losing to him in a ballot of the members.
Educated at University of Wales, Aberystwyth and Trinity College, Cambridge, Mr Bourne was formerly, the Conservatives_ Chief Spokesman in Wales.
He led the No campaign against the setting up of the National Assembly in 1997, but after the vote went in favour of devolution, he became a member of the National Assembly Advisory Group.
He is a barrister and an author, and his political interests are the economy, foreign affairs, health and education.
Sharp criticism has been levelled at the security forces and ultra-conservative vigilante groups, with general agreement that Thursday's raid on a university hostel was indefensible.
The role of the hardline Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilante grouping in the unrest was still in dispute on Sunday.
According to the conservative daily Tehran Times, the Hezbollah grouping exacerbated the tension created by the "amicable but illegal" student demonstrations on Thursday night.
"The inappropriate interference of Ansar-e Hezbollah and the incompetence of the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) complicated the situation," the paper said.
A contradictory commentary on Iranian radio said Ansar-e Hezbollah had denied any involvement in the clashes at the university hostel.
"Over the past few days, the foreign media has feverishly attempted to involve the Ansar-e Hezbollah in the incident by calling it a pressure group.
"In a statement, the Ansar-e Hezbollah expressed regret over the dormitory incident and appealed to the legal organs and officials to carry out a thorough investigation and punish the perpetrators," the radio said.
Iran's National Security Council said in a statement at the week-end that a special team had been appointed to investigate the unrest and "firmly deal with the pressure groups which are a cause of many difficulties because of their illegal actions".
The Tehran Times said the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) had proven incapable of handling "complicated political issues" .
"The Tehran Times recently experienced the immature approach of the LEF," the English-language daily said.
"Breaching the perimeters of science and knowledge stems only from a lack of insight and only helps political groups attain their goals," the report added.
Meanwhile, the ultra-conservative daily Kayhan International condemned the security forces' handling of the student protests as "irresponsible" .
"A peaceful demand, although illegal, should not be answered with a physical assault.
That is not civilised behaviour," the paper said.
The pro-reform daily Iran criticised those who blamed political violence entirely on meddling by "foreign elements" .
The paper attacked the "new hypocrites" who were undermining the gains of the Islamic revolution.
"Why is it that those who are always `beating on the drum of Islam' fail to see that they are standing against their `own comrades' and why can't they see that the opposition camp, which is also Muslim, might also speak the truth?" Iran asked.
"The Muslim nation is determined to identify and frustrate the line of hypocrisy and violence which has taken refuge among the secret and visible pressure groups," the paper added.
Another pro-reform daily, Iran News, launched a scathing attack on Iranian national TV's coverage of the unrest.
The paper accused Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) of adopting "a partisan stance in its news coverage in the past three days" and of "refraining from broadcasting pictures and reports about the student protests" .
The paper said IRIB had "shied away from its sole mission, which is to disseminate information to the public, whose members have been witnessing the events at Tehran University campus" .
However, Iranian TV did show Interior Minister Abdolvahed Musavi-Lari being heckled by students at a Tehran hostel on Friday.

They had stiff competition from Beyonce, who stormed in at number two with her single Baby Boy.

Dido's still at number one there, and there was a new entry from an old favourite.
Elvis Presley's new compilation album, 2nd to None, came in at, erm, four.
Last night millions of tons of snow, rocks, mud and debris tumbled down the extinct volcano of Huascaran, Peru's highest mountain in the Andes range.
Relief efforts are being hampered by the very storms that started the devastating landslide, but there are believed to be few survivors.
Colonel Umberto Ampuera, head of emergency services, said the disaster was "like a scene from Dante's Inferno".
He appealed to the Peruvian Government for aid to restore stricken communications and reach anyone who escaped the landslide.
Two Peruvian Air Force planes have carried relief supplies to the area and troops have been sent there to open up roads to Ranrahica and other areas cut off by the avalanche.
Bodies have been found at the port of Chimbote, 60 miles from the scene of the tragedy, where the river meets the sea.
The President of the Peruvian Red Cross, Roberto Thorndike, estimated between 2,000 and 2,500 people were killed.
But local authorities believe the death toll is higher - between 3,000 and 4,000 people.
The region is prone to major avalanches at this time of year when glaciers melt and break off sliding through the "quebracas" (deep canyons) in the valley below.
U Thant, the acting United Nations Secretary General, has offered Peru aid to alleviate the situation.
In a telegram to President Manuel Prado he said representatives of the UN technical assistance board and the UN children's fund would be ready to give any help required of them.
The 1962 avalanche that caused so much devastation in the Rio Santa Valley was eclipsed in 1970 by another massive landslide.
On 31 May a huge earthquake 25km (15 miles) from the town of Chimbote, on the north coast of Peru, triggered off Latin America's biggest recorded landslide.
A wall of ice was dislodged from Mount Huascaran and in three minutes slid down a glacier and travelled another 10km (six miles) to bury the town of Yungay.
The crisis began on 28 September when nine staff of the Spaghetti House chain gathered to collect the week's takings amounting to almost �13,000.
Commander Christopher Payne ordered them out one by one and the Italians emerged tentatively before collapsing into the arms of police and being taken by ambulance to hospital for check-ups.
The Metropolitan Police had taken a hardline but tactful approach to the situation.
It had dismissed the group's claim it was part of a Black Panther splinter group, the Black Liberation Army, fighting against capitalism and the oppression of black people.
After referring to Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Sir Robert Mark, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had refused their demands for a plane and safe passage to Jamaica.
But the group had been given a radio, coffee and cigarettes in exchange for the release of two hostages who were unwell.
The freed hostages were Mario Roscelli, Enrico Mainini, Gino Barni, his brother Bruno, Renato Nasta and Giovanni Scrano.
Two of the gunmen who are West Indian - Wesley Dick, aged 24 and Anthony Gordon Munroe, aged 22 - have been charged at Cannon Row Police Station.
Davies, a 28-year-old Nigerian student, is being questioned at St George's Hospital.
The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, has sent a telegram to Sir Robert praising him for the successful handling of the siege, the first of its kind in Britain.
At a news conference at Scotland Yard, Sir Robert paid tribute to the 400 officers who worked on securing the safe release of the hostages.
He also praised Italian Consul General Mario Manca whom he described as "a sensitive, gallant and truly unselfish man" and presented him with a mounted crest of the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Police.
At the height of the siege, Mr Manca had offered himself as a substitute for one of the hostages who was taken ill and then released.
Sir Robert also thanked the hostages and their relatives for their patience and fortitude, and also the press for their careful reporting of the situation.
They had also worked with the news media to demoralise the gunmen by broadcasting radio reports saying there was no chance of them getting any concessions from the authorities.
One of the Italian hostages helped to break through the atmosphere of tension and mutual distrust and began a friendship with ringleader Franklin Davies.
After the siege had ended he even visited him in prison in the weeks leading up the trial and was allowed not to testify against him.
Davies was jailed for 22 years, Dick for 18 years and Munroe for 17 years for attempted robbery, having firearms with intent to rob and imprisoning eight hostages.
In the saddle, the Irishman's greatest triumph was in partnership with Dawn Run, the only horse to have won both the Champion Hurdle and the Gold Cup.
He also guided Sea Pigeon to victory in the Champion Hurdle and to Flat glory in the Tote Ebor and had another Gold Cup win on Alverton.
Twice champion jockey, he retired with 885 winners and then came through his biggest battle - with cancer.
His first big winner as a trainer came with Gipsy Fiddler at Royal Ascot in 1990.
A Cheltenham winner in the shape of Danny Connors followed a year later.
His first decade as a trainer saw him based at Penrith in Cumbria.
But in 2001 one of his main owners, JP McManus, installed him in the famous training establishment of Jackdaws Castle in Gloucestershire.
His career has really taken off since then and last season he reached the century mark for winners for the first time.

There are not enough secure homes for children who have committed offences, according to the education watchdog Ofsted.
Ofsted's John Goldup analyses whether that means they are not getting the support and education they need.
Arcangel de Jesus Henao Montoya was seized along with a number of others near the border with Colombia, said Panamanian police chief Carlos Bares.
He is wanted in the US - and the US Drugs Enforcement Agency was involved in his capture, the police chief said.
Mr Henao Montoya is suspected of being a leader of the Norte de Valle cartel, based in the Colombian city of Cali.
Last month, Colombian police said they had arrested Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, another suspected senior member of the cartel who is also wanted in the United States.
Police arrested Mr Henao Montoya's brother, Diego Leon Montoya, at about the same time.
Local newspapers reported that Mr Leon Montoya, Mr Henao Montoya and two other Norte de Valle kingpins had earlier offered to surrender to Colombian authorities in exchange for a promise that they would not be extradited to the United States.
Mr Henao Montoya was arrested in the southern Panama city of Torti early on Saturday and taken by police to the capital, Panama City, along with several others.
Police chief Carlos Bares said his capture had been "difficult work".
"This is a significant achievement in the fight against drug trafficking," he said.
Mr Henao Montoya's Norte de Valle organisation is thought to have taken control of segments of the international cocaine market left open by the deaths of leaders in the dominant Cali Cartel in the mid-1990s.
The Cali Cartel rose to dominate the international cocaine and heroin market after the death of drugs kingpin Pablo Escobar in 1993.
Colombia remains the world's largest producer of cocaine and a major supplier of heroin to the US.
Tensions also rose following a UN Security Council vote on Saturday to impose harsher sanctions on Iran over the country's nuclear programme.
"Some political risk premium is coming back into oil prices," said Andrew Harrington at ANZ Global Resources.
The rise pushes oil to its highest level this year.
Iran, which is the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, said the UK naval personnel were arrested on Friday in its territorial waters.
UK and US officials have denied this account, with Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair calling their detention "unjustified and wrong".
"The situation in the Middle East has become much more uncertain and the risk of tensions intensifying has underpinned the rise in oil prices," said David Moore at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Prices were also pushed up following reports of problems at the fifth largest refinery in the US, owned by BP, in Indiana.
Additionally, oil traders are worried about the situation in Nigeria, where three abducted foreigners are still missing.
One Dutch citizen was abducted in Nigeria's oil capital Port Harcourt, while two Chinese nationals were kidnapped nine days ago in the south-eastern state of Anambra.
But he added he did not think his habit was "getting in the way of my life in any way".
"I'm a happy man and I can afford my marijuana so that's not a problem," he told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.
Michael has previously said the world would be an "easier place to live with" if cannabis was legal.
In the Radio 4 interview, he also urged listeners to support troubled singer Amy Winehouse, who he called "the best female vocalist" he had ever heard.
He chose a track by Winehouse - who has reportedly had her own drug problems - as one of his castaway discs, saying she was also "one of the best writers" he had come across.
Michael touched on a wide variety of subjects during his interview with presenter Kirsty Young.
Talking about his 25th anniversary tour, he said it had been "a very bizarre year".
"You can't imagine what it's like playing to people who have been loyal to you for 25 years and haven't seen you for 15.
He described his childhood, revealing he believes he only became a pop star because he suffered a bang on the head.
"At the age of about eight I had a head injury and I know it sounds bizarre and unlikely, but it was quite a bad bang," he said.
"I had it stitched up and stuff, but all my interests changed, everything changed in six months.
"I had been obsessed with insects and creepy crawlies, I used to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out into this field behind our garden and collect insects before everyone else got up.
"Suddenly, all I wanted to know about was music, it just seemed a very, very strange thing.
"And I have a theory that maybe it was something to do with this accident, this whole left-brain right-brain thing.
The interview aired on Sunday, and is repeated on Friday at 0902 BST.
Key ministers and workers' representatives had been in talks for several days in an effort to arrive at an agreement.
Unions representing affected workers have welcomed the move, calling it a "victory for pensions justice and trade unionism".
I would like to congratulate the government on its proposed compensation scheme for workers robbed of their pension.
The government advised people to pay into company pensions.
The compensation should come from the government, not from the pension companies as that would affect the people paying into their own pensions without company help.
Members of final-salary schemes that were wound up but their companies remained solvent lost out in exactly the same way as companies that went into liquidation.
I had my deferred pension promise of �6800 pa wound up by my former employer who is still solvent.
The �400 million is a knee jerk reaction to stop a backbench revolt over the Pension Protection Fund.
Under the flawed 1995 Pensions Act it is a legal requirement that my husband's pension - accumulated over more than 20 years - be taken in its entirety and used to subsidise the pensions of those in his scheme who have already retired, leaving him with nothing whatsoever.
Poor performance on the stock market is not only to blame, the government is also responsible.
Should we not be looking at the pensions industry itself, the actuaries and consultants which were employed by the trustees?
I have a money purchase scheme, which means all the risk is placed on my pension fund.
I cannot really see any sort of pension scheme where risk is not involved, whether to the company or to its members.
I was made redundant at 50 years of age, and then had an uncertain future made even worse when I lost 90 % of my promised pension, through no fault of my own when the company went into liquidation.
I was encouraged by successive governments to make provision for my retirement - which I did - and nowhere did it say there was a risk involved in this investment.
I was lead by the government, the NAPF, OPAS, OPRA, my employer, trade unions and the media, to believe that my pension was detached from the company, protected by law and guaranteed.
In reality, now my employer has gone bust, I find they all lied.
At the age of 60 I find my pension has vanished, and despite full time employment for 40 years I will have to rely on the state.
The state misled us all, the state should pay.
The taxpayer may be bailing out these people, but nothing to what we pay for those who are unemployed, or are sick, or in prison.
Also, is the taxpayer not being asked to cover the �400 billion plus black hole that is currently facing the public sector pensions?
The final salary fund is presently under funded and our pensions from this source will be a fraction of those promised to us when the scheme was wound up.
The government's complicity and reluctance to correct the matter really upsets current and future pensioners.
During the 80s and 90s in agreement with, indeed, as guided by, the government, my firm took payment holidays as the pension fund performance was so good.
We have spent considerable sums of our own money chasing this matter through the ombudsman, trying to gain a ruling to force our firm to make good the damage done by taking these payment holidays.
Public money should not HAVE to be used in this way.
But it is a failing of British legislation that company pension funds are not ring-fenced, as fund-members' property to which the employer has no entitlement.
As a general rule, the employee's contribution is taken from his nominal salary and the employer undertakes to make contributions on the employee's behalf.
The winding-up of the company should in no way lead automatically to the winding-up of the fund.
Putting it crudely, the company's creditors have a right to company assets but not to my pension, which is an asset in which the employees (fund-members) have a stake, not the company.
That works out to about �333 per year, which seems derisory.
Whilst I have every sympathy for those who have lost their pensions, listening to the man who wants his pension reinstated in full is going too far.
It is not my fault as a tax payer that this has happened, bad management and world economics may have contributed but not me.
Am I, as a taxpayer now underwriting every pension scheme in the country?

This model has a more angular, robotic look than its predecessors, which Sony has tried to make as animal-like as possible.
The robot is due to go on sale in late November.
The robot can also recognise more spoken commands than its predecessors.
By contrast the generation of Aibos released before the ERS-220, called Latte and Macaron, were much more rounded and looked more like real animals.
At the same time, Sony is releasing software packs that can change the temperament of the electronic pet.
The Navigator 2 software pack lets owners see the world through the digital camera inside an Aibo's nose and lets the robot be controlled via a wireless data link at a distance of up to 90 metres (295 feet).
The Explorer pack turbocharges the robot and makes it produce a stream of sounds and exaggerated movements.
Europeans who want to snap up an ERS-220 can order them from 12 November for 1,800 euros (�1,105).
Sinn Fein is the only one of the four main parties in the province which has refused to take up its seats, as it does not endorse police reforms.
The Policing Board replaces the Northern Ireland Police Authority and its role is to scrutinise the chief constable and the running of the force.
Vice-chairman of the board Denis Bradley, who had a mediation role in pre-ceasefire contacts, said a detailed blueprint for a new policing force was already on the statue books.
The former priest from Londonderry also said there was a "great willingness" to change among senior police officers.
Police reform has been one of the most difficult issues facing the peace process.
However, the decision by the two main unionist parties to join the Police Board last month was a breakthrough in resolving the issue.
The nationalist SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Democratic Unionists have now joined the board.
Its first meeting is expected to take place in the next few weeks.
The Policing Board is made up of 10 politicians and nine independent members.
The SDLP was the first of the parties to join it followed by the UUP and DUP.
Former director of the US Drug Enforcement Agency Tom Constantine was appointed police oversight commissioner in May 2000.
His job is to measure how policing reforms, which are part of the Good Friday Agreement, are implemented against the legislation that was passed.
The first batch of between 260-300 Police Service of Northern Ireland trainees - selected on a 50% Catholic 50% Protestant basis - began training in October and be on the streets by spring 2002.
Over the past three weekends officers have been patrolling the town's centre after a rise in drink-related crime.
Police say Operation Reclaim has had a positive effect and violent crime has been reduced as a direct result.
The scheme will now be extended for a further two weeks.
"Wrexham town is a safe place to visit and the intention will always be to make it even safer," said Inspector Chris Beasley from North Wales Police.
During the operation's first weekend 27 people were arrested for violence and disorder.
During the second weekend a total of 21 people were arrested and police introduced a water hose to persuade people caught urinating in the street to clean up their own mess.
However, by the third weekend the figures were dramatically reduced and just five people were arrested.
"Staring defeat in the eye, Mugabe has decided to play his last card, that of resorting to fiction in an attempt to demonise the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai," it said.
The Standard, which reflects opposition opinion, said the public was not convinced by President Mugabe's focus on the "remote issue" of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, whom he accuses of practising colonialism.
Mr Mugabe has also accused Mr Tsvangirai - his chief rival - of plotting a coup.
The paper noted that other candidates were attacking Mr Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, as if he were the incumbent president.
The public, said The Standard, would vote according to who seemed most likely to solve the food shortage and return Zimbabwe to the rule of law and order.
According to The Standard, the government ordered election observers to stay 100 metres away from polling stations, in order to "reduce overcrowding".
The paper also said that Zimbabweans returning from South Africa to vote had been turned back at the Beitbridge border crossing and told to fix their residence status.
The chief immigration officer at Beitbridge, David Chitsaka, denied the report, saying that the South African press was creating such stories to discredit the Zimbabwean immigration authorities.
Government-controlled ZBC 3FM radio said Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede had warned people who renounced Zimbabwean citizenship "not to create problems at polling stations by attempting to vote".
Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo praised voters for their responsible behaviour, according to the radio.
"Zimbabweans have demonstrated to the international community that they are capable of organising their own elections in a peaceful manner," he said.
BBC Isle of Man's Sarah Corker looks back at what happened to the Steam Packet Company's Mona's Queen at Dunkirk in 1940
The Mona's Queen was one of three Steam Packet company ships lost during the Dunkirk landings in 1940.
Her anchor was recovered near France in June and is being restored at Cammell Laird ship yard.
Sarah Corker has been finding out what will happen to the historical relic when it finally returns to the island.
The owner of the laugh and twinkle in their eye? None other than Dame Kelly Holmes.
And Holmes knows a thing or two about pain.
A series of injuries saw her agonisingly miss out on a number of potential medals, until of course those ghosts were laid to rest at the Athens Olympics last year.
On the latest leg of the Norwich Union Camp Kelly initiative - she is mentoring a group of aspiring female middle-distance runners - a select group of "athletic machines" were invited to the place where in 1986 she began honing her physical and mental skills.
All seemed tranquil as BBC Sport's lowly-ranked Private Guinea Pig approached Pirbright Barracks in Surrey, just two weeks after agreeing to a "gentle work-out" on the assault course with an Olympic superstar.
The distant sound of gunfire at the security gate and the sight of a bunch of anxious new recruits sporting newly shaven scalps was unsettling, but the nerves held firm.
Until, that is, Kelly's welcoming speech.
Aged 18, she turned her back on athletics - albeit temporarily - to start training at this very camp and, donning her combat trousers and gleaming black boots, she looked intent on giving us a sharp lesson.
She called it "character building".
As we laced up our boots and squeezed into the army suits, Holmes reminded us what more than nine years of hard graft in the army had taught her.
"It's all about looking at the determination you need to be an athlete," she said.
With the army instructor's voice ringing in my ears, the assault course beckoned.
I was not just looking to complete it, I wanted to conquer it, to prove to my colleagues - maybe the world - that training as a top athlete was a doddle.
My face paint was still wet and already I was hearing these words.
Classic comedy capers ensued and more ear bashing for the newly crowned King of the Swingers.
It is easy to be blas� about such clich�s, but scrambling over a brick wall at the end of 10 minutes of gut-busting exercise and hearing "Right you horrible lot, now do it again" proved an unbelievable test of character.
Not to mention the sudden realisation that I was one false move away from getting a glimpse of my breakfast again and my old friend Barry the Blister had just popped up on my palm to pass on his good wishes.
My legs had turned to stone, my inner demons were screaming "stop right now, you idiot" and I just wanted to collapse on the spot, curl up under the nearest tree and request the presence of my mummy.
And that is the difference between mediocrity and winning medals.
We were left bruised, beaten and battered, and as we stood wobbling at the finish, gasping for air like goldfish out of water, we looked up to see Holmes flying over the remaining obstacles like a 14-year-old.
"I really enjoyed that," she announced.
"If you are going to be a champion you've probably already got it within you," she added comfortingly.
Kelly Holmes knew the answer nearly 20 years ago, but only now is she truly reaping the rewards.
Catch up with the best of Tuesday's action in the second round of the Carling Cup, including Leeds United's 2-1 win at home to Watford.
Crow will represent her country in Athens before returning home to serve a jail sentence for double manslaughter.
On 16 February 2003, Crow was driving her then boyfriend Cody Tatro - a teacher - and one of his pupils, 12-year-old Brett Slinger, to Dodge Ridge Ski Resort in California.
Whatever the outcome in the water in Athens, Crow will have to serve a three-month prison sentence on her return to the United States after pleading no contest to two counts of vehicular manslaughter.
Crow says she will be swimming with both Tatro and Slinger's spirits when she takes on the world's best.
Crow broke her arm in four places in the accident and had 11 screws and a titanium plate put in it during surgery.
The news of the accident was broken to her by a social worker as she sat in a hospital bed.
Her recovery has been astonishing considering the physical and mental scars of last year's accident.
While her team-mates have welcomed the decision to allow her to compete, there has been a potent mixture of support and outrage at the decision from others.
Her chances of competing at the Olympics looked virtually non-existent when Sonora Deputy District Attorney Jim Newkirk pursued criminal charges against her for the deaths of Tatro and Slinger.
At the heart of his complaint was the fact Crow had been drinking at a party the previous night and had had just two hours sleep.
Highway patrolman Rick Thoma, who was first on the scene of the accident, smelled alcohol on her breath but, when a blood alcohol test was taken three-and-a-half hours later, no alcohol was found in her bloodstream.
In the end, a police investigation concluded Crow had been driving too fast in the snowy conditions.
She duly received her sentence, which included a $22,000 retribution to Slinger's parents, who opposed the judge's decision to allow Crow to delay her jail term.
Despite Crow saying she will be swimming in memory of the deceased, Slinger's parents have asked her not to.
However, she has the support of Tatro's family.
Come August, Crow aims to repay that faith.
The pair, ranked ninth in the world, beat Chris Adcock and Gabby White 21-18 16-21 21-17 in the English National Championships final in Manchester.
"We know the level we have got to be at and it has got to be higher than we reached this weekend," said Robertson.
It was 33-year-old Robertson's sixth mixed doubles title and he is hoping to better the Olympic silver he won with Gail Emms seven years ago when he competes in London in 2012.
Both Wallwork and Robertson followed up their victory by winning in the women's and men's doubles finals respectively.
Wallwork, who needed treatment on a leg muscle injury ahead of the finals, teamed up with White to see off Heather Olver and Mariana Agathangelou 21-7 21-17, while Robertson paired with Chris Langridge in a 21-12 21-17 win over Adcock and Andy Ellis.
Robertson's win in the men's doubles was unexpected, as he was not even entered in the event at the start of the championships.
Langridge was due to partner nine-times winner Anthony Clark but a freak injury to the latter - struck in the eye by a shuttlecock in training - led to Robertson stepping in at the last moment.
Robertson has now won the men's doubles title four years in succession and nine times overall, while Langridge was victorious for the first time.
The world number 15 was rarely troubled as he overcame Canadian-born Baxter for the third successive year, winning in 33 minutes.
Baker is believed to have died from natural causes at his home in California's Sherman Oaks on Friday, studio spokesman Howard Green said.
His greatest moment came when he was nominated for an Oscar for the 1972 children's drama Napoleon and Samantha.
Visitors to Disney theme parks will also have heard many works written or arranged by Baker.
The composer wrote the incidental music on theattractions Great Moments With Mr Lincoln, It's a Small World, and The Haunted Mansion.
Baker often took others' melodies such as the Mickey Mouse Club March or the It's a SmallWorld song and adapted them for use elsewhere in a show or ride.
"Anyone who has ever been to a Disney theme park has enjoyed his music and his scores," said Roy Disney,vice-chairman of the Walt Disney company.
Brought up in Springfield, Illinois, Baker found an aptitude for music early in childhood.
After studying music at Missouri's Southwest Baptist University, Baker moved to Los Angeles in 1938 to work in Hollywood.
The budding composer wrote arrangements for radio programmes featuring Bob Hope, Jack Benny and Eddie Cantor.
In 1954, he was hired by Disney Studios, where he worked on arrangements for the TV show Davy Crockett and three Winnie the Pooh cartoons.
He also composed music for the scores of movies including 1960's Toby Tyler, 1975's The Apple Dumpling Gang and 1976's The ShaggyDA.
Reporters on the scene in Los Angeles will build an alternative picture of the night with minute-by-minute coverage.

It takes the threat of a major shake-up in education to concentrate the mind.
The publication of the challenging document known unofficially as the Burns Report has kicked off an unprecedented discussion on the future of post-primary education in Northern Ireland.
A team led by former ombudsman Gerry Burns drew up the proposals.
They originally thought that having reached unanimous agreement among their group the wider population would soon see the virtues of the package.
Some of the issues have caused much disquiet.
About a third of the pupils go to grammar schools, with the rest going to secondary schools.
The vast majority of those in grammar schools are from non-manual working backgrounds.
The majority in secondary schools are from manual backgrounds.
The Burns package would alter the power base of the grammar schools.
The grammar schools are told they can remain specialist schools for the academically gifted, but if they are forced to take in all abilities, they will have to change their teaching approach.
Secondary schools are broadly in favour of the changes, because they feel grammar schools are poaching the best, and more recently, even the middle-range pupils.
But even those schools are concerned that the collegiate system is unwieldy and unworkable.
The consultation will continue until the end of June, and it is now predicted that the Burns proposals will not be accepted in their entirety.
From a starting position of the Burns team saying there should be no "cherry picking", it now looks as though most of their proposals are open to amendment.
This may be the only way to reach the consensus necessary for major changes to go ahead.
That's according to research which has shown that how overweight you are is determined when you are very young.
And experts reckon that the problem is getting worse, as kids are fatter than they were 25 years ago.
The health experts behind the study say that we need to take a new approach to keeping fit.
At the moment lots of attention is put on making sure children are healthy while they are at school, but that might not be as useful as we think.
Instead, the experts want children to eat more healthily and take lots of exercise before they start primary school.
What you weigh when you're five years old has an effect on what you will weigh when you're nine, according to the study, and it seems girls are more likely to gain weight at an early age than boys.
Experts reckon the extra weight gained is because of too much food and not enough activity before you go to school.
She may be blond-haired, blue-eyed and extremely photogenic but she is a world-class skier, too.
The back pages of the British newspapers revelled in her 11th place finish in the Olympic downhill, which was the best result by a British female since the 1968 Games in Grenoble, France.
Alcott could not quite match the feat in the super-G but still finished inside the top 20 at San Sicario on Monday.
Her performances and obvious charm have done her public profile no harm and Alcott is revelling in her new-found fame.
Before the 2006 Games she had hooded sweatshirts with her name on made primarily for her family and friends, but she has now been inundated by enquires from new fans.
Alcott is rooming in the athletes' village with the other big British female star of the Games, Shelley Rudman, who won the silver medal in the skeleton.
"With Shelley winning a medal it's been great and I was so excited to touch my first Olympic medal," said the 23-year-old.
But with one event still to come in the giant slalom in Sestriere on Friday, Alcott could not join in the celebrations after Rudman's performance - and she did not even stir when her room-mate came back to the room in the early hours.
"I still have to be focused so I've been in bed early and have not even had a chance to go to the disco yet," Alcott said.
"It has been an amazing season and it is now my goal to get to Are to cap it off," she added.
A State Security Service spokesman said men in three states were detained and explosive-making devices were found.
Nigeria has not suffered a terrorist attack and despite occasional arrests of suspected Islamic militants there is no evidence of al-Qaeda in Nigeria.
In September, the US embassy warned Nigeria is at risk of a terror attack.
The SSS said the men had suspected links to the al-Qaeda network and the Nigerian Taleban.
However, over the last few years the Nigerian authorities have detained many suspected militants yet have failed to produce any substantive evidence of an al-Qaeda presence or terrorist plot in the country and there's never been a terrorist attack here.
The Nigerian Taleban have nothing to do with the Taleban in Afghanistan.
They were initially a group of Islamic university students who raided a few police stations in north-eastern Nigeria in 2003.
Almost all were hunted down and killed by the Nigerian army.
There are some radical Islamic sects who exist in the effectively borderless arid areas where northern Nigeria meets Chad and Niger.
Given that Nigeria is a major oil producer yet its population is poor and equally split between Muslims and Christians, British and American officials have long been obsessed that Nigeria was ripe for al-Qaeda-style groups.
It is not clear if these arrests will give any substance to those fears.
Discussions so far have focused on preserving the paper's editorial independence, with its main investors - the Bancroft family - taking the lead.
But Dow Jones said its board would now head discussions over the bid and "other strategic alternatives".
Analysts suggested the move could lead to a quicker resolution of the deal.
But, in a statement, Dow Jones said that it and the Bancroft family - which controls voting rights in the firm - would still have to be satisfied that the paper would remain independent under new owners.
"Representatives of the Bancroft family reiterated that any transaction must include appropriate provisions with respect to journalistic and editorial independence and integrity," the company said.
Since making its surprise bid for Dow Jones in May, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has sought to reassure sceptics that the paper's independence would be maintained.
Many observers expect a counter-bid for Dow Jones from another media firm, with Pearson - publisher of the Financial Times - being seen as a likely candidate.
Philadelphia Media Holdings, the owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, has also claimed it is interested in mounting a rival bid.
In an unprecedented move, the Swiss banking giant has also agreed to hand over the identities and account information of certain US clients.
UBS was accused of conspiring to create sham accounts to hide clients' assets.
In light of the bank's acknowledging responsibility, the Justice Department recommended dismissing the charge.
The deal was agreed in a federal court in Florida.
Switzerland has strict bank secrecy laws but the country's financial regulator ordered UBS to hand over some client data to the US government.
"I didn't join the club to wait forever because I left a very good midfield at Galatasaray, which included Hagi, where I played every week.
"When I moved to Scotland I realised it would take time to settle and get to know the other players in the team so I did not expect to walk into the first team straight away.
Tugay insisted he would not walk out on his three-year contract without trying to impress coach Dick Advocaat.
"I feel positive that I will get the chance next season to show theRangers fans just exactly what I can do, but at the end of the day it comes down to whether or not the coach selects me," he said.
Irina Cornici, 23, died after being starved and chained to a cross at a secluded convent in the north-east.
The ritual in 2005 was led by Daniel Petru Corogeanu, 31, the priest at the Holy Trinity convent in Tanacu village.
Nicoleta Arcalianu got eight years, while Adina Cepraga, Elena Otel and Simona Bardana were given five-year sentences.
All the defendants plan to appeal against the verdict in a case which has shocked Romania.
The Orthodox Church, which described the Tanacu incident as "abominable", has promised reforms, including psychological tests for those seeking to enter monasteries.
It banned Corogeanu from the priesthood and excommunicated the four nuns.
In 1999, when the Vatican issued its first new guidelines since 1614 for driving out devils, it urged priests to take modern psychiatry into account in deciding who should be exorcised.
Dozens of Corogeanu's supporters packed the courtroom and several burst into tears when the verdict was announced, AP news agency reported.
While there is actually no such saying in Chinese, the sentiment certainly rings true for many Icelanders these days.
It then took less than a week for our entire economy to collapse around a banking system that turned out to be based on a massive lie, and to this day most Icelanders are still coming to terms with what that means.
The government collapsed after unprecedented protests and was replaced by a left-wing alliance that promised changes that many people are still waiting for.
Mahir al-Zubaydi, also known as Abu Assad or Abu Rami, was said to head the group behind bombings which killed at least 16 people in Baghdad this week.
US officials described him as the al-Qaeda military commander for the whole of Baghdad east of the Tigris river.
They say he played a key role in planning some of the worst atrocities in Iraq over the past few years.
Zubaydi also took part in the videotaped killing of four Russian diplomats in June 2006, officials say.
US troops targeted Zubaydi on Friday after receiving intelligence following bombings in Baghdad against Shia Muslim mosques.
Troops tracked him down to a house in the Adhamiya district of Baghdad, a strongly Sunni Muslim area, surrounded the building and used loud speakers to order the suspect to surrender, reports the BBC's Hugh Sykes, in Baghdad.
The Americans say he responded by shooting at them, so they shot him, our correspondent says.
A woman reported to be his wife was also killed.
Military officials hailed Zubaydi's killing as a major step in the continuing battle with al-Qaeda militants in Baghdad.
"His removal from the AQI [al-Qaeda Iraq] network will send shockwaves through Baghdad's terrorist bombing networks," a US spokesman told the Associated Press.
But two smaller fish are hoping to take a bite of the gaming pie with their own mobile consoles.
The US-based Tapwave is bringing its Zodiac games PDA to the UK, while another US firm, Tiger Telematics, is using the UK as the launch pad for its Gizmondo console.
The mobile games market is shaping up to be the next battleground with more than 100 million people expected to be playing on the go by 2006.
Sony plans to debut its handheld PlayStation Portable (PSP) in Japan later this year, while Nintendo will compete with the new dual-screen DS.
As well as offering all the usual organiser functions like diary and contacts, it can also play music and video, as well as a selection of games such as Doom II, Duke Nukem and SpyHunter on a large 480x320 colour display.
"We wanted to design something from the ground up with entertainment and multimedia capabilities," Mr Connell told BBC News Online.
He said the device was aimed at a generation which had outgrown Nintendo's GameBoy, but wanted a PDA which could also play games.
"Nobody is addressing the older gamer in their twenties," he said.
Vying for the wallets of gamers will be the Gizmondo, which gets its global debut in the UK on 29 October and is expected to sell for around �230.
But its unique selling point, according to its makers, is that it comes with built-in global positioning system (GPS) technology.
Tiger Telematics, the company behind the Gizmondo, has a history of producing devices with satellite navigation.
"Our idea was to put GPS in a product that children would like to use," said Patrick Wallgren, head of Gizmondo global public relations.
One of the first games for the device, called Colors, is based on the idea of creating your gang territory and competing with others who come into your area.
"GPS is definitely the killer application," said Mr Wallgren, although he admitted that the company faced tough competition from the likes of Sony and Nintendo.
"We are focusing on getting first of all the early adopters, gamers aged between 15 and 29 years old," he said.
The Zodiac and Gizmondo are not just facing competition from Sony and Nintendo in the future.
Handset maker Nokia already made some in-roads with its N-Gage mobile/gaming hybrid.
It has shipped more than a million units and recently revamped the device to address criticisms of its original design.
That is double the number who used the net during the 2000 campaign according to research group, the Pew Internet and American Life Project.
Americans are increasingly going online for political news and commentary, its report found.
It suggests that the web is playing a positive role in democratic debate on a wide range of issues.
The study follows concerns expressed by some commentators that people would use the internet to reinforce existing political views rather than challenge them.
The survey asked both online and offline citizens how they had heard about debates as wide-ranging as gay marriage, free trade, the Iraq war and the arguments for and against presidential candidates George Bush and John Kerry.
Consistently internet users, especially those with broadband connections, had encountered the most arguments on both sides of the debates.
The statistics produced took into account the fact that internet users have higher levels of education and political interest than those that do not have access.
"Internet users do not burrow themselves into informational warrens where they hear nothing but arguments that reinforce their views," said John Horrigan, research specialist at the Pew Project, a non-profit group dedicated to looking at the social impact of the web in the US.
More than 40% of online American had got news and information about the presidential campaign from the web, the survey found.
Television remains the primary source of information but 31% of broadband users cited the internet as their main source of information about the US election.
The internet is exposing more Americans to different points of view, said Kelly Garret, co-author of the report.
"People are using the internet to broaden their political horizons, not narrow them," she said.
Some 67 million people in the US had received information or news about the Iraq war via e-mail or online.
The arguments surfers were typically hearing included the pro-war line that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who tortured and murdered his own people.
The most common anti-war argument was that the Bush administration had misled Americans about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction.
Academics privately admit the move is partly in response to the Laura Spence saga which blew up in 2000 when the Tyneside comprehensive pupil was rejected from Oxford.
The aim is to "dispel the myths" that surround applying to, and studying at, Cambridge and Oxford.
The universities hope the popular venues will encourage students from "non-traditional" backgrounds to apply.
Seminars at St James' Park on Friday will be led by Oxbridge tutors and undergraduates.
Liz Walker from Lifetime Careers Ltd, the company behind the Oxbridge conferences, said demand for places at the roadshows was very high, proving that the attempt to widen access was working.
"It is the first time that we have used Newcastle United as a venue for this unique conference," said Ms Walker.
"Many schools and colleges who have never sent students toOxbridge before, have booked places at this conference.
Her counterpart at Oxford, Jane Minto, said admissions figures showed that if more students from state schools applied to the university, more would be successful in gaining a place.
"The conferences offer us the opportunity to meet with local students and give them a chance to find out what Oxford has to offer them.
Laura Spence's former head teacher at Monkseaton Community School, Paul Kelley, welcomed their decision to come to the North East.
"It's an excellent idea for top universities to be actively recruiting from all regions in the UK," said Dr Kelley.
He did not think the Spence affair had put youngsters off applying to Oxbridge.
Officers have been using the mobile computers to enable them to record crimes without going back to the office and cut down on paperwork.
The force was the first in England to introduce mobile data terminals.
The devices mean frontline officers are out of the station more and have a greater visibility on the streets.
Leicestershire Police said the mobile computers help to keep its officers on the beat for 30% more time than they would otherwise have been able.
Officers can access all police data through the devices and has helped them tackle anti-social behaviour and identify offenders.

Hart saved acrobatically from Jermain Defoe, Tom Huddlestone and Benoit Assou-Ekotto as Spurs started strongly.
The excellent Gareth Bale struck the foot of the post with a rasping drive as a misfiring City were overwhelmed.
City did improve after the break and Shaun Wright-Phillips was denied by a last-ditch tackle, but Hart twice kept out efforts from Roman Pavlyuchenko.
And for all City's spending in the close-season, more than £100m on five new signings, it was Hart - brought back to the club after a season-long loan with Birmingham - who was their most valuable asset.
Hart delighted with 'huge' start
His magnificent interventions in the first half prevented the home side racking up a score that would have left City's embarrassment of riches simply embarrassed in the opening game of the new Premier League season.
While Tottenham immediately resumed their excellent form from last season, helped by lining up with ex-City man Vedran Corluka as their only change from the side that beat City 1-0 to book their spot in the Champions League play-offs, the visitors looked every inch the team of strangers that they are.
Debutants Yaya Toure, David Silva and Aleksandar Kolarov made little impression, with the latter taken off at half-time, and City boss Roberto Mancini looks set to face a difficult challenge in how to give his side the right balance.
The visitors also had no time to settle in the opening half, as Tottenham played with a fast tempo and produced fluent, attacking football that deserved reward.
Only a brilliant save from Hart, diving to his left, kept out Defoe's volley - the 23-year-old England keeper quickly justifying his selection ahead of Shay Given.
Hart made another fine stop to keep out Huddlestone's 25-yard effort and, later, produced an ever better one to claw away an Assou-Ekotto shot that was headed for the top corner.
With Bale in particular proving a menace, giving right-back Micah Richards a torrid time, Spurs attacked at will.
Tottenham striker Defoe was again denied soon after when the advancing Hart prevented him slotting home from Huddlestone's excellent pass over the top.
City carried little attacking threat as their midfield - packed with holding players - failed to retain the ball and lacked creativity.
In their only half-chances of the opening period, skipper Carlos Tevez hesitated in the box and was dispossessed and shots by Yaya Toure and Kolarov were wayward, and with Emmanuel Adebayor on the bench, City looked light up front.
But the visitors gave a better account of themselves after the break following what was likely to have been been a stern talk from manager Mancini - the Italian had almost lost his voice at the end of the game.
Possession and territory was more evenly split between the sides, and it was City who threatened first.
Yaya Toure looped a ball over the top for Wright-Phillips, who could not quite bring it under control and was robbed by an excellent tackle from Assou-Ekotto.
Another scooped pass from Yaya Toure played in Silva but his shot was blocked by Ledley King and Tevez wasted a half chance on the follow-up.
Yaya Toure's influence on the game was much greater now and Spurs could not dominate as they had done.
However, Spurs boss Harry Redknapp's side still looked dangerous and created chances to win the game.
A fast break from the home side gave substitute Pavlyuchenko two chances to test Hart and the goalkeeper was again equal to the challenge.
It proved to be the last chance of a game that Tottenham will feel they should have won after a sublime first-half display.
City will be heartened that they hung on when on the ropes and they come away with a rare point, having stopped a run of six straight league defeats at White Hart Lane.

Adam Pearson is to move to a new role as head of football operations with owner Russell Bartlett taking over Pearson's role as chairman.
The club, who have debts of £35m, are also to appoint an insolvency expert.
"He will work to get the players out and get contracts structured so they don't strangle the club," Pearson told BBC Radio Humberside.
Hull, who will hope to offload some of their highest-earning players this summer after their relegation from the Premier League, have also asked their squad to consider a pay cut.
"The club wanted to give them those contracts and they have got every right to honour them.
Hull's debts have spiralled since their promotion to the top flight two years ago and their problems became evident with the publication of accounts last October.
Pearson was brought back to the club for a second spell as chairman soon after to tackle the matter.
There were reports the club could go into administration if relegated, and therefore face the possibility of a 10-point penalty next season, but Pearson is anxious to avoid that.
"There is always that threat there but our aim is to avoid that 10-point penalty and that formal process of administration if at all possible.
Pearson has also said that tackling the debts will take short-term precedence over the appointment of a new manager.
Hull relieved Phil Brown of his duties in March in a last-ditch attempt to avoid relegation and brought in Iain Dowie on a short-term arrangement as football management consultant.
Dowie is keen to stay but it has been suggested recalling Brown would be a cheaper option.

Jon Dahl Tomasson is the new hero of Denmark after scoring both goals in their 2-1 win over Uruguay.
The 26-year-old, who joined AC Milan shortly before the World Cup, has been dubbed 'Jonaldo'.
And after his brace in the opening game of the campaign 'Jonaldo' is clearly flying high.
"I'll enjoy it while it lasts," Tomasson said of his new found fame.
His form going into the World Cup, which helped Feyenoord win the Uefa Cup, prompted his move to Italy.
Former Milan and Denmark star Brian Laudrup believes the comparison is fair and that Tomasson has all the credentials to succeed at both the World Cup and in Serie A.
"It's funny with Jon as you don't see him all that much," Laudrup said.
"But he's always able to be in the right place a few times.
Tomasson's goals have helped fire World Cup fever in Denmark.
However, Danish daily Jyllands-Posten has instead given credit to the coaching team of Morten Olsen and Michael Laudrup.
Jyllands-Posten lavished praise on the "cool brains" on the touchline who helped fire Denmark's World Cup dreams in the "heatwave in Ulsan.
Why did the deal fall apart?
The states have often been the forgotten partner in the anti-trust suit against Microsoft.
They have also maintained remarkable cohesion over the three-year process.
But they have made their presence known most during the two rounds of settlements talks over the last two years, and settlement talks have been one of the few places that has divided the states' camp.
The states have consistently pushed for the harshest remedies against the software giant, and some court watchers believe that it was the insistence by the states in last year's settlement talks that led to their collapse.
But the states coalition was strained during those talks, and cracks were seen in their united front.
In this round of talks, it is not surprising that the states that came out against the settlement are ones with technology companies that are averse to Microsoft, says Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil.
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that his opposition to the settlement after he spent the weekend listening to technical experts from Microsoft competitors, including IBM, AOL Time Warner, Sun Microsystems and Novell.
So what happens to the settlement - is that off?
The judge has established a two-track process for proceedings.
US Justice Department anti-trust chief Charles James said that the settlement would serve as a baseline for any additional remedies.
The judge could build on the settlement with the hopes that it might lure more states to settle and bring the case to a resolution.
And what are the next steps in the court case - can just a few states fight on?
The settlement always faced the judge's review, and that process will begin as soon as Microsoft, the federal government and some of the states sign the settlement.
That will begin a 60-day period of public comment followed by hearings.
Before the states' coalition splintered, legal experts had said that the judge was unlikely to reject the agreement, but with the states' coalition split, experts say that the case is in uncharted legal territory with no clear precedents.
In addition to the settlement review, Judge Kollar-Kotelly has also set in motion the process for remedy hearings.
She rejected a Microsoft motion that said the dissenting states lacked legal standing to proceed without the federal government.
If this drags on, will it hurt the stock markets?
It would - or to be more precise, a rapid solution would benefit the markets.
What stock markets hate more than anything is uncertainty, and the Microsoft case has provided that in huge quantities for the past three-and-a-half years.
The software industry is crucial to the US economy, and accounts for a hefty chunk of its stock market capitalisation.
No matter how unfavourable the eventual settlement seems to Microsoft, its shares - and those of most of its competitors - should bounce sharply once a deal is formalised.
And the preliminary draft agreement certainly seems far more favourable to the software giant than earlier proposals - in particular the initial demand that it should be broken up.
Battered by the internet slump, the economic slowdown and the effects of 11 September, tech industry investors are desperate for good news.
So if things are that urgent, when can we expect the trial to end?
Some of the dissenting states have said that they are still open to a settlement, and the judge has stated her preference for a quick settlement of the case.
The judge may suggest remedies during the hearings that could lure more states to sign off on a settlement, and legal experts say that the judge could suspend the remedy hearings phase if she believes the two sides are close to settling.
Barring a settlement, the case is far from over.
Researchers at the University of Plymouth are looking for volunteers to help them find out whether you can think yourself happy.
Volunteers are being asked to take part in an online survey.
It will involve three techniques; thinking about things you are grateful for, thinking about achievements and questioning negative thoughts.
Each technique involves about 10 minutes a day of pleasant mental activity which researchers have all been found to be effective in the past.

Human-made rubbish is being dumped near rivers or coastlines, and is slowly broken down as it is carried into seas.
But the bits are being swallowed by small creatures, like barnacles and lugworms, and are building up in them.
It's the first time scientists have looked at plastics gathering in oceans, but they don't yet know what the long-term damage could be on ocean life.
Marine scientists found that the bits of plastic were in sand samples they took from 17 beaches and riverbanks near the coast in the UK.
The team found that the plankton contained a lot more of the plastics, compared with samples taken over 40 years ago.
One worry is that the plastics could eventually get into the food that we eat, through plankton and fish.
More research now has to be done to work out what, if any, impact the pollution might have on the environment.
It's down to a chemical called citrulline which is found in the juicy fruit.
Citrulline is an organic compound which affects the body's blood vessels in the same way as the sex enhancement pills.
It helps relax the blood vessels which means blood gets around the body more easily.
The research comes from the US' Texas Fruit and Vegetable Improvement Centre.

The former Midland outfit will drive under the Spyker colours for the first time in Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.
Their signing of former Renault and Toyota designer Mike Gascoyne was a key factor in Albers' decision to stay.
But there are doubts over the future of sporting relations manager Johnny Herbert after mixed messages from Spyker's senior management team.
Spyker will also announce a new engine package shortly, and Mol said he was happy with the team's progress and Albers' decision to drive for them.
"Naturally as a Dutch team we are delighted and proud to have a Dutch driver," Mol said.
Albers also expressed his pleasure at the way the team was shaping up.
"I am delighted with the new ownership and their commitment to the technical development of the team with the arrival of Mike Gascoyne.
Her work for the Russian human rights group Memorial latterly focused on alleged human rights violations by government-backed militias.
Such was her importance as a regional expert that her office in the Chechen capital Grozny became the first stop for many visiting journalists, BBC Moscow correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes recalls.
Of mixed Russian-Chechen parentage, Ms Estemirova told the BBC in a 2007 interview that she felt she could understand both peoples.
Asked if she ever felt her life was in danger, she said her dedication to her work overrode her fears.
Born in the south Russian province of Saratov, she graduated in history from Grozny University and was teaching history in a school in the city until 1998, according to Memorial.
She began reporting on human rights abuses and when the second Chechen War started in 1999, she documented civilian casualties.
Joining Memorial in 2000, when she moved temporarily to neighbouring Ingushetia, she continued investigating civilian casualties in Chechnya, notably in the villages of Novye Atagy in March 2000 and Rigakha in April 2004.
In January 2005, a group of MEPs in the European Parliament awarded the Robert Schuman Medal to both her and Sergei Kovalyov, chairman of Memorial.
In October 2007, Ms Estemirova was awarded the inaugural Anna Politkovskaya award from the Reach All Women in War campaign group.
That award had been established after the killing of Politkovskaya - a journalist who sought to uncover human rights abuses in Chechnya - outside her home in Moscow in 2006.
Ms Estemirova was a close friend and colleague of the journalist, interpreting for her on her reporting trips to Chechnya.
Visiting London to collect the Politkovskaya prize, Ms Estemirova was interviewed about her life and work by BBC World Service's Outlook programme.
"I try to be very exact about how I go about things and of course I do have worries about my family and people close to me but I still have to do my work.
The government has approved 10 sites in England and Wales for new nuclear power stations, most of them in locations where there are already plants.
Ministers hope to fast-track the construction of the new plants so that some can be producing energy by as early as 2018 but critics say this is "over-ambitious".
Susan Watts looks at the details of the plan.
An Afghan doctor, Abdul Barri, said on Sunday that the boy had died from his injuries after the first night of bombing raids on the Taleban's southern stronghold of Kandahar.
But an official from the Taleban, who have regularly stressed the well-being of their leaders since the strikes started, said the doctor's report was "completely false".
There has been no independent confirmation of the boy's condition.
Doctor Barri spoke to the BBC as he crossed the border at the Chaman checkpoint near the Pakistani city of Quetta.
Mullah Omar's uncle was said to be hit in the same raid, and was receiving treatment in the hospital at Kandahar.
Dr Barri said the hospital had just five days of supplies left, and that people were leaving the city to try to get treatment at the border.
US military officials say they have targeted places where the Taleban leader lives because they hold command and control facilities.
Mullah Omar has been quoted by a Saudi magazine as saying that his own death would not bring an end to the war with America because others would take his place.
He has called on all Muslims to back the Taleban's fight against the United States.
Dorling Kindersley believe it is largely down to Ridley Scott's Robin Hood film which is released to the world in May.
The publisher also cites the arrival of arts centre Nottingham Contemporary as a further reason to visit the city.
Alongside Nottingham as the ten places to see are Istanbul in Turkey, Oslo in Norway and Boston in the USA.
The film was shot in the UK, mostly in Pembrokeshire National Park in Wales, Bourne Wood in Surrey and Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire.
A local tourism leader expects huge benefits for Robin Hood county.
Robin Hood is released in the UK in May 2010.
The city's new arts centre Nottingham Contemporary, designed by architects Caruso St John, have had 43,737 visitors since opening on Saturday, 14 November (correct to Friday, 18 December, 2009).
The other cities chosen by publishers Dorling Kindersley are Delhi in India, Nara in Japan, Tel Aviv in Israel, Valparaiso in Chile, Vancouver in Canada and the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.

US President Bill Clinton said Nato would continue the campaign until its objectives had been achieved.
But in London, there have been calls for a diplomatic solution to the crisis while in Moscow the Russian parliament has backed Yugoslavia joining a Russia-Belarus Union.
Meanwhile there remains uncertainty over the exact circumstances surrounding the Nato strike on the convoy of Kosovo Albanian refugees.
Nato cast doubt on whether footage broadcast by Serb TV showed their attack or another incident, or incidents, elsewhere.
The alliance said its aircraft had later attacked a second convoy, but had hit only military targets.
Some refugees in a third convoy reported that Serb aircraft had attacked them.
The UN refugee agency has said there is a danger of the entire Albanian population of Kosovo being driven out if expulsions by Serb forcescontinue at their present rate.
He added that expulsions - which had slowed in the past two weeks - had now resumed with "full force".
Meanwhile, the BBC is launching Radio Link - a service aimed at reuniting Kosovan refugees separated from their families during the Balkan conflict.
In addition, Serb media said another bridge across the Danube - the fifth so far - had been struck.
In Montenegro, Nato warplanes bombed the capital, Podgorica, in their first daylight raid on the city - Nato had earlier said it would avoid hitting targets in Montenegro if at all possible
Montenegrin media reported missile strikes on an airfield outside Podgorica and a subterranean military base.
The Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister, Dragisa Burzan, accused the Yugoslav army of provoking the Nato bombardment.
Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova has met Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic in the Serbian Presidency building in Belgrade.
A correspondent for Sky News television who was present said Mr Rugova appeared "exhausted but well".
Nato has cast doubt on two previous reported meetings between Mr Rugova and the Yugoslav leadership, both earlier this month.
He said the diplomatic initiative had to be backed by the threat and use of ground forces and must include Russia.
Washington has reaffirmed its intention to continue the campaign until its objectives had been achieved.
President Bill Clinton said Nato would intensify its attacks on Yugoslavia.
And the White House indicated the bombing campaign could continue for months, possibly into the middle of the summer.
The Vatican emphasised that the pilgrimage would be "exclusively religious and spiritual", "stopping in places linked to the story of salvation".
Now, millions of Catholic pilgrims visiting Rome in 2000 are being encouraged by the Vatican to continue their pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and the Pope clearly hopes to join them.
Concern about the strain that such extensive tours were putting on the Pope's frail constitution were heightened by his recent marathon visit to Poland, where he suffered a fall and also succumbed to a fever.
He has suffered from Parkinson's Disease for some time, with slurred speech and a trembling left hand as the outward symptoms.
But this latest announcement confirms the Pope's continuing determination to go out into the world, and particularly to celebrate what he calls the "Great Jubillee" of Christ's birth.
The scientists say some small storms are combining to obscure a large part of the planet's northern hemisphere.
If they build into a global storm, which can happen, it could interfere with the solar panels the probes use to generate power for their instruments.
On 25 December, Europe's Beagle 2 will land, followed by two US rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, on 3 and 24 January.
Observers noted the current storms starting to churn on Mars in the first week of December.
Since then, they have grown in size, and have been joined by smaller storms on their fringes.
"We don't know what is going to happen to this one," he said.
Sunlight heats airborne dust grains, warming the atmosphere, which then expands.
When this happens it can cause problems for orbiting spacecraft, or for spacecraft entering the atmosphere en route to a touchdown.
US space agency scientists say they are monitoring the situation closely.
The US military hopes that Mr Mutawakil will provide important intelligence about the Taleban and Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
Mr Mutawakil surrendered to the Afghan autorities in Kandahar, who handed him over to American military custody.
"As we've done with people that have turned themselves in, we will question him," Major Brad Lowell, a spokesman for the US Central Command, told Reuters.
"If we take any detaineeswe would hope to get some information," he said.
The BBC's Kate Clark in Kabul says it is not known what kind of a deal was reached for Mr Mutawakil's surrender but he may have valuable information, perhaps even on the whereabouts of Mullah Omar.
However, as a relative moderate, more hardline Taleban officials may not have shared key information with him, she says.
He also privately voiced concern about the increasing influence of Bin Laden and other Arab militants.
Despite the US campaign, very few senior Taleban figures have been caught and most members are still at large.
Although the Taleban's power base has been smashed, there are signs that some are regrouping.
One political party of relative moderates has been established in neighbouring Pakistan, and there are reports of a more shadowy hardline faction re-forming inside Afghanistan.
New legislation to allow the formation of political parties is due to be passed soon.
Interim Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah has said former Taleban would never be allowed to establish parties, but the interim justice minister, Abdulrahim Karimi, has told the BBC it would be up to the Supreme Court to decide.
Dr Rowan Williams, who is a published poet himself, will talk about his love of Wales' most famous bard whose best work arguably draws on the meaning of life and death.
Thomas was born and brought up in Swansea while Dr Williams, who leads the world's 70m Anglicans and was formerly the Archbishop of Wales, was raised in a Welsh-speaking family in the Swansea Valley.
The archbishop heads a list of celebrities, poets and performers taking part in weeks of events to celebrate the life of the hard-living poet who died aged just 39 in November 1953 in New York after yet another mammoth drinking bout.
He is to give a talk at Swansea's Dylan Thomas Centre, the focal point of the city's cultural festivities in memory of Thomas.
The evening, on 31 October, is the same night as comedian and writer Alexei Sayle gives his take on Thomas' short story writing skills.
Dr Williams' attendance is a coup for the festival which can already boast the Liverpool poets Roger McGough and Brian Patten in its line-up as well as the veteran Welsh poet, Dannie Abse.
Thomas fans argue his legacy was largely ignored in Wales for years after his death by a literary establishment which was embarrassed by the man's chaotic lifestyle of alcohol and infidelity.
The contribution of the Archbishop of Canterbury is seen as his artistic support for the work to ensure that Thomas gets the recognition he deserves in his own country, say organisers.
David Woolley, literature officer at the Dylan Thomas Centre, secured the Dr Williams' visit.
"Therefore, it's a quite appropriate really that someone who is the Archbishop of Canterbury but also write poetry should be at the festival about Dylan Thomas
Solidarity has been banned since December 1981 when martial law was declared following social tensions in Poland.
It is the second time Pope John Paul II - who was formerly Archbishop of Krakow - has returned to his native Poland since he became head of the Roman Catholic Church in 1978.
Mr Walesa met the Pope in the Tatra Mountains in the south of the country towards the end of his eight-day visit to Poland.
Solidarity sources say the Pope told Mr Walesa that he should rely on the advice of the Catholic Church, rather than organising street demonstrations as part of the trade union movement's campaign to bring about political reforms in Poland.
As Archbishop, Karol Wojtyla took an uncompromising stand against the Communist regime.
But the Pope has urged the country to try to resolve its differences through dialogue and not confrontation.
Officials close to Mr Walesa say the Pope also told the Solidarity leader that martial law could be lifted by the autumn.
This, they say, was indicated to the Pope by Prime Minister General Wojciech Jaruzelski during talks just hours before he met Mr Walesa.
Mr Walesa has said he was "moved and enthusiastic" about his meeting with the Pope, and is willing to take a "back seat" as a focus for opposition to the government in ending martial law.
The Pope has also addressed a congregation of two million worshippers in Katowice, Poland's industrial heartland in the south, and told them that workers should be able to join free trade unions.
During his visit the Pope blessed the widows of workers killed when martial law was imposed.
The Polish Government has said it will cooperate closely with the Catholic Church in the future, and it is well known the Pope would like the church to be involved in any reconciliation process.
President Henryk Jablonski, who said goodbye to the Pope at Krakow airport, told reporters that "dialogue is possible and inevitable".
Before returning to the Vatican in Rome, the Pope made a televised address to the Polish people from the airport.
The Pope served as an inspiration for many Catholics in Poland who wanted religious, political and economic freedoms.
Martial law was lifted a month after the Pope's visit - which also led to a government amnesty for political prisoners.
During the next five years gradual steps were taken to create a civil society in Poland.
In 1988 a grave economic crisis, coupled with the era of "glasnost" and "perestroika" under reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, forced the Polish government to negotiate with Solidarity.
Elections were held in 1989 when Solidarity won a landslide victory and formed a coalition government.
The following year Lech Walesa was elected as Poland's president, transforming the country into a market economy.
The Pope died at 2137 (1937 GMT) on Saturday 2 April 2005 after he failed to recover from a throat operation.
The 26-year-old crossed the finish line off the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe at 0216 GMT on Saturday after leaving the French port of St Malo 13 days ago.
MacArthur set a new record of 13 days, 13 hours, 31 minutes, 47 seconds for the passage.
The previous best time for monohulls was 15 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes, set by Frenchman Yves Parlier on Cacolac d'Aquitaine in 1994.
She and Golding were left to duel at the head of the fleet for more than seven days after Roland Jourdain was forced to put in at Madeira with a torn mainsail.
MacArthur arrived in Pointe-a-Pitre at 2216 local time on Friday night and was greeted by an armada of small boats flashing lights.
"I cannot say that that was easier than a Vendee [Globe race], it has taken every ounce of mental and physical energy that I possess.
"Mike Golding sailed a fantastic race, pushed us both to our limits and beyond - I am disappointed for him, but of course elated to have to held on to the lead.
Golding finished second at 1134 GMT on Saturday, nine hours and 17 minutes behind MacArthur.
MacArthur sprang to fame by finishing second in the 2000/2001 Vendee Globe race on Kingfisher, becoming the youngest and fastest woman to lap the planet.
In 1997, at the age of 21 she completed the Mini-Transat and a year later she won the 50ft monohull class in the Route du Rhum.
MacArthur also won the Europe 1 New Man Star in 2000 and was second in the double-handed Transat Jacques Vabre last year with Alain Gautier on the multihull Foncia.
She received an MBE (Member of the British Empire) medal in last year's New Year Honours List in Britain.
Meanwhile, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux, who beat MacArthur in the Vendee Globe, won the Route du Rhum's 60ft multihull category.
The 37-year-old crossed the line at 2038 GMT on Saturday, completing the course in 13 days, seven hours, and 53 minutes.
Several capsized, although no one wasseriously injured.
The 22-year-old, who has recently recovered from stomach flu, lost 7-5 4-6 3-6 to American Lilia Osterloh at the Stanford Classic.

Osterloh, a former NCAA champion for Stanford University, had the backing of most of the centre court crowd.
Most hope one day to become imams in the many mosques of the Muslim-dominated Chinese region of Xinjiang.
"I believe in Islam, I came here to deepen my faith, to learn more," said 24-year-old, Bolo Alashankur.
"I learnt about Islam at home, from my family, but now I've come to the college for formal training," he said.
At a press conference, Communist Party boss Wang Lequan warned that the province was under attack.
"Fear is definitely pervasive in Xinjiang," said Nicolas Becquelin of pressure group Human Rights in China.
"People from the Uighur community are very much at risk of being arrested, detained, tortured or sentenced to labour camps for anything the government equates to separatist feelings, or for holding religious activities," he said.
Life is difficult for Muslims in Xinjiang, he said, warning that he could get into trouble for speaking to the BBC.
This ethic dilution is denied by officials such as Yahfu Wumar, director of Urumqi's Religious and Ethnics Affairs Committee.
"There's very little difference in the ethnic balance between now and the early 1950s," he said.
Beijing says its priority is to stop religious extremism and terrorism in this far-off province.
But critics say it is criminalizing an entire race of people, and that this repression will only radicalize those who want the freedom to pray and the chance to share in China's new-found riches.
Chicago is Boeing's choice for its new world headquarters, edging out Denver and Dallas after a high-profile US-wide search.
Boeing confirmed the move on Thursday after a surprise announcement in March that it was leaving Seattle for a more central location.
The company plans to move to its new headquarters on 4 September from Seattle, where it was founded in 1916.
"We looked at three very exciting metropolitan areas in which to base our company," Boeing chairman Phil Condit said.
It is also home to the world's busiest airports, O'Hare International Airport.
The new headquarters is expected to be smaller than Seattle's operations, with reportedly 500 fewer employees - half of its current staff.
The company will keep its massive aircraft factories and design and development facilities in the Seattle area.
Chicago was eager to land Boeing, both to add another world-class business to those already based there - like McDonalds, United Airlines, Motorola and Sears Roebuck - and to reverse a recent trend that has seen it lose several corporate headquarters, including Amoco before it merged with BP.
Meanwhile, Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines announced that it was buying 15 new Boeing 767 aeroplanes in part to replace nine older Boeing aircraft it gained in its acquisition of Trans World Airlines.

Another anomaly, according to Nasa, was that the day's activities were not saved to the rover's long-term memory.
As of Wednesday, the rover seems to have recovered and is responsive to commands from Earth.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team operating Spirit will begin diagnostic tests to determine the cause of Sunday's glitches.
The rover reported receiving its instructions on Sunday but pictures at the beginning and the end of the day showed that it had not moved.
Engineers tried to determine Spirit's precise location on Tuesday by locating the sun with the rover's camera.
The rover followed commands and located the sun, but not in the location in the sky that Spirit anticipated.
"We don't have a good explanation yet for the way Spirit has been acting for the past few days," said JPL team leader Sharon Laubach.
One theory holds that the rover's electronics could have been damaged by a cosmic ray - a fast-moving particle from the sun or elsewhere in the galaxy.
Whatever the cause, the problem appears to have corrected itself.

If the vote is adopted as trust policy, hunts will be able to follow sick or injured deer on to their land to kill the animal.
Trust members voted to allow hunting of stags at the Holnicote Estate, which forms much of Exmoor.
The results at the annual general meeting in Cheltenham were 12,768 in favour of the ban, 20,188 against.
Protesters from the League Against Cruel Sports gathered outside the meeting at the town's racecourse in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade delegates to vote against allowing injured animals to be hunted.
The trust banned stag hunts about 10 years ago and hunting with dogs became illegal in 2005.
The fox hunting season began on Saturday, with thousands of enthusiasts setting out on foot and horseback following packs of hounds.
Plans to halve the sentences of offenders in England and Wales who plead guilty early could be scrapped.
Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, outlines what a rethink of sentencing could mean.
However, the price is still below the 475p that many analysts say will be needed.
It is thought that the British company's boardsees 500p as a fair price.
Other analysts pointed out that a few months ago, shareholders would have accepted 450p, but after the return to favour of "old economy" stocks at the expense of hi-tech companies, and after a spirited defence by the British group's chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite, investors wanted more.
Lafarge attacked Blue Circle's defence strategy.
Earlier this month, Mr Haythornthwaite announced an �800m cash return to shareholders if they stuck with the current management.
Analysts have now calculated a total sum-of-the-parts value for the firm of 450p-a-share, suggesting Lafarge would have to offer significantly more as a premium for a takeover sweetener.
Lafarge is active in 65 countries and employs 71,000 people worldwide, with a turnover of $10bn.
The firm, with a history going back more than 160 years, wants to create a global giant in each of its five product groups, cement, aggregates and concrete, roofing, gypsum and speciality products.
It has already moved into the UK market by purchasing building materials group Redland.
Blue Circle has also been hit by the consolidation in the building materials industry, with UK rival cement maker Rugby was acquired by one of its biggest clients, RMC.
It operates eight cement plants in the UK and owns companies in North America, Africa, and Asia.
The offer closes on 3 May.
He is one of just four survivors who have lived to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the event.
Mr Wilenberg, the only son in a family of five, was sent to Treblinka in October 1942 from Opatow, a small town in southern Poland.
Fleeing Nazi persecution, his family had been forced to separate early in the war.
His two sisters had already died in Treblinka, the second largest extermination camp after Auschwitz.
At the height of the killings, up to 17,000 people were gassed daily in the camp's 13 chambers.
They filed towards the waiting train carriages.
Once at Treblinka, Mr Wilenberg narrowly escaped death because an old friend, who was already at the camp, told him the Nazis were looking for bricklayers.
He volunteered, and instead of being herded to the gas chamber he was directed to a wooden barracks.
The revolt began at 0400 on 2 August, after a German guard became suspicious and the prisoners had to kill him.
In the fighting, 85 Nazi guards and around 800 prisoners were killed.
He made his way to Warsaw, where he hoped his father was still alive.
Samuel Wilenberg joined the Polish resistance, took part in the Warsaw uprising, and emigrated to Israel after the war.
Before the revolt forced its closure in November 1943, Treblinka concentration camp claimed the lives of 870,000 people, mainly Jews.
A spokeswoman said it was normal that Mr Solana would step down when his term ended in October, and that he would be "very busy doing other activities".
He had been considered a main contender for the new EU foreign policy role set to be created by the Lisbon Treaty.
Under the treaty, which has yet to be ratified by all 27 member states, the post would combine the jobs of the existing foreign affairs supremo and the external affairs commissioner to give the EU more clout on the world stage.
In an interview with Spain's ABC newspaper on Sunday, Mr Solana said he did not intend to stay on as the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, regardless of whether Lisbon was or was not ratified.
"These past 10 years have been very important for me, but also I think for Europe," he said.
The 66-year-old former Nato secretary general and Spanish foreign minister said he was "calm and happy" and would continue working with the same intensity until his mandate ended.
His spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach, confirmed his comments and told the BBC he would be very busy doing other activities in other fields.
Is the current EU bail-out the right strategy for Greece?
Had the Sadrists opted clearly for one of the two main contenders - the incumbent Nouri Maliki, or his main challenger, the secular Iyad Allawi - they and their allies could have tilted the balance decisively in favour of one or other of the top two blocs.
As it is, they chose Ibrahim al-Jaafari - former leader of Mr Maliki's Daawa Party and of the 2005 interim government - who came out of the Sadrist poll narrowly ahead of Jaafar Muhammad Baqer al-Sadr, scion of a distinguished Shia clerical family and a newly-elected MP for Mr Maliki's coalition.
The choice of either of the two men would neatly pull the rug from under Mr Maliki, who came out fourth in the referendum with a mere 10% of the votes - while his chief rival, Iyad Allawi, came just behind with 9%.
That may end up being the chief upshot of the exercise - to give the Sadrist leadership a free hand, with popular support, to veto both of the top two contestants for the premiership if it wants to.
It also frees them to withhold support from Adel Abd al-Mahdi, currently one of Iraq's two vice-presidents, who is the candidate of their alliance partners the Supreme Council, but about whom they are unenthusiastic.
He came equal-last in the poll with a scant 2% of the vote.
How hard the movement would push to have Mr Jaafari or Mr Sadr adopted as prime minister remains to be seen.
It was conducted without controls or checks of any kind, and anybody could easily have voted many times by moving from one improvised polling station to another.
The Sadrists detest Nouri Maliki, who destroyed their Mehdi Army militia in 2008 and detained many of its followers, although he owed his office to their support in 2006.
Sadrist officials say they want to see Mr Maliki's alliance included in a new government, but they would clearly prefer it to be without Mr Maliki himself.
They also insist without reservation that Mr Allawi's secular-Sunni coalition must be included, because it attracted the bulk of the Sunni vote.
But the Sadrists, who have a strict Shia religious outlook, might find it hard to serve under Mr Allawi, a secular Shia, as prime minister.
They will certainly continue to play a key role in the intensive bargaining over the formation of a coalition government, which has yet to begin in earnest more than a month after the 7 March elections.
They won 40 seats in the new parliament out of a total of 70 taken by the third-placed Iraqi National Alliance which includes other Shia factions such as the once-dominant Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council and Ibrahim al-Jaafari's group.
Neither of the top two coalitions, Mr Maliki's or Mr Allawi's, could muster enough seats to govern on its own without including the Alliance.
At the moment, the trend seems to be towards all the four main blocs which emerged strongly from the elections, including the Kurds, teaming up in an all-embracing national unity government.
The Sadrist spokesman, Sheikh Saleh al-Obaidi, told the BBC that that is what his movement wanted.
The country's most senior and influential Shia religious eminence, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, has also let it be known that he favours an all-inclusive government.
Under his guidance, the Shia clerical establishment (the Marjaiyya) urged the electorate to vote, but steered scrupulously clear of favouring one faction over another.
Even if the principle is accepted all round, getting the four blocs to fit together into a unified administration is going to be very difficult and time-consuming.
There is bound to be enormous competition over the top jobs and over the general balance within the government.
Agreeing a common platform that would be acceptable both to the secular forces of Mr Allawi, and the Shia and Sunni religious factions, is also likely to involve protracted wrangling.
Given the undoubted influence of outside powers - the Americans and their regional Sunni Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia on one side, and on the other Iran, strongly connected with Iraq's Shia - there are several developments that might favour the emergence of a balanced and inclusive government in Baghdad.
"We wanted to explain our point of view about how the Iraqi lists can co-operate to build the coming government," said Sadrist spokesman Sheikh Obaidi.
By the same token, the spokesperson for Mr Allawi's Iraqiyya List, Maisoun al-Damlouji, confirmed that it would shortly be sending a delegation to Tehran for talks with Iranian officials.
All of these are preliminary background manoeuvres in advance of serious coalition bargaining, which can only get under way in earnest once complaints and appeals have been settled and the election results have been ratified by the judiciary, which will take at least another week.
Once it kicks off, the general betting is that it will take many weeks, and probably several months, before a government is born.
In the meantime, with violence apparently gaining momentum, there are fears that insurgents may try to exploit the delay to step up their efforts to derail the entire political process, as the Americans prepare to withdraw all their combat troops by the end of August.
Building an enticing network of toll roads to run parallel to the UK's most congested motorways has been damned by an unlikely alliance of motoring groups and green activists.
Friends of the Earth called the proposal - intended to draw drivers willing and able to pay tolls away from clogged roads - "an environmental disaster".
Doubtless, some motorists already saddled with fuel duty and road tax (the pay-per-car Vehicle Excise Duty or VED) will not take kindly to a two-tier road network which levies an extra charge on those wanting to cut - or merely be able to confidently predict - the length of their journey time.
However, the toll paying aspect of Birt's idea - if not the road building - may be far less radical than his "blue-sky" title might suggest.
While the average British driver pays a total tax burden on a par with counterparts in Ireland, Denmark, Italy and France, the UK's roads are significantly more congested.
While almost a quarter of British trunk roads are fouled up for more than an hour a day, fewer than one in 20 French and no Danish roads experience similar gridlock, according to the Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT).
"At the moment we have a very blunt and unfair taxation system," says Professor David Begg, the head of the independent advisory.
The commission approached the question of road charging not by assuming it was thinking the unthinkable (Lord Birt's brief), but by noting that our roads are incongruously "the only public utility that are free at the point of use".
If the cost of road use were to be calculated like train tickets, telephone calls or electricity - drivers would no longer so unthinkingly crowd onto the same section of highway at the same time.
Just as most Britons wait for the cheap evening rates to kick in before chatting to friends on the phone, many drivers would be similarly canny in choosing the route and time of their journey - balancing urgency with cost.
The commission also said in February that road tolls would more realistically spread the varying cost of road use across the driving public.
Varying road tolls depending on location and traffic volume would reduce the tax burden for country drivers, whose roads cost society perhaps 25 times less if traffic jams and exhaust fumes are included.
Prof Nutt told the BBC the possibility of allowing Dutch-style cannabis cafes should be "explored".
But his call comes as another academic is due to publish a study highlighting the possible links between the drug and schizophrenia.
"The more you smoke, the higher the risk," Prof Robin Murray told the BBC.
"You could make a moral position that why should people be imprisoned for possessing something that effectively will only harm themselves?"
He suggested that "trial towns" might be set up for an experiment.
Prof Nutt was sacked three weeks ago from his post as head of The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) by Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who accused him of campaigning against the government's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug.
The professor had attacked what he called the "artificial" separation of alcohol and tobacco from illegal drugs and said smoking cannabis created only a "relatively small risk" of psychotic illness.
But this view is challenged by research due to be published next month by Robin Murray, professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, who said that eight studies published since 2002 had shown that the risk of developing schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms was higher in those who used cannabis.
He told The Report the risk increased in younger cannabis users and those who smoked skunk, the more potent strain of the drug.
"Our evidence was that if you started smoking by the age of 18, then you're about one-and-a-half times more likely to go psychotic by the time you are 26," said Prof Murray.
Prof Nutt said Prof Murray's was an important study but "we need to know if it is replicated across the country".
Prof Nutt said it was difficult to tell if the drug was more dangerous to adolescents.

Dembele set for Fulham move - Hughes
City boss Roberto Mancini confirmed on Friday Bellamy would not make their 25-man Premier League squad and that the 31-year-old should find a new club.
Hughes has signed Bellamy twice before, at Blackburn and City, and was also his manager when in charge of Wales.
"It seems that Manchester City won't be using Craig at Premier League level, so from his point of view it is very important that he makes the right decision for his career.
Fulham are the latest club to take an interest in Bellamy, with Celtic keen to take the forward on loan for a second time, while he has also been linked with Sunderland and Tottenham.
Bellamy, who had a four-month spell with Celtic in 2005 while on the books of Newcastle, is surplus to requirements at Eastlands after a summer of heavy spending.
After being cut from Mancini's squad for the Europa League earlier this week, Bellamy said a failure to make the 25-man list in the league might cause him to quit football.
Bellamy has scored 15 goals for Manchester City in 51 appearances since joining from West Ham in a £14m transfer in January 2009.
Fuham are also chasing AZ Alkmaar striker Moussa Dembele, with Hughes suggesting a deal is imminent.
The Belgian's arrival for around £5m would be a welcome after Andy Johnson's knee injury meant that Fulham had to rely on makeshift striker Zoltan Gera to partner Bobby Zamora up front last season.
Hughes was at the Premier League on Thursday trying to secure a work permit for Dembele, who had also attracted the interest of Birmingham.
The League Two club are refusing to release Campbell's registration so he can sign for another club until he agrees on a "statement of departure".
"I'm trying to agree a deal so the player can move on and the club can move on," Taylor told BBC Radio 5 live.
The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender joined big-spending County in August amid a blaze of publicity, but left the club less than a month into a five-year deal.
Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), said County were keen to stop Campbell discussing matters relating to the club's ownership.
"From Notts County's point of view, they had a lot of bad publicity concerning the identity of their owners, and they're quite sensitive to criticism.
"They've answered the questions of the Football League with regards to ownership, but they don't want a bun fight in public.
"They feel it didn't do their reputation any good that Sol chose to leave and they don't want it damaged any more.
Campbell has been training with old club Arsenal, but Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he would not be making a move for his former captain.
Championship side West Brom have also been linked with the centre-half.
Campbell cannot go anywhere until County relinquish his registration, but Taylor said he had no idea if the 35-year-old had a club lined up.
"It's for Sol to speak for himself, but everybody knows he was playing at the highest level," said Taylor.
His parents told him it was OK, that the soldiers were there to protect him.
"But wasn't the bad man a soldier?" he asked.
It's hard to correctly gauge the feeling on the base at the moment.
It is so huge it is almost impossible to get a proper idea of how people are coping.
It's not just the children who sense a loss of security.
The soldiers the military offered up for interview spoke of how the community had pulled together in the face of such horror.
Many soldiers said they treated it just like the war zones they had visited.
A place that was meant to be out of harm's way.
As news of the shooting spread, though, the tables turned.
The answer to that will affect much.
The Government can and should do more, but progress is being made and this should be acknowledged.
The new child tax credit, starting in April, will be an important and necessary vehicle for delivering on the child poverty pledge.
Take-up is crucial, but the Treasury is pulling out all the stops to ensure that families are aware of their entitlement.
Further increases in financial support for children will be needed if the Government is to achieve its target to reduce the number of children in poverty by a quarter by 2004/05.
The next milestone will be a halving of child poverty by 2010.
There is no magic wand for ending child poverty but ensuring an adequate income for children must be at the heart of the government's strategy.
Tackling child poverty is an investment for the long-term, and is crucial to delivering world-class education and health services.
The poverty of today is not always the same as the poverty seen by our parents or grandparents, but it is not a thing of the past.
Poverty remains one of the most serious problems facing children today, with a negative impact on health, education, social and psychological development and future life chances and opportunities.
But poverty today is often hidden, driven behind closed doors by stigma, embarrassment and isolation.
Children may miss school because they are worried about their appearance, or not claim their free school dinner because they are afraid of being labelled the 'poor kid' and teased because of their poverty.
Ministers should take every opportunity to explain why the goal of ending child poverty is so necessary.
It is not about the politics of envy, but a pragmatic response to the social and economic costs of a society where so many children are left behind.
But the pledge to eradicate child poverty deserves cross-party support.
Politicians can disagree on the means, but the goal of improving the well-being and life chances of children should straddle the political divide.
The next Budget and this summer's spending review will be the last opportunities for influencing delivery of the child poverty target for 2004/05.
Estimates suggest that the Chancellor will need to spend an additional �1bn on the child tax credit.
Despite the difficult and gloomy international situation, the challenges at home should not be forgotten.
Tackling child poverty is an investment, but it takes a brave politician who is ready to take tough decisions today, for long term returns.
She picked up best breakthrough female performance for Mean Girls, best kiss for The Notebook and a third award with the whole cast of Mean Girls.
Indie hit Napoleon Dynamite picked up best film, Leonardo DiCaprio was best male and Lindsay Lohan was best female.
The awards, voted for by viewers, also reunited the cast of 1980s teen hit The Breakfast Club.
The cast of the film, including Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy and Anthony Michael Hall, was serenaded onto the stage by rock band Yellowcard.
The cable network also gave its first lifetime achievement award to Tom Cruise, who accepted it from girlfriend Katie Holmes.
"If I've been able to entertain you at all, okay? Then, I thank you for allowing me to do so," Cruise said.
Child actress Dakota Fanning, who stars with Cruise in the forthcoming War of the Worlds, won best frightened performance for Hide and Seek, and Dustin Hoffman got comedic performance for Meet the Fockers.
Most striking of all was the self-confident self-referencing that few politicians would risk.
"I know that Tony said our project would only be complete when the Labour Party learned to love Peter Mandelson", he said.
The wolf whistles and standing ovation that greeted his speech marked a remarkable moment.
A key ingredient of the feud that festered within Labour for years, the Brownites viewed Mandelson as a traitor for backing Blair over Brown.
At a Tribune rally in 1996 Gordon Brown is said to have told the crowd that when Peter Mandelson once asked him for 10p to phone a friend, Brown gave him 20p, saying "here, ring them all".
So today's speech, as Lord Mandelson used his own career as an allegory for the whole party with Gordon Brown gazing on, was striking political theatre.
As Lord Mandelson patronised and ridiculed the Tories in equal measure Labour's delegates felt a surge of something they have not had for a while - hope.
Years ago, a former conference favourite held up a jar containing a crab and christened it Peter.
But times have changed and in a peculiar way Peter Mandelson has become the John Prescott of this conference, tickling it in just the right places.
Of course the irony is that New Labour may have finally fallen in love with Peter Mandelson at the moment that many are predicting the party's demise.
The theatre's owners said they were "absolutely delighted" with the news.
Robert Burns was a patron and Peter Pan author JM Barrie was inspired at the theatre to write plays.
Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin were among the visitors to the auditorium.
The historic building is no longer fit for modern needs and the ambitious proposals centre on a full time, professionally run theatre with a 300-seat main auditorium and 100-seat studio.
A trust formed four years ago has spent �125,000 coming up with a plan for the future.
Carol Godchild, a spokesperson for the trust and the Guild of Players, said the donation had saved the theatre.
"We are absolutely delighted that the council has seen the merit of coming into partnership with us," she said.
"We can now move to make a big case for the remaining funding and hopefully begin work at the beginning of spring.
"If we hadn't got the money today, I think it would have killed the project.
The players were looking forward to getting back on stage and performing in plays and pantomimes, she added.
The council earlier gave �20,000 towards a feasibility study into the renovation plans.
The company is paid for entirely by membership subscriptions and box office receipts.
The theatre does not at the moment receive any grant aid towards running costs.
It is the venue for the Guild of Players' own productions and for performances from visiting companies, including Scottish Opera.
The building is also used extensively as a venue for Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival, Dumfries Music Festival and the Dumfries Operatic Society.

Strauss confident for first Ashes Test
England will wait until Wednesday morning before naming their XI, but batsman Ian Bell will not feature after he was released from the squad so he can play for Warwickshire.
Strauss believes key all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who shone in the dramatic series win four years ago, is desperate to once again play in a winning Ashes team.
Flintoff also captained England when they suffered a 5-0 whitewash to Australia in 2006-07 and Strauss says that makes him even more determined.
"Freddie has settled in brilliantly and is very motivated to play well in this series," added Strauss.
Flintoff said the thought of playing in an Ashes series drove him on while he was recovering from a recent knee injury.
"The reason you do all the rehab is to put on that England shirt, to get the chance to play in an Ashes series.
"I'd have loved to have played in the Twenty20 World Cup because it is a great tournament, but the ultimate is the Ashes.
Strauss, meanwhile, admits a good start in Cardiff - which has never hosted an Ashes Test before - is crucial in the five-match series.
"You definitely want early momentum in a series like this because once you go behind it's hard to pull it back," added Strauss.
They have also suffered a major blow with fast bowler Brett Lee ruled out with a hip injury but Strauss is nevertheless expecting a stern test of his side's credentials.
"We have to be wary about how much we talk about Brett because although he's a fantastic bowler, whoever replaces him will complete a strong attack," said Strauss.
"They will have a good balance and we will be expecting a severe examination right from the start - the worst thing we could do is assume the bowling attack will be worse off without him.
"It's true that Australia have lost some players with aura so maybe it's not quite as intimidating as it used to be, but we're expecting some hard cricket.
"We know what it is like playing against the Aussies but we won't be bullied this series, we will go toe-to-toe and look them in the eye.
Fast bowler Stuart Broad, who will be playing in his first Ashes Test, reckons there is no-one more capable of exploiting the potentially seamer-friendly conditions than pace colleague James Anderson.
"I think swing is going to be a huge part, whether it is reverse or conventional swing," said Broad.
Broad's fellow paceman Graham Onions of Durham and Yorkshire all-rounder Tim Bresnan have been added to England's performance squad for the summer.
The pair impressed against West Indies earlier this summer, and Onions is in the squad to face Australia in the first Test.
Topp set up Kyle Nix for the opener in the seventh minute before Omar Daley made it 2-0 with a deflected shot.
Dave Hibbert reduced the deficit with a header before Peter Thorne restored the advantage by steering in Daley's ball.
The Shrews made it 3-2 through Marc Pugh before Barry Conlon scored from the spot after Darran Kempson fouled David Wetherall.
Local officials said Sergio Cicala and Philomene Kaboure were picked up by an army patrol in the eastern Gao region.
Italy's foreign minister said they were "in the hands of Malian authorities" and were being taken to a "safe place".
Mr Cicala and Mrs Kaboure - who is also a citizen of Burkina Faso - were seized in December in neighbouring Mauritania.
The married couple had been driving past the eastern town of Kobenni on 18 December - en route to Burkina Faso to see Mrs Kaboure's 12-year-old son - when they were stopped by gunmen.
AQIM had demanded in February that Mali's government free imprisoned militants before 1 March in exchange for the couple.
Shortly before the deadline expired, Mr Cicala urged Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to intervene in a purported audio message posted on the internet.
In Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the Italians' release had been the "fruit of intense diplomatic work that led authorities in Mali to take decisive actions to reach this solution".
"We had to work for many months on very complex political and diplomatic negotiations," he told state television.
Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb emerged in early 2007, after a feared militant group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), aligned itself with Osama Bin Laden's international network.
It has waged a campaign of suicide bomb attacks and ambushes in Algeria, and in recent years has become more active in the Sahara.
Here are some key quotes from his speech.
A small number of suspected terrorist leaders and operatives captured during the war have been held and questioned outside the United States, in a separate program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.
This program has been, and remains, one of the most vital tools in our war against the terrorists.
The Supreme Court's recent decision has impaired our ability to prosecute terrorists through military commissions, and has put in question the future of the CIA program.
Tourism flourishes on the tropical Caribbean island, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year and is a stopping-off point for cruise ships.
Most Martiniquais have mixed ancestry, being the descendants of 17th century French settlers and slaves brought from Africa to work on plantations.
Serious protests at rising prices and persistent unemployment flared early in 2009 on Martinique and other French Carribean islands, prompting the French government to negotiate more aid and the promise of constitutional reform.
The island has an active volcano, Mount Pelee, which erupted in 1902, razing the town of Saint-Pierre and killing its 30,000 residents.
Martinique is the birthplace of the African-French music form "the Beguine", whose influence can be heard in the zouk music of the French West Indies.
Visited by the explorer Christopher Columbus and briefly occupied by the Spanish, Martinique was settled by the French in 1635.
Other colonial powers vied for control of the increasingly-prosperous sugar-producing island, and it came under brief periods of English rule in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
TV and radio services are provided by the French public overseas broadcaster, RFO, and by private operators.
Once upon a time they were just nouns; now perfectly decent words like egg and smile have become financial brands, thanks to the marketing minds of the new e-banks.
Where once you had to go to a branch or pick up the phone to satisfy your banking needs, now you can get online and deal direct with your bank's computer.
There is a huge array of banking services available to the customer who wants to do it on the net.
Lloyds TSB, Barclays, NatWest and HSBC all have "integrated" services, as they like to call them, whereby if you are a branch customer you can use the internet in addition to or instead of over-the-counter services.
Then there are the "stand-alone" accounts which operate solely on the internet and have more interesting names, such as Egg (from Prudential), Smile (from the Co-Op), If (Halifax), Cahoot (Abbey National) and First-E.
But will online banking really replace branch banking?
And will that benefit the big High Street banks or their e-commerce competitors?
The attraction of online banking is twofold for the financial sector.
First, at the moment most of the people who bank online are exactly the kind of customers banks want to attract - young, well-to-do, and high-spending.
Behind many of the e-banks, however, are some major European banking groups eager to break down national barriers and access the lucrative UK domestic market.
First-e, for example, is partly owned by Banco Santander, Spain's largest bank.
Some of the big High Street banks plan to launch their own, separately branded internet banking services.
"The service is a response to the changing needs of our customers," he explained.
But she shares the concern of Don Cruickshank over charges imposed by banks for use of the Link cash machine network.
"Internet customers rely on Link, and we don't want to have to charge our customers extra and erode the savings they enjoy through banking online," she says.
Internet banks crucially depend on the use of cash machines from other banks to enable customers to make withdrawals.
The Cruickshank report pointed out that the High Street banks have a lock on money transmission services.
So how successful the e-banks can become will partly depend on the outcome of the Cruickshank recommendations to break that monopoly.
And that means that the major clearing banks will also be around for a long time to come.
"The United States is proud to stand with Turkey in good times or bad," the US president said.
They would be made available through 12 Turkish banks, the officials said.
The official crisis centre says 452 people were killed and 2,385 injured in the powerful quake, which struck the north-west of the country on Friday.
President Clinton will spend three days in Istanbul, where his programme will include tours of areas affected by last week's earthquakes and an earlier quake in August.
He will also be attending a summit meeting of leaders frommember countries of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which opens on Wednesday.
The US president will meet survivors of August's earthquake in Izmit on Tuesday.
Izmit, the epicentre of the first quake, is just 100km from the second quake's epicentre and was rocked by Friday's tremors.
Some 72 hours after the earthquake struck, rescue teams are still hoping that they might find someone alive amid the piles of masonry and mounds of rubble.
Officials are also concerned about the tens of thousands of survivors who lack adequate shelter against rain and freezing overnight temperatures.
More high-quality winter tents are said to be urgently needed.
Correspondents say the government's response has been much faster than it was after August's quake.
Some 4,000 Turkish soldiers have been mobilised, and emergency plans are already in place.
International rescue teams from the US, UK, Greece, France, Germany and Italy have joined Turks in the hunt for survivors.
Transport Minister Enis Oksuz said the quake could cost Turkey's fragile economy $10bn - on top of the $12bn from August's disaster.
Travelling along Montenegro's mountainous coastline, with its neat beaches and stone built towns dotted all over a truly spectacular landscape, the thought of a civil war seems unreal.
But it's an increasing possibility today in Montenegro, where tensions with its powerful neighbour, Serbia, have been dramatically rising over the past eighteen months.
Montenegro's leader, Milo Djukanovic, is locked in a tense stand-off with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, threatening to leave the Yugoslav Federation unless Milosevic grants Montenegro greater powers.
Djukanovic was once a prot�g� of Slobodan Milosevic, who's now wanted for war crimes at the international criminal tribunal in The Hague.
There's an increasing sense of doom in Montenegro following the recent announcement by Slobodan Milosevic that he will seek re-election as Yugoslav President in polls on September 24th.
He claims that the SAS went to Montenegro in the aftermath of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia last summer.
Ivan, a softly spoken man in his late thirties, who fought for the Yugoslav Army during the wars that ripped the former federation apart, described why Milosevic established the battalion and what its orders would be if Montenegro were to seek independence from the Yugoslav Federation.
Steve Winter's image was captured during a 13-month quest to snap the perfect photo of the endangered species in its hostile habitat high in the mountains of Central Asia.
The competition, now in its 44th year, is run by BBC Wildlife magazine and London's Natural History Museum.
The panel of judges spent months shifting through more than 32,350 entries before deciding on the winners.
"Everything comes together in this striking picture," said judge Mark Carwardine on Mr Winter's image.
The picture of an elusive snow leopard, captured at an altitude of more than 13,000ft in India's Ladak's Hemis High Altitude National Park, was the reward for 13 months of effort for Steve Winter, a photographer for National Geographic magazine.
"I try to do stories that have never been done before," he told BBC News.
"It was collaboration between myself, the team and the snow leopard," he joked.
Working in such harsh conditions, where temperatures plummeted to -40C (-40F), he asked the manufacturers for their advice on the performance of the cameras in extreme temperatures.
"I used to hate these cameras because they just gave you a record of an animal.
"So I asked myself that if I did not like these cameras, how can I like them more.
This photo showing a young male lion harassing a thirsty giraffe at a waterhole in Namibia has won this year's Young Photographer of the Year prize.
It was taken by teenager Catriona Parfitt during a family safari holiday in 2007.
"When the giraffe first arrived, it was very nervous," Catriona explained.
She added that perhaps the young lion saw a solitary giraffe as too much of a temptation to leave alone, despite the risks.
Italian Stefano Unterthiner's photo of a mischievous Sulawesi black-crested macaque won the competition's Animal Potraits category.
The monkey earned his nickname "trouble-maker", Stefano explained, because it was more interested in the photographer than being photographed.
After spending weeks following the monkeys in the Indonesian island's Tangkoko National Park, Stefano found that their search for food took them to the coastal edge of the park's forest.
While most of the primates were busy foraging among the rocks for fallen fruits and nuts, one young adult took an interest in Stefano's activities.
He told BBC News that the photo was just a glimpse of a struggle between a tree-frog and cat-eyed tree-snake that lasted for hours through the night in the tropical forests of Belize.
"The snake had failed to get its jaws around the whole of the frog's head," he recalled.
Neither of the creatures showed any sign of giving up in the three hours that David sat in a cramped position.
When he returned in the following morning, there was no sign of the pair and no clue to which had finally broken the deadlock.
To capture this image, Antoni found a carcass of a moose, which had been hit by a train, knowing that it would be ideal bait for his subjects.
Five hours later, waiting in the sub-zero temperatures of the Polish winter, a struggle broke out between an adult male white-tailed eagle and a young male.
Capturing the shot, Antoni knew the snowy backdrop would help make the photo an award winning image.
He has announced that his charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is making a $100m grant to tackle the issue of Aids in India.
The announcement, however, has been overshadowed by a row caused by a US report which estimates that the number of people in India with HIV will multiply more than five times in the next decade.
But Mr Gates and the US Ambassador in New Delhi, Robert Blackwill, were accused by the Indian Health Minister of "spreading panic" among the general public by talking about dramatic increases in HIV-Aids cases.
The Gates Foundation money will be targeted at mobile groups such as truck drivers, migrants and labourers who are seen as particularly vulnerable to HIV infection.
Bill Gates said that the money would also be used to tackle the social stigma attached to Aids in India.
But on Friday Indian Health Minister Shatrugan Sinha described the US projection that the number of people living with HIV-Aids could rise from the current level of 4 million people to 25 million by 2010 as "completely inaccurate".
The world's richest man is being treated like a visiting head of state during his visit to India.
In addition to his meeting with the Prime Minister, Bill Gates is due to meet with the President of India, Abdul Kalam.
He will also meet leading figures from India's burgeoning information technology industry when he visits the country's centres of IT in Bangalore and Hyderabad.
Mr Gates is expected to make some announcements about new investments in India by his company, Microsoft, but none has been confirmed.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had documented "numerous cases of mistreatment of detainees," similar to those reported in Iraq.
The group said it had repeatedly warned Washington about the problems.
The United Nations has meanwhile warned that trust in US forces in Afghanistan is at risk if the allegations are not properly investigated and made public.
HRW say the deprivations suffered by prisoners include sleep deprivation, exposure to freezing temperatures, severe beatings, and detainees being stripped and photographed naked.
The charges come a day after the US announced it was investigating allegations of abuse by an Afghan police officer who was detained in 2003.
Former police colonel, Sayed Nabi Siddiqui, 47, was quoted by the New York Times as saying he was subjected to sexual abuse, taunting and lack of sleep while being held at a US base in Gardez, east of the capital Kabul.
Mr Siddiqui told the newspaper he was wrongly detained on 15 July after reporting police corruption.
In March, a HRW report said the US detention system in Afghanistan violated international law.
The group is now calling for the immediate release of details regarding these deaths.
"It's time now for the United States to publicise the results of its investigations of abuse, fully prosecute those responsible, and provide access to independent monitors," HRW's Afghan researcher, John Sifton, said.
The UN has also criticised the treatment of the prisoners using words which the BBC's Andrew North in Kabul says were couched diplomatically but whose meaning was clear.
UN spokesman Manoel de Almeida de Silva said that he had been receiving reports of violations for the past two years.
Both the UN and HRW have backed calls by Afghan human rights organisations for access to carry out checks on detainees in US custody.
At least 300 people, the majority of them Afghans, are believed to be held at the main US base at Bagram, north of Kabul, and an unknown number at other sites.
The fare structure is simple - you pay one price for a journey and double the price for a return.

The Typhoon, the RAF's frontline fighter jet, has been based at RAF Coningsby since last October.
The five-year contract will also see BAE Systems staff at Samlesbury and Warton in Lancashire maintain and develop the plane.
The Typhoon programme already directly employs 16,000 people across the country.
Junior defence minister Quentin Davies said the Ministry of Defence had signed a five-year contract with BAE Systems.
"The programme is very important to the UK from both the military and industrial perspective," he said.
Store representatives warned the industrial walkout would deter potential shoppers.
About five million people shop around Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street daily, with 250,000 people passing through Oxford Circus station.
Some analysts have estimated the Tube strike could cost the London economy up to �50m a day.
"With the congestion on the buses people are just avoiding coming in to the centre of London," said Jace Tyrell, of the New West End Company, which represents stores in the Oxford Street area.
But business groups warned the effects of the RMT's strike action could have a much bigger impact.
"A three-day strike will obviously cost sales on those days but they may be made up on other days," said Richard Dodd, from the British Retail Consortium.
Business group London First attacked the union for bringing the Tube network to a virtual halt.
The strike by the RMT, which has closed two-thirds of the Tube network and affected 10 lines, is over pensions and jobs following the collapse of maintenance firm Metronet.
Robbie Maddison performed a no-handed backflip as he jumped the gap between the north and south side of the bridge at 0255 BST.
The stunt came ahead of his performance at Battersea Power Station as part of the Red Bull X-Fighters World Tour.
"We had a matter of minutes on the bridge and had to time everything to the second - there were so many factors to get right, but we pulled it off.
Nato military commanders have yet to fix the precise numbers of additional troops that will actually be sent to Macedonia.
The extra UK forces made available to Nato are in addition to 5,400 already deployed inMacedonia and the 1,600 others committed to Kosovo operations.
It was still the alliance's wish that the troops would go in as part of an agreement with Belgrade to allow the refugees to return home, he said.
Earlier Prime Minister Tony Blair had told the Commons that Nato's decision to increase the size of the Kosovo force was "significant and right".
Mr Robertson's announcement was met with a blistering attack by the Tories on the government's handling of the Kosovo conflict.
Shadow Defence Secretary John Maples said Mr Robertson's statement did nothing to endthe "confusion at the heart of government policy" on Kosovo.
Mr Maples said his party was as committed as the government to achieving Nato's aim of ending ethnic cleansing.
Mr Maples claimed the government had been portraying the forces in Macedonia to the media asthe basis of a possible invasion force.
Other Nato allies, most notably the US saw things entirely differently, he said.
"Whatever happened to rapid reaction? It is nine weeks since thebombing started and only 14,000 of the troops are in place in Macedonia.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has spent Tuesday on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of Italy, France and Germany to try to smooth over these disagreements on strategy.
But Mr Maples said that the divisions meant that for now all of Nato's hopes appeared to be being pinned on the air campaign.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who has called for ground troops to enter Kosovo as soon as possible, welcomed the commitment of extra forces.
He said it would give Nato the resources to make good on its pledge to end ethnic cleansing and to get the refugees home - by force if necessary.
"We have invested what until now has been declaration with the means to make it a reality," he said.
The role of Nato's forces could now go "from peace-keeping to peace-making".
Cheryl Roberts, 61, pretended to be a 14-year-old girl and was asked by David Roberts, 68, to meet for sex.
Roberts admitted engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and making and possessing illegal images.
He was given a three-year community order and banned from having access in person or online to under 18s.
The couple have now split up and are getting divorced.
The court heard that mother-of-two Mrs Roberts became suspicious about the amount of time her husband was spending in his study and of a message which popped up on their computer while he was out.
While Roberts was chatting online in his study, Mrs Roberts used a different computer in the living room at their home in Pantygog, Bridgend, and pretended to be a schoolgirl.
Roberts propositioned the "girl", unaware he was chatting to his wife, the court was told.
Prosecutor Martyn Kelly told the court that Roberts, a former pub landlord who used the nickname 'Corky' online, also used a webcam to film himself carrying out acts of indecency - which his wife could see on her PC just yards away.
Mrs Roberts was so shocked by the behaviour of her husband of almost 20 years she brought in police, who seized his computer and found dozens of illegal child porn images.
Roberts believed he had been caught through downloading the images and did not know until weeks later that it was his wife who had called the police.
The court heard that, when interviewed, Roberts denied having sex with any schoolgirls but admitted he was "prepared to do so".
Psychiatrists' reports said Roberts might have a brain disorder which causes him to be an exhibitionist.
Mr Broadstock said Roberts had been going through a dark patch at the time, was anxious to know why he had behaved in that way and would welcome treatment.

Wolverine made headlines this weekend by raking in more than £58 million at the US box office.
That's even after a copy of it was leaked onto the internet a month ago.
The film, which stars Hugh Jackman and tells the story of a mutant who becomes a wolverine, was only expected to make £47 million in its first weekend of release.
It exceeded expectations at a time when many don't have a lot of cash in their pockets.
And then there's Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince and Transformers 2 which are also expected to make big money at the box office.

In America's toughest and longest recession in the 1930s, cinema takings were also up as people tried to get away from the grim realities of life for an hour or two of escapism.

Defending Open champion Padraig Harrington says he is happy with the state of his game despite carding a final round of 73 to finish down the field on 12 over par.
Speaking in London, she appealed to the international community to help fund a scheme to pay poor farmers to protect trees instead of cutting them down to grow drug crops.
The problems of logging and cattle ranching are well known - much less widely recognised is the influence of the cocaine trade.
Eighty per cent of the world's supply of the drug comes from Colombia, and Dr Rodriguez said 70% of this was now grown in the Amazon region.
The area of former forest under cultivation has quadrupled in the last decade - coca farmers have to keep cutting down more trees as the soil is starved of nutrients within two years.
The minister said the new Colombian Government was launching a policy called Trees for Drugs, under which poor farmers would be paid to protect the forest instead of growing coca and she called for international funding to help with this.
A wider appeal was made at the conference by the campaigner Bianca Jagger, who urged richer countries to create a fund to help South American governments preserve the Amazon.
We must not allow the narrow margin of victory to become a source of greater conflict in society.
Thus, I hereby pledge to listen, to understand, to abide by laws and reasoning, and to strive to unify the people of Taiwan - so as to dissipate the animosity engendered by the campaign and rebuild a "bridge of trust" between the governing and opposition parties.
Faced with an ever-increasing military threat from across the Strait, it is imperative for all the people, including political adversaries, to forge a strong will to defend ourselves, proactively strengthening our defence equipment and upgrading our self-defence capabilities.
With the new century upon us, let the leaders on both sides of the Strait, in striving to attain the greatest welfare for their peoples, heed this new trend by adopting a brand new frame of mind - together, let us take a fresh, unparalleled approach in addressing future cross-strait issues.
We can understand why the government on the other side of the Strait, in light of historical complexities and ethnic sentiments, cannot relinquish the insistence on the "One China Principle".
By the same token, the Beijing authorities must understand the deep conviction held by the people of Taiwan to strive for democracy, to love peace, to pursue their dreams free from threat, and, to embrace progress.
By building bridges, we will aim to close gaps and establish a foundation for mutual trust.
Our current Constitution was promulgated under circumstances that were very different from the society we know today, and the majority of the articles in the Constitution no longer address the present - much less the future - needs of Taiwan.
The promotion of constitutional re-engineering and the re-establishment of the constitutional order are tasks that correspond with the expectations of the people and are in accordance with the consensus shared by all political parties.
By the time I complete my presidency in 2008, I hope to hand to the people of Taiwan and to our country a new version of our Constitution - one that is timely, relevant and viable - this is my historic responsibility and my commitment to the people.
Taiwan's long-term friendship with the United States, Japan and our allies in the world has been founded on the safeguarding of our common interests.
Apple launched its new handheld mobile phone device under the iPhone name on Tuesday, at the hotly anticipated Macworld event in San Francisco.
Following the launch Cisco said it hoped to resolve the matter by Tuesday evening after negotiations.
Apple responded by saying the lawsuit was "silly" and that Cisco's trademark registration was "tenuous at best".
Cisco, which has owned the trademark since 2000, said it thought Apple would agree to a final document and public statement regarding the trademark.
"Cisco entered into negotiations with Apple in good faith after Apple repeatedly asked permission to use Cisco's iPhone name," said Mark Chandler, Cisco senior vice-president and general counsel, in a statement.
The firm has owned the name since it bought Infogear Technology in 2000, which registered the name.
Infogear had previously used the name for several years, said Cisco.
Cisco, which supplies networks, said it would seek to stop Apple from "infringing upon and deliberately copying and using" the trademark.
Cisco's Linksys arm has employed the trademark since early 2006, and in December it launched its own phone, capable of connecting to the internet, called the iPhone.
News of Apple's launch of its touch screen has been long awaited and Steve Jobs, the firm's head, said the phone would revolutionise the market.
Three men held in raids in Milan were suspected of trying recruiting people for Osama Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, said Italian Interior Minister Claudio Scajola.
No further details were given of the fourth arrest, which took place at an undisclosed location in Germany.
One report said a fifth man was being sought in France.
The suspects are said to be of Tunisian, Libyan and Egyptian.
At time of the April arrests, the Italian authorities claimed they had smashed the nerve centre of an Islamic group directly linked to the Al-Qaeda network and to Afghan training camps.
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the Italians have been keeping under surveillance a number of people from Arab countries who are also suspected of using business and financial contacts in Italy to provide logistical support to Islamic militants.
The arrests are the latest in a series of detentions across Europe of terrorist suspects, in the wake of the 11 September attacks in the US.
Italy has been on particularly high alert following the attacks, after a written warning from the US State Department that the country could be targeted by terrorists within the next few weeks.
Two suspects have also been extradited to France - Jamal Beghal, who had been arrested in the United Arab Emirates, and Kamel Daoudi, detained in the UK.
In the UK, an Algerian pilot has been charged with training four of the suicide hijackers who took part in the US attacks.
A CIA spokesman said the report was biased and distorted, and that the agency had operated lawfully.
Swiss Senator Dick Marty, who wrote the report, said secret CIA prisons "did exist in Europe from 2003 to 2005, in particular in Poland and Romania".
The charge was denied by both Polish and Romanian officials.
Romanian senator Norica Nicolai, who headed an investigation into the allegations, also denied his country's involvement.
"All statements made by Dick Marty are totally groundless," he said.
A spokesman for the CIA told the BBC that the agency's "operations have been lawful, effective, closely reviewed and of benefit to many people - including Europeans - by disrupting plots and saving lives".
Mr Marty - working on behalf of the Council of Europe, a human rights body - has been investigating the CIA's "extraordinary renditions" programme, under which terror suspects were transported around the world for interrogation.
In his report, he said a secret agreement among Nato allies allowed the CIA to operate the camps.
Unnamed CIA sources quoted by Mr Marty said Poland was the "black site" where eight "high-value detainees (HVDs)" were interrogated, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001.
The report says Romania "was developed into a site to which more detainees were transferred only as the HVD programme expanded".
"The secret detention facilities in Europe were run directly and exclusively by the CIA," the report says.
But it said "the highest state authorities" knew of the CIA's activities.
A report approved by a European Parliament committee earlier this year said more than 1,000 covert CIA flights had crossed European airspace or stopped at European airports in the four years after the 9/11 attacks.
US President George Bush admitted last year that terror suspects had been held in CIA-run prisons overseas, but he did not say where the prisons were located.
A team from US universities found HRT can help women who have not yet shown signs of dementia.
And it found women over 85 seemed to benefit most from the therapy.
Age affects how the brain works in areas such as memory, attention-span and language.
Previous studies looking at the effects of HRT on slowing down the rate of decline have been mixed, with some showing HRT does have beneficial effects, and others showing none.
The US study looked at over 2,000 women, aged 65 and over.
Information about the women's social and occupational status, their psychiatric and medical history was recorded.
Whether they had a healthy lifestyle was assessed by asking if they used multivitamins and calcium supplements.
The women, all from Cache County, Utah, were followed for three years, and monitored for changes in thinking, learning, depression - and their use of HRT.
They were asked if they were using HRT, had used it in the past or had never used it.
Allowing for these effects, it was found that HRT use was linked to better cognitive scores at the first assessment and with less decline in scores by the time of the follow up assessment at the end of the study.
How the hormone treatment did this was not clear but researchers said HRT could make a genuine difference to women's lives.
How long HRT was used for, or whether the women were still using it did not seem to affect results.
Dr Michelle Carlson, of Johns Hopkins University, said the study showed an apparent benefit of taking HRT on the cognitive function in non-demented older women.
But the researchers say more work needs to be done to confirm their conclusions because of the unusual nature of their study group.
All the women live in a geographically-isolated close-knit community.
Ninety per cent are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints, which prohibits alcohol and tobacco use, which could mean the women are healthier than an average population.
Further studies looking at the effect of HRT on Alzheimer's and cognitive decline are underway.
A lecturer in clinical psychology at University College London, Dr Linda Clare, told BBC News Online she welcomed the Cache County study as an important contribution to the area of research.
But she said it would need to be backed up by clinical trials.
While the Christmas period is traditionally the time of year for the blockbuster game to be released, the start of 2011 is set to be awash with big titles, even if they are not groundbreaking in subject matter or ambition.
Marc Cieslak plays with the new releases and looks ahead to what could be the big games of early next year.
House sparrow sightings have also declined, though less steeply.
But some other species, including tropical birds that have escaped from captivity, are spreading further afield.
The findings, published by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), are the result of observations by more than a quarter of a million people.
All took part in the RSPB's 2002 Big Garden Birdwatch, held during the last weekend in January.
The RSPB asked participants to spend an hour counting the birds in their garden, school grounds or local park, and to record the highest number of each species seen at any one time.
But behind the bare figures lies a more intriguing story - why some birds are doing well and others are not.
"We began to get reports in the mid-1990s that people were seeing fewer of both species, and we didn't take too much notice to start with.
"But now these Birdwatch figures are showing that they were right all along.
Another surprise from the survey is the absence of the ubiquitous magpie from the top 10.
"They've settled in the wild in their thousands, although they're a tropical species brought here as caged birds.
Britain's most senior Jewish leader said the Synod's vote was "ill-judged" and would "hurt Israel without helping the Palestinians".
Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks told the Jewish Chronicle the move could damage Jewish-Christian relations in the UK.
The Church said the decision was only advice to its ethical advisory group.
The effect of the Synod vote would be the opposite, he added.
That decision followed a call from the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East for the Church to "disinvest from companies profiting from the illegal occupation, such as Caterpillar Inc".
The Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams voted in favour of reopening talks after complaints that the company's bulldozers have been used to knock down Palestinian homes.
The Archbishop has already written to the Chief Rabbi telling him that no decision about the Church's investment had been taken so far.
Looking into the issue did not "question the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its rights to self-defence", he said in the letter.
Dr Williams expressed "deep regret" at the effect on Jewish people of how the Synod's decision had been perceived and stressed that the vote did not intend or effect a disinvestment policy or a boycott.
It was rather, he said, an expression of disquiet at the prospect of the Church making financial profit from a controversial security policy.
Dean of Southwark Reverend Colin Slee said the decision was "not a case of picking on Israel".
"This is a continuing process of re-examining ethical investment and seeing whether we're behaving as we should," he told Newsnight.
The Council for Arab-British Understanding said one of the main reasons for the Synod's decision to review its investments was the Israeli policy of demolishing Palestinian homes in West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have been occupied by Israel since 1967.
Israeli soldiers have demolished 4,100 Palestinian homes since September 2000, according to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.
A spokesman for Caterpillar said its products were sold to the US government which had then sold them on to Israel.
"We clearly have neither the legal right nor the tangible ability to regulate how customers use their machines," he added.
Humphrey Lyttelton on Samantha's exploits
What followed was often so smutty that the BBC felt it could only be heard on Sunday lunchtimes, weekday early evenings, and by millions of people who would otherwise claim not to know a single dirty joke.
Equally startled was Lyttelton, who every week managed to seem the victim rather than the perpetrator, a nice old man who had been slipped a verbal whoopee cushion by the impertinent comics he was reluctantly forced to keep in line.
So while it might not have looked like a performing style, it was a very good one.
David Benson, an actor who has written and performed one-man West End shows about Kenneth Williams and Frankie Howerd, says performers have capitalised on their audience's reaction in different ways.
Those comedians are long gone, and were it not for Lyttelton, it would be easy to think of British innuendo as being a century or so of history that first got its end up in the music halls, rubbed up against some saucy postcards along the way, then had a final, brilliant (de)flowering with Private Widdle and co in the Carry On films.
By the time Porridge came on screen in the 1970s, there was much more sexual innuendo permitted, but swearing was still tightly controlled, so a new word - "nerk" - had to be invented as a term of abuse.
But in societies that now talk about little except sex, do we still even need innuendo?
The fact that Benny Hill's character Ernie, the fastest milkman in the West, "gets his cocoa" with Sue three times a week means that a tale of promiscuity and murder sits comfortably on my two-year-old daughter's music compilation, along with Nellie the Elephant and You're a Pink Toothbrush - although Graham Norton could do wonders with the latter.
Cryer says there was a reaction against the innuendo-filled 60s and 70s, and a feeling that "why don't they say what they mean?" But he says that missed the point - the best innuendo still works because the audience admires its skill and enjoys working out the meaning.
He says Lyttelton's air of innocence, and his immense popularity, enabled him to take the curse off what he was saying - meaning that he defused the content - but it may also be true that he took the curse off innuendo itself for those who'd come to think of it as naff (another Porridge-ism used in place of ruder words).

McKay is the Irish light-heavyweight champion but is delighted to move down in weight to tackle unbeaten Lee.
"With the greatest of respect to some of his opponents they weren't there to win," said McKay, who has lost only one of his 19 professional bouts.
Saturday's bout will take place at the National Stadium.
McKay says the fight offers him a great opportunity to take a major step forward in his career.
"I've been looking for a big fight like this for ages," added.
"There was talk of me maybe fighting John Duddy at one point and then I was matched with Matthew Macklin for the Irish title but that fell through as well.
During his amateur career, McKay defeated John Duddy in the Ulster Championships.
Lee won a European Amateur Championship bronze medal in 2004 and also competed in the Olympic Games in Athens in the same year.
However, McKay insists that the Limerick man has yet to be tested in the pro ranks.
Lee's victims include a former world champion Carl Daniels but McKay was not overly impressed by that win.
"When Carl Daniels was in his prime Andy was still in diapers," added McKay.
The County Down man also has a strong argument for claiming that he too should still have a perfect record.
His sole blemish came in November of 2004 when he was on the wrong end of a controversial points decision to Paul Buchanan.
In the build-up to this weekend's fight, McKay has sparred with Howard Eastman and Brian Magee.
Lee acknowledges that McKay should present him with a tough test.
"I've seen Jason a couple of time and he's very solid," said Lee.
"He does all the fundamentals very well so it has the makings of a great fight.
The bill also sees Eugene Heagney and Colin Moffett clashing for the Irish bantamweight title in a re-match of their July contest when Heagney edged a tight verdict.
The 21-year-old former Livingstone forward was a key player for United last season making 34 appearances scoring 11 goals.
"I am delighted to get it done," Snodgrass told the club's website.
Leeds United are believed to be close to making a fifth summer signing with Liverpool winger Adam Hammill understood to be a target.
Barnsley have had a bid accepted for the 21-year-old midfielder who had a loan spell at Oakwell last season.
Hammill also had a successful loan period at Blackpool when current Leeds manager Simon Grayson was in charge at Bloomfield Road.
The 18-year-old from Cape Town won golds in the 50m and 100m disabled freestyle swimming events, breaking two world records on the way.
Du Toit competed as a highly-promising 14-year-old at the last Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur four years ago.
But her life was tragically altered in February of last year when she lost her left leg at the knee in a motorbike accident.
She was back in the pool by May, before she had even relearned to walk and made the Commonwealth Games a distant target.
"Natalie is a truly remarkable individual who deserves our full admiration," said Mike Fennell, Chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation.
All 72 competing nations and territories nominated one athlete for the award with the winner chosen by a panel consisting of the six Commonwealth regions.
The panel decision in favour of Du Toit was unanimous.
Du Toit said in Manchester she is not sure what her swimming future holds.
She has been impressed by the integration of the disability events into the schedule, with the medals counting in the official table.
Du Toit must now decide whether to pursue disability swimming or keep pushing to compete with her able-bodied team-mates.
"I always imagine myself to be the same person as before the accident," she said.
Du Toit was introduced to the Queen as part of a special athletes' welcoming party prior to Sunday evening's closing ceremony.
In a report, the UK-based agency concluded that some children were "wasting away from lack of food".
It said there was a shortage of 18,000 tonnes of food needed for January and urged world donors to increase aid.
The agency said innocent Zimbabweans should not suffer because of a political crisis out of their control.
"There is no excuse for failing to provide this food," said Lynn Walker, programmes director for Save the Children in Zimbabwe.
The agency said some five million people in Zimbabwe - or about 50% of the country's population - were now in need of food aid.
Zimbabwe's farming sector collapsed after President Robert Mugabe launched a controversial land reform programme more than five years ago.
As well as suffering economic meltdown, Zimbabwe is experiencing a cholera outbreak, fuelled by the collapse of its health, sanitation and water services.
Aid agencies have warned that the disease, which has already claimed more than 1,100 lives, could infect more than 60,000 unless its spread is halted.
Speaking at a conference in Washington, he urged campaigners to focus on the positives of cutting carbon emissions rather than making people feel guilty.
The movement must change its image just as he helped transform the "sketchy" reputation of bodybuilding, he said.
California is seen as leading the way in tackling climate change in the US.
The state - the sixth largest economy in the world - signed a law last year that set a target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020.
And while Mr Schwarzenegger cannot stand for president in 2008 because he is not US-born, he has made it clear he wants his views on climate change to play into the race.
Addressing a largely student audience at Georgetown University, Mr Schwarzenegger said he was optimistic attitudes to the environment were changing.
But, he said, campaigners on climate change needed to shake off the image of being "tree-huggers" and "fanatics".
"Environmentalists were no fun; they were like prohibitionists at a fraternity party," he said to laughter.
The Republican governor - the former body-builder turned film-star turned politician - invoked images of "pumping iron" to make his point.
Weight-lifting was once considered a pursuit for weirdos, he said, carried out in dungeon-like gyms by people embarrassed to admit to doing it.
But with positive marketing "it became mainstream, it became sexy, attractive, and this is exactly what has to happen with the environmental movement", he said.
The same thing happened when the John Travolta film Saturday Night Fever made disco-dancing hip and sexy, he added, reaching even his little village in Austria.
Mr Schwarzenegger, who has been criticised in the past over his fleet of Hummers, pointed out that his vehicles now run on bio-fuel and hydrogen.
He rebuffed criticism from US carmakers, saying the fact they had to meet Californian standards on vehicle emissions would ensure they kept up with foreign competitors.
And he urged campaigners to move away from using guilt to pressure people over greenhouse gas emissions.
"Successful movements aren't built on guilt, they are built on passion," he said.
He believes the environmental movement is approaching a "tipping point" where it will enter the mainstream, galvanising business and individuals.
And California was leading the way, Mr Schwarzenegger said, especially as Republicans and Democrats were working together to pass pioneering legislation on the environment.
"California is big, it's powerful and what we do in California has unbelievable impact and it has consequences," he said.
The Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) reported that the number of people who had fallen behind with debt repayments had been steadily rising this year.
The debt charity blamed a slowing economy and firms cutting back on overtime for the worsening situation.
If the economy continued to stagnate or went into recession the charity warned that increasing numbers of people were likely to face problems servicing their debt.
According to the Leeds-based charity, last autumn the number of their clients unable to keep up with their tailored debt management plans was at a record low level.
At present the charity has 30,000 people on debt management plans and receives 150,000 calls a year from people in debt.
The charities warning comes hot on the heels of the Bank of England announcement that unsecured borrowing in the UK had reached record levels.

The annual open writing contest began in 1973 as a fundraiser for Bridport Arts Centre.
Alongside poetry and short stories, the 2010 competition introduced a new category, flash fiction - a complete story of less than 250 words.
The winners of the contest will be announced on 31 October at the Bridport Literary Festival.
Frances Everitt, co-ordinator of the competition since 2002, believes the competition has now earned a strong international reputation with entries from over 75 countries.
Frances has also been a reader for the first time.
She was one of a team of 12 whittling down the entries to create a short-list from which the judges would choose their winners.
The short-listing process takes several months to complete, after the deadline for entries at the end of June.
There is also recognition for best entry from a local writer, the Dorset Prize.
Frances said she was particularly impressed with the response to the contest's new category of flash fiction - especially from writers in Dorset.
The category attracted over 2,500 entries in total.
All of the winners have now been chosen by the team of judges which includes Zoë Heller and Michael Laskey.
The awards ceremony takes place on 31 October at the Bridport Arts Centre theatre.
The future of the event remains in doubt after Donington Park failed to raise funds needed to stage the race.
Silverstone wants to host the event on a long-term deal, but fears remain that F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone could opt for a more lucrative deal elsewhere.
"To lose the British Grand Prix would be massively damaging," said Whitmarsh, McLaren's team principal.
"Any team in F1 knows the importance of the British Grand Prix, it's about the quality of the fan base that you experience.
"The world championship is 18, 19 or potentially even 20 races, so I guess you couldn't say any of them are absolutely vital, but I think to lose a British Grand Prix would be massively damaging to the sport.
But Damon Hill, president of the British Racing Drivers' Club that owns Silverstone, is not convinced the race will be staged at the Northamptonshire track and says it faces stiff competition from other venues around the world.
The proposed move to Donington Park was announced in July 2008, but a deadline passed on Monday for the company redeveloping the circuit to prove it had the £135m funding required.
In June, Ecclestone said there would definitely be a British GP in 2010 and it would be at Silverstone if Donington failed to come through.
But more recently he has backtracked and said it is not certain there will be a grand prix in Britain next year at all.
Hill says Ecclestone, who has long criticised the lack of investment in upgrading Silverstone, could take up the chance to earn more money elsewhere by giving the slot in the calendar to a country such as South Korea, which is on the provisional grand prix list for 2010.
The British GP was almost dropped in 2005 because of a dispute between Ecclestone and the BRDC, which refused to pay the race fee he had demanded.
The race was left off the provisional race calendar but was reinstated after negotiations produced an agreement.
Silverstone has hosted every British Grand Prix since 1987, while Donington, which is synonymous with MotoGP, has held only one F1 race, the European Grand Prix in 1993.

The continuing Marjah offensive is an important test both for Western and Afghan military forces.
But it will also test the Afghan government's ability to deliver speedy governance and provide services to people in areas dominated by the Taliban for years.
The make-up of "the government in a box" promoted by US commanders is precisely what was missing when the first Provincial Reconstruction Teams were set up outside Kabul in 2002.
There was no countervailing Afghan authority to provide services to the people after Western forces were deployed.
That failure is only now being addressed.
Despite the promise of continued deployment of US and Nato forces, many population centres and agricultural regions have to be cleared and held in the months ahead if the Taliban are to be decisively rolled back - particularly around Kandahar and Kabul.
Manpower still appears limited and careful decisions will have to be made as to what areas are important because not every area will be possible to clear.
There is still a strong belief in Washington that before any dialogue between Kabul and the Taliban can take place, Western forces have to diminish the militants' capabilities.
But a series of reported arrests of senior Afghan Taliban leaders in Pakistan has opened another intriguing front.
The US is yet to be convinced that the arrests signal a major U-turn by the Pakistani military, which has been accused of harbouring militants since 2002.
On the face of it, for Pakistan to abandon them just as a major offensive unfolds against the Taliban in Afghanistan would be enormously beneficial.
However, instead there is growing concern that the Pakistan military and its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is hardening its terms for a major say in a new round of the Afghan political merry-go-round, as power-brokers prepare for an end to the conflict in the next 18-24 months.
Senior US officials say the arrest of the powerful second-in-command Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, in Karachi in early February was accidental, after the CIA pinpointed the location of a meeting of Taliban commanders where Baradar was found.
The Pakistan military has admitted to holding only Baradar, although between five and eight other Taliban leaders have also been arrested.
Once the arrest was leaked several days after it took place, the Afghan government asked for Baradar and four other Taliban to be extradited to Kabul for questioning.
However, the Lahore high court restrained the government from handing them over to Kabul after a petition was filed by a retired ISI officer, Khalid Khawaja.
Despite repeated requests, US officials have been given only limited access to question Baradar and even less access to others under arrest.
In itself, the arrests have dealt a serious blow to the Taliban's long-term ability to counter the US-Nato offensive in southern Afghanistan.
Baradar was the key logistician and overall political chief for Taliban commanders inside Afghanistan.
But despite his sanctuary, Baradar was at odds with the ISI over the issue of opening a dialogue with Kabul.
Kabul and the Taliban had enlisted the help of Saudi Arabia in this - but the ISI was not involved.
Over the past 12 months Saudi Arabia has been intermittently involved in helping the two sides hold informal talks that so far have not led to more serious negotiations, although they have the potential to do so.
Moreover, the Obama administration is still far from accepting the idea of negotiating with the Taliban leadership.
The US and Nato have agreed to fund the reintegration of Taliban fighters who want to give up arms, a key element of their current offensive - but not reconciliation.
Senior US officials were annoyed at Mr Karzai in the aftermath of the recent London conference when he went beyond reintegration to offer the Taliban leaders - including Mullah Omar - talks and reconciliation.
The Obama administration is divided over the issue of talking to Taliban leaders.
Politicians and civilian officials insist the Taliban have to be significantly diminished through military offensives over the coming year before any such talks between Kabul and Taliban leaders can be encouraged.
The US Defense Department is more sanguine, believing that talks could be held at the same time as the US military neutralises the Taliban.
All US officials agree that the Taliban has to first make a decisive break from their operational alliance with al-Qaeda.
Pakistan's fear of being superseded in any future negotiations stems from the belief that it has more at stake in a stable Afghanistan than any other neighbouring country.
There are twice as many Pashtuns living in Pakistan than in Afghanistan, and Pakistan is for the first time waging a successful war against its own Pashtun Taliban.
However, too overt a Pakistani role is likely to be rejected by Mr Karzai, Afghanistan's non-Pashtuns and civil society groups (currently opposed to talks with the Taliban), and even by many Taliban tired of fighting and who would like to end dependence on Pakistan.
Although Pakistan has legitimate security interests in Afghanistan, so do other immediate neighbours like Iran, the Central Asian states and near neighbours like India, China and the Arab Gulf states.
All of them would likely start interfering in Afghanistan if they see growing Pakistani influence.
As President Obama's deadline of July 2011 - to give more responsibility to the Afghan government to start a US withdrawal from Afghanistan - approaches, the war and peace making in Afghanistan is likely to get more complicated.
It aims to end "sick-note Britain" with the assessments, which could see the number of annual claimants fall by 20,000.
But people who receive the benefit have contacted the BBC News website to argue that the government's clampdown is unfair.
One such person says he is desperate to get back to work, but has found it impossible to get a job.
David Le Compte, 51, has been on incapacity benefit since he broke his leg in three places, two years ago.
Before the accident he was a truck driver and tried to get back to work after being signed off.
Mr Le Compte, from Thetford in Norfolk, says he was then sent to an interview, where he was asked what he would like to do as he could no longer drive trucks.
After saying he could perhaps work in an office he was sent details of truck driver jobs in Scotland, Leeds and Manchester.
Following another interview he was sent information sheets on how to become a truck driver.
Mr Le Compte said he has applied for 110 jobs but because he has been unemployed and on incapacity benefit for two years, no one will employ him.
"I have been for another medical and have been signed off for another two years, but all I have is �80 a week - you can't live on that.
Dr David Blowers worked as an assessor on the appeal panels for more than two years and says the test system does not work.
"I have seen people getting benefit who frankly shouldn't have received it and others who were not getting it who were frankly so sick it was a surprise they had come in.
"We have to find a way to help the people who want to work, introducing a new test like this is not the way.
There are now one million fewer people on benefits and numbers on incapacity benefit are falling for the first time in decades, a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said.
The government will be providing people with a more tailored approach to giving them the skills they need to get jobs, he added.
The survey helps mark the International Year of the Reef.

The French capital is among the favourites for the event, with much of the required infrastructure already in place following the World Cup in 1998.
France has not hosted the Games since 1924 but enjoyed a successful World Cup and will hold the World Athletic Championships in Paris this summer.
The Stade de France, which hosted the World Cup final, would be the centrepiece for the athletics events of any proposed Olympics.
The stadium seats 80,000 spectators and is easily accessible by public transport both from the city centre and the airport.
Sceptics, however, have argued the French have failed to convince the International Olympic Committee of its suitability as hosts.
Paris' ambitions of being the latest city to house the Games were rejected more than a decade ago when it was runner-up to Barcelona for the 1992 competition.
It then lost out to Beijing for the event in 2008.
This time around, competition will come from London, New York, Madrid, Moscow and Leipzig, with further bids expected from Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo and the Canadian city of Toronto.
A recent poll showed the French capital's bid has the backing of 97% of the French public.
The deadline for all submissions for the 2012 Games must be received by 15 July and the IOC will name the city hosts in Singapore on 6 July 2005.
Highlights - Jackson beats Adlington to claim World Record
"I'd been swimming well in training - to get a world record has blown me away," Jackson told BBC Radio 5 Live.
Wales' David Davies broke the British men's 400m free record to win gold.
Meanwhile, victory for Jackson means she qualifies automatically for the 400m free at this year's World Swimming Championships in Rome.
"I knew I had been swimming well, I'd been swimming fast in training but you never know how you are going to swim in competition," added Jackson.
"I knew it was going to be so tough coming here because Becky is swimming amazingly.
Adlington will have another chance to gain qualification for the event at the second trials in Scotland in June.
The Mansfield swimmer revealed she has found it difficult to cope with the pressure since winning two golds at last year's Olympics.
Garry Law emerged as the villain-turned-hero for Reivers, who grabbed their first win in 15 games.
Law squandered three easy penalty chances but made ample amends with the try that made all the difference.
Duncan Hodge had kicked Edinburgh into the lead before Steven Jones replied then converted after the only try.
Both sides looked nervous during the scrappy opening exchanges, with mistakes galore preventing fluent action.
Edinburgh earned the first scoring opportunity when the hosts were guilty of failing to release the ball in contact - and fly-half Hodge confidently slotted the 35-metre penalty.
That sparked some pressure from the visitors and they put together at least 12 well-controlled phases, only for hooker Dougie Hall to be bundled out of play.
And winger Matt Dey spilled the ball on the overlap following slick work by Hodge and Marcus Di Rollo.
Reivers hit back with a series of midfield surges featuring Gregor Townsend.
They pressured Edinburgh into giving away an offside penalty, but Law sent his effort sailing wide of the near post.
They suffered a further setback when Brendon Danial, who had already come on as a sub for Ben MacDougall, was forced off with a calf problem and replaced with Jones.
Reivers kept up the momentum, but Law made a hash of another simple penalty attempt.
And he sent his next kick crashing against the upright, the ball rebounding to safety.
Jones took over the boot duties and levelled the issue from close range after Ally Strokosch was spotted swinging a fist in his own danger zone.
Law's fortunes changed just after the restart when he scooted over for an excellent touchdown.
Reivers shipped the ball at speed from right to left, with Bryan Rennie's offload giving Law the time and space to squeeze in at the corner.
Jones slotted the conversion from a wide angle to open up a seven-point gap.
He was then at the centre of controversy when he was sinbinned for back-line offside - an offence that Reivers claimed they had been consistently the victim of themselves earlier in the game.
Two minutes later, referee Neil Paterson sent Edinburgh forward Matt Mustchin to the bin for a minor misdemeanour.
Edinburgh stepped up the pace in the dying minutes, but they were unable to break down the spirited home defence.
Venus failed to take two chances on the Russian's serve in the opening set and was made to pay for her profligacy as Petrova claimed the solitary break.
The American took an early advantage in the second but was then broken three times in an untypically timid defeat.
Third seed Caroline Wozniacki was made to work hard as she overcame Flavia Pennetta 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (4-7) 6-2.
It was a first win for Petrova over Venus who had lost in the pair's previous four meetings.
The 19th seed, who reached the semi-finals in 2003 and 2005, had to defend three match points in her win over home favourite Aravane Rezai in the previous round and showed impressive mental strength again.
After inching ahead with a break in the fifth game of the opener, she faced down two break points against her in the eight and tenth to see the set out.
At 30-0 on Williams' serve in the match's final game, it appeared she might have revived her opponent's hopes as she miscued a straightforward smash and netted a forehand.
But the 27-year-old produced a vicious forehand down the line to seal her win at the first time of asking.
Denmark's Wozniacki eventually outmuscled Pennetta in three hours despite the Italian hitting more than twice the number of winners.
The 19-year-old, who has fallen at the third round in each of her three previous appearances at the tournament, will play Francesca Shiavone in the quarter-finals.
World number 131 Scheepers had beaten Gisela Dulko, a player ranked 86 places above her, previously in her campaign as she became the first South African to reach the last 16 since Amanda Coetzer in 1997.
The 26-year-old may have been given hope of a higher-profile scalp as Denmentieva battled through a calf injury in her win over Aleksandra Wozniak in the previous round.
However, after an exchange of breaks in the opening two games, her ambitions were dented as Dementieva secured three successive breaks to take the opener.
Although the second was a tighter affair, Dementieva, who has won indoors in Paris already this season, secured the breakthrough as Scheepers looped a forehand long.
"After every match you lose, you are always disappointed," said Scheepers.
Kirilenko had knocked out defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the previous round, but was eventually ground down by Schiavone's accuracy and power as she slipped to a 6-4 6-4 defeat.
GM said it would run out of cash in the first half of 2009 if economic and market conditions did not improve.
GM said it would cut jobs and costs and has also suspended merger talks with Chrysler to focus on current issues.
It says about 3,600 workers will be laid off indefinitely early next year as production is slowed at 10 plants.
Ford meanwhile said it would cut salary-related expenses in North America by another 10%.
Ford, which will accelerate plans to produce fuel-efficient cars, said it was looking at various solutions to support its balance sheet.
The US automakers have called for an industry wide rescue package after facing increasing concerns over the levels of cash needed to continue operations in "difficult economic conditions".
Ford shares have fallen more than 70% in 2008, hitting a 26-year low in October.
GM warned on Wednesday the industry faced meltdown after a "near collapse" in demand for cars.
Some deals were being offered in the summer of 2007 that tracked at a percentage below the Bank of England's official Bank rate.
This means their interest rate has now turned negative, opening up the possibility that the lender should be paying the borrower.
But C&G, which is owned by the Lloyds Banking Group, said that its contracts made it clear that interest was payable only by the borrower and not the lender.
All these lenders are now part of the Lloyds Banking Group and so will also see interest fall to 0%.
This policy seemed to be backed up by a statement by the regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which had analysed some of these offers.
"Simply because a contractual rate of interest on a tracker product drops beneath zero does not mean that the lender is bound to pay the borrower the "negative" balance on a monthly basis or otherwise account for it to the borrower.
However Ray Boulger, of mortgage broker John Charcol, argued that the FSA was offering mixed messages.
He said that this view was not specifically addressed in the key facts section of a mortgage contract.
This opened the potential for some people to go to the Financial Ombudsman for a decision on whether the decision by Lloyds Banking Group not to pay interest to borrowers was fair or not.
Going to the ombudsman is free for consumers, although the savings made if a decision went in their favour would be small unless they had a very large mortgage.
These deals tracking below the Bank rate were sold as loss leaders at a time when lenders were trying to attract new customers.
In general, by definition, fixed-rate mortgages do not change when the Bank rate changes.
People whose home loans are tracker deals see their repayments move in line with the Bank of England's Bank rate.
However, some lenders have set a collar or floor on tracker deals that meant interest rates would not fall below a certain point even if the Bank rate falls.
These include Nationwide (collar at 2%), Norwich and Peterborough (3%) and Skipton (3%) building societies.
Rome's newest museum has opened its doors for the first time, and the most controversial exhibit is the ornate bed used by the Italian Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini.
Even after half a century of neglect Villa Torlonia remains a neo-classical masterpiece.
For 18 years, this leafy paradise sheltered one of the twentieth century's most brutalleaders.
The authorities in Rome say British and American troops wrecked the villa's interior when they captured the city in WWII.
Italy's foremost expert on fascism, Professor Emilio Gentili, deplores moves to humanise a ruthless leader whom he calls a monster.
Known as Il Duce, Mussolini was a one-time journalist who created Europe's first fascist state.
In the 1920s and 1930s he was praised for modernising Italy.
But he murdered political opponents and inspired his ally, Hitler, to even greater crimes against humanity.
One of his sons, Romano Mussolini, retraces the carefree years he spent there as a child under the watchful eye of a dictator who stopped at nothing.
"I have happy memories of living in the house", he recalls.
But for other Italians, it's a history project that has woken ghosts they would prefer to forget.
A judge in Paris has charged Mr Le Pen with being an apologist for war crimes and disputing crimes against humanity.
Mr Le Pen was charged after reportedly saying that the occupation was "not especially inhumane" in January 2005.
Mr Le Pen's lawyer told the French news agency AFP that it would be "very easy to defend" his client in court.
Wallerand de Saint-Just said the alleged remarks to France's right-wing Rivarol magazine were made informally after the interview had officially ended and were not meant for publication.
The lawyer added that the comments were not strong enough to constitute an offence.
Mr Le Pen was charged with "complicity in contesting crimes against humanity and complicity in justifying war crimes".
He said last year that it was "scandalous" he was not free to air his views.
If convicted, Mr Le Pen would still be able to appeal the verdict, postponing a final ruling until after the poll and allowing him to run.
Mr Le Pen, who founded the National Front (FN) party in 1972, has been convicted of racism or anti-Semitism on a number of occasions before.
A date for the trial has not been made public.
Massive volcanism 500 million years ago was thought to have covered over much of the planet's ancient features.
But work carried out at Imperial College London, UK, suggests a "volcanic catastrophe" is not needed to explain the look of Venus's surface.
The British team presented details of its research to a major science conference in Texas, US.
Scientists will have an early opportunity to examine the new ideas - Europe's Venus Express spacecraft is due to arrive at the planet next month for a two-year investigation of Earth's near-neighbour.
Researchers date planetary surfaces by looking at the distribution of their impact craters.
On most planets and moons, impact craters tend to be clustered on very old parts of the surface, due to the heavy bombardment that is believed to have taken place in the early Solar System.
One way to arrive at this result is by rapid resurfacing - the model long accepted by planetary scientists.
Timothy Bond and Mike Warner of Imperial College London have now thrown that theory into doubt.
Using computer modelling, they came up with a suite of possible scenarios that were compatible with the planet's cratering record and surface features.
"The transition from a high rate of resurfacing to a low rate could have lasted as long as two billion years," Timothy Bond told the BBC News website.
Previous work suggests the volcanic upheaval 500 million years ago covered up "almost all" of the ancient surface.
The models developed at Imperial College suggest about 26% of the planet's surface could be older than 700 million years.
The findings agree with new models of heat loss from the interior of Venus produced by Dr Richard Ghail, also of Imperial College.
Earth's surface is divided into many plates that move relative to one another on convection currents in the mantle below.
These processes, called plate tectonics, continually cool the Earth and keep it in balance - what scientists call a "steady-state".
However, Dr Ghail believes the surface features of Venus do not necessarily reflect the rate of plate tectonics on the planet.
"I think we're moving closer towards a steady-state model for Venus," Dr Ghail told the BBC News website.
The researchers presented their results here at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas.
Robin Peverett, 66, was given an 18-month suspended sentence after admitting nine counts of indecent assault on pupils aged 10 to 13 at Dulwich College Preparatory School, Kent, between 1969 and 1978.
His past came to light after he gave a television interview about ex-pupil Sophie Rhys-Jones.
It was stressed in court that Sophie Rhys-Jones, who became the Countess of Wessex after marrying Prince Edward last year, was not connected with the charges.
The allegations were made after one of Peverett's victims, a woman now aged 33, saw the interview and decided to tell police what had happened to her.
Peverett, from Battle, East Sussex, was awarded an OBE for services to education in 1995 and advised the government on education policy during the 1980s.
Prosecutor Brendan Finucane said the charges related to punishments he gave pupils during Latin lessons, fencing practice, drama productions and a narrowboat trip on the Norfolk Broads.
The former head was interviewed about the royal wedding because the Countess of Wessex was a pupil at his school until 1976.
But on Thursday Judge David Griffiths ruled the trial would go ahead and the former head teacher changed his pleas.
Mr Finucane said it was not until the school chaplain questioned his actions in 1978, after complaints from parents, that Peverett considered what he was doing.
Geoffrey Cox, defending, said his client's glittering career was in tatters.
"He would like to apologise to those pupils he affected," he added.
But it was significant that the last of the offences was committed in 1978, when corporal punishment was an accepted feature of school life.
And despite media attention surrounding his arrest last year no further complainants had come forward.
"I find the considerable delay in the case, combined with the fact that since 1980 you have applied yourself to the problem within the industry, can be seen as exceptional circumstances," he said.
The 20,000-tonne warship was greeted by well-wishers on Friday as she berthed at Northumbria Quay in North Shields.
Her 1,100 crew are taking a four-day break from training in the North Sea, allowing the ship to open to the public on Saturday between 1000 and 1600 GMT.
The Royal Navy's flagship vessel had its keel first laid down at the Swan Hunter shipyard in Wallsend.
The aircraft carrier will take part in a busy programme of events during the weekend.
The Reds went ahead on 52 minutes when a Fernando Torres strike was deflected against the post and John Pantsil sliced a clearance into his own net.
Fulham belatedly came out of their shell and had a Brede Hangeland header cleared off the goal-line.
And a point-blank save late on by Reds keeper Pepe Reina from Moussa Dembele helped secure victory for Liverpool.
The home side may have had to endure a nervous finish as Fulham produced their late rally but the Reds maintain the impetus, although maybe not the improvement in play, that manager Kenny Dalglish has engineered since taking over.
Dalglish sees signs of progress
It was the Scot's second win in five games and will have Reds fans looking up the Premier League table towards the European spots rather than over their shoulders at the relegation zone.
Fulham, who had looked comfortable for the most part, do not have that luxury as they lie four points from the bottom three after a game in which both teams struggled to find their passing game or rhythm.
Dalglish masterminded a 10-0 win over Fulham in 1986 in his first spell in charge as Liverpool manager and he almost got the perfect start as he renewed rivalries with the London club.
Raul Meireles slid a weighted ball through for Torres to control and slot past Cottagers' keeper David Stockdale, only for the assistant referee to rule the goal offside in a questionable decision.
Stockdale might have been beaten on that occasion but the 25-year-old, who had not been on the losing side in his previous eight first-team outings for Fulham this season, excelled as he played a big part in keeping his side level at Anfield.
The threatening Reds right-back Martin Kelly drove in a cross and a steered header from Meireles seemed destined for the bottom corner before the Fulham stopper palmed the ball wide at full stretch.
Stockdale also saved a 20-yard Steven Gerrard strike before he excellently tipped a well-struck Glen Johnson effort, after the defender had cut in from the left, over the bar.
The visitors had grown into their task of nullifying Liverpool and almost benefited when two chances came their way in quick succession.
Fulham forward Clint Dempsey intercepted a Kelly pass and had a left-foot drive parried by Reina before the ball was cleared.
Almost immediately, former Everton forward Andrew Johnson pulled a ball back from the by-line for the unmarked Dembele, who could only shoot straight at Reina from close range as a glorious chance went begging.
Hughes bemused by Liverpool luck
The defences appeared to have the upper hand as both teams lacked urgency, but the home side eventually broke the deadlock in scrappy style.
A Torres shot was deflected on to the post by centre-back Hangeland and, in the ensuing melee, Pantsil sliced an attempted clearance into his own net.
Dempsey had a volley from a Pantsil cross saved by Reina and ex-Reds midfielder Danny Murphy sent a free-kick wide for the visitors but Fulham struggled to break down the Liverpool defence.
The visitors threw centre-back Hangeland forward and the move almost paid off when he met a corner with a firm header which beat Reina, only to be cleared off the goal-line by Meireles.
The Cottagers again went close when Dempsey nodded down a Murphy free-kick for Dembele, whose snapshot was again saved by Reina as the Reds dug in to secure victory and extend Fulham's run to 30 games without a win at Anfield.

The 23-year-old beat American Webb Simpson one-up on the final green to become the first British golfer to reach the final for 70 years.
"If I play my game and play the shots that are in my bag, there's no reason why I can't win," said Ramsay.
The Aberdeen golfer meets John Kelly in Sunday's 36-hole final in Minnesota.
Ramsay had lost the 16th after being judged to have grounded his club in a hazard.
If Ramsay triumphs at the Hazeldine course, he will be the first Britain to lift the trophy since Harold Hilton 95 years ago.
He will also become the second successive European to win the title following on from Italian Edoardo Molinari's victory in 2005.
Ramsay was a member of last year's losing Walker Cup side but was left out of the singles.
The plucky Irishman has now won four of the last five frames but still has a large mountain to climb.
With four balls left on the table, Doherty then sinks a long brown and is now only one behind.
The momentum is now with the resilient fifth seed and Williams must regroup in the break otherwise his title hopes may disappear completely.
That was before he led England's rugby team to World Cup glory in Australia, lifting the country's first major sporting trophy for 37 years.
But after making that heady evening in Sydney his last Test outing, we look at how others viewed arguably England's greatest-ever player.
"All that bull of modern rugby that floats around the edges of a team's preparation, he just shoves it away.
Ian Humphreys and Ronan O'Gara landed a penalty apiece before Geordan Murphy's try put the Tigers 8-3 in front.
O'Gara cut the gap to 8-6 at the break but the European champions spurned a penalty in the second half and Ollie Smith's try sealed Leicester's win.
Munster still made the last eight as one of the two best runners-up.
From the moment Leicester centre Dan Hipkiss sliced through the Munster line from deep in his own 22 after just 30 seconds it was clear the Tigers were up for it.
And they took the lead after three minutes when Humphreys, younger brother of O'Gara's long-time rival for the Ireland number 10 shirt David, landed a penalty.
O'Gara missed a long-range kick after 11 minutes but the Munster number 10 was soon on target from in front of the posts after he had cut through from an inside pass.
However, Leicester were back in front within three minutes, claiming the first try of the night as Lewis Moody's fine pass gave Murphy the chance to finish in style.
Both teams were defying the wet and windy conditions to produce some fine rugby but as the game passed the half hour mark the rain began to hammer down.
O'Gara gave the crowd something to cheer when he judged the wind perfectly to trim the gap to two points with a penalty right on the stroke of half-time.
Leicester had held the upper hand physically during the first half and although Munster showed signs straight after the break of getting to grips with the visitors, the Leicester pack reasserted itself.
The Tigers eight earned Humphreys a chance to stretch the lead but he was off target with a 55th-minute penalty.
Five minutes later Munster bafflingly spurned the chance to take a kickable penalty in favour of a scrum and they immediately lost possession when the Leicester pack produced a massive shove to turn them.
It was a decisive moment and one that captain Paul O'Connell will regret for a long time.
Leicester re-established control and they stretched seven points clear when Smith stepped inside the cover and just managed to get the ball down for an unconverted try.
Munster launched a desperate late fightback but their best chance went when Leicester again disrupted an attacking scrum, and the Irish side will now have to win on the road in the last eight as they seek to defend their title.
"It is a fantastic place to come and play rugby, and I thought we showed in the first 10 minutes that we were not going to be intimidated.
"Leicester were hugely dominant up front - their pack performance was terrific - but there are two ways we can go now.
The former star arrived late for a flight home to Buenos Aires and reportedly caused a disturbance.
Maradona, 45 - who was in Brazil for a charity match - has had health and drugs problems in recent years.
Federal police spokesman Carlos de Melo said Maradona was released after being interrogated, and would return to Argentina later on Thursday.
Showing contempt to authorities is punishable in Brazil with up to two years in prison.
Maradona was not charged, although the Brazilian authorities have not ruled out such an action until a full investigation has taken place, Mr Melo added.
A door was broken during the incident, and Maradona reportedly said he would pay for the damage.
In 2000, the football governing body Fifa chose him and Brazilian Pele as the greatest players in the sport's history.
The Australian pop starlet - who was recently interviewed by Price - sent flowers to the service at the Brompton Oratory in London.
Thousands of fans mourned after the 34-year-old was found dead in his London flat last month.
Friends and guests at the ceremony included former Brookside actress Claire Sweeney, who was due to co-host BBC Choice's coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest with Price later this month.
Also at the South Kensington church were Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, Royle Family star Ralf Little, comic Jenny Eclair and presenter Claudia Winkleman.
Price's coffin, strewn with white lilies, was carried into the church by six pallbearers.
In contrast to the presenter's mixture of sarcasm and flamboyance, the Catholic mass was a sombre occasion with traditional hymns and requiems sung by the oratory choir.
In an emotional speech, BBC colleague Robert Nisbet - who found Price's body - described him as "one of the best friends I ever had".
He read out some of the hundreds of messages left on the show's website by grieving fans and recalled how Price was "sometimes infuriating, sometimes loving, occasionally a party animal, at other times a loner but always bright, always sharp and always Christopher".
Readings were given by Price's brothers, his 14-year-old nephew James and his 16-year-old niece, Josephine, who described the "huge helpings of warmth and fun" her uncle brought.
After the service, a tearful Sweeney described Price as a "lovely, caring friend" and said his death had come as a terrible shock.
The presenter's family had requested that well-wishers did not send flowers, although they stated they were acceptable if they were from "Kylie or someone equally famous and glamorous".
After the Mass, Price was cremated at a private ceremony at Mortlake Crematorium in south-west London.
A public memorial service will be held on 25 May at St Martin-in-the-Fields on London's Trafalgar Square, on the day he was due to host coverage of the Eurovision song contest.
Instead of flowers, people are asked to donate money to Price's favourite charity Crusaid, which raises money on behalf of people living with HIV and Aids.
Price started his career as a journalist in BBC local radio, moving to Radio Five Live and News 24 before joining BBC Choice.
Liquid News - an irreverent look at entertainment news - was being lined up to become one of the leading programmes on the proposed digital channel BBC Three.
After a trial lasting four years, the judges found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case that Mr Andreotti, seven times Italian prime minister and a senator-for-life, had had personal contact with Mafia bosses.
The acquittal was widely expected following a not-guilty decision in a separate murder trial in Perugia last month.
The BBC's Rome correspondent, David Willey, says this was the most important political trial in the history of Italy's post-war republic.
Mr Andreotti served in practically every Christian Democrat Italian government between the end of World War II and his retirement from active politics in 1992.
He was accused of being the Mafia's political godfather in Rome, exchanging votes in Sicily in return for near impunity for the Mafia's criminal activities.
Evidence against him had come mainly from Mafia turncoats.
A conviction could have carried a 15-year jail sentence for the 80-year-old politician.
This acquittal may not mark the end of Mr Andreotti's legal ordeal, however, as the prosecution is expected to appeal.
But Mr Andreotti's lawyers say they are happy with the verdict and consider him entirely vindicated.
Mr Andreotti had always said that he was framed by Mafia mobsters who wanted revenge for his government's crackdowns on organised crime.
"Certainly the so-called proof from the turncoats was notenough for a conviction," Mr Coppi told reporters.
Prosecutors had devoted much of their arguments in the closing days of the trial to defending the credibility of their star witness.
Doubts about Baldassare Di Maggio had grown after he admitted this month to killing a man while under state protection.
Last month Mr Andreotti was acquitted in another long drawn-out trial in which he was accused of complicity in the murder of a journalist killed by the Mafia 20 years ago.
The succession had long ago been settled in private by a family counsel of 18 senior princes from the ruling al-Saud family.
But new king, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz faces a number of major challenges that will affect the West.
The most visible of these is al-Qaeda linked terrorism, but others include creating jobs and dealing with the Israel-Palestinian and Iraqi conflicts.
For more than two years now Saudi Arabia has been battling a small number of well-armed militants.
They are intent on driving out Westerners and replacing the al-Sauds with an Islamic caliphate.
This week it has emerged that phone calls were made to Saudi Arabia by some of those suspected of involvement in last month's London bomb plots.
Crown Prince Abdullah is expected to continue his government's crackdown on the militants.
But he now has the full authority to also tackle corruption and extravagance in the royal family - an unpopular move with some princes, but one seen as essential to reforming this highly traditional kingdom.
Other pressing problems for the new king include creating jobs for thousands of restless school leavers, resolving the conflict in neighbouring Iraq and finding a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli problem.
The success or failure of Crown Prince Abdullah's reign matters to Britain.
Over 20,000 Britons live and work in Saudi Arabia.
It is a huge commercial and strategic partner and the continued flow of its oil to the west is vital to the global economy.
India was the first to impose the punitive measures, including a ban from 1 January on Pakistan's national airline from flying in Indian air space and a reduction by half of India's diplomatic staff in Islamabad and Pakistan's diplomats in Delhi.
Pakistan retaliated almost immediately, with similar restrictions.
The Indian sanctions were aimed at forcing Pakistan to take action against two Kashmir militant groups blamed for a suicide attack on India's parliament two weeks ago.
Tensions between the two neighbours have risen dramatically since the attack, which Delhi alleges was backed by Pakistani intelligence.
Announcing the sanctions, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh also said the movements of all Pakistani diplomats in India would be confined to the Delhi city limits.
Mr Singh said the government was taking the measures because of Pakistan's attempts to "dupe" the international community with "cosmetic measures and non-measures" against militant groups operating in its territory.
Mr Singh also said talks with Pakistan were currently out of the question.
"It's not practical at the moment, nor possible for talks," he told reporters after the security cabinet meeting.
Pakistan said it was concerned at the turn of events.
"The Pakistan Government is greatly disappointed and saddened at these steps because these will fuel the atmosphere of tension," foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan.
But he added that Islamabad had to respond in kind.
The United States has urged the two sides to meet, amid the biggest build-up of military hardware along their common border in almost 15 years.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence and fears are mounting of another conflict.
But Mr Singh also tried to play down fears of war.
India has already recalled its ambassador in Islamabad and says all cross-border bus and rail links will cease from 1 January.
Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes said earlier that a new deployment of Indian troops along the entire border with Pakistan would be complete in the next few days.
Pakistani military spokesman General Rashid Quereshi countered that India's decision to move large numbers of troops to the frontier was a matter of serious concern.
He said that Pakistan's armed forces had also taken what he termed appropriate measures, and there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that Pakistan was capable of defending itself.
Sporadic clashes have intensified along their common border amid a massive build-up of troops, missiles and fighter aircraft.
The designation freezes the US assets of the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad groups.
Pakistan has already frozen the groups' assets and arrested the founder of the Jaish group.
But Mr Singh said those actions as meaningless, reiterating Delhi's demand that Islamabad shut down the two groups for good.
Officials suspect the Russian Circus on Ice abandoned the animals after apparently running into losses.
Staff of the Indian firm which had invited the Russians to Mumbai have also vanished.
Animal rights activists say they are outraged by the incident.
The animals were abandoned and left in their cages in the care of a local minder, police say.
Tony Blair hob-nobs with heads of state - Homer hangs out in a dive bar.
So when Mr Blair is a father again next year, who should he look to as a role model?
At least that's according to Lancaster University psychology professor Charlie Lewis who reckons that cartoon character Homer is one of the best examples of modern fatherhood.
He says many fathers could learn from Homer's fondness for watching TV with his children, to whom he's utterly devoted.
"The main place where fathers interact with their children is in front of the telly - much like Homer Simpson.
Apart from Bart, Homer is father to girls Maggie and Lisa and spends much of his time chauffeuring them about.
Homer does of course have a fondness for beer and food at his favourite haunt, The Frying Dutchman, which he almost put out of business when it held an "all you can eat" competition.
He also forgets birthdays and eats with his mouth open.
Mr Blair is already showing Homer-like parenting qualities, says Prof Lewis.
Wild horses - or even wife Marge - can't drag Homer away from the telly.
He even let slip that he would rather have been watching the Scotland-England game than flying half way round the world to the heads of Commonwealth conference earlier this month.
According to Prof Lewis, this telly tendency is a good pointer to good parenting.
Prof Lewis said fathers in high-pressure jobs like Mr Blair's often could not spend as much time as they would like with their children.
Mr Blair even admitted as much at the Labour Party conference earlier this year.
A devoted husband, Homer leaves his wife Marge with few complaints - apart from those already mentioned.
But Adrienne Burgess, author of the book Fatherhood Reclaimed, said we should not rush to praise Homer as an icon of fatherhood.
While she admitted he was devoted to his kids, he was also a fool, reinforcing cultural stereotypes of fathers as buffoons.
She said a better cartoon role model for Mr Blair would be the Rugrats' Chazz Finster, father of Chucky.
The remains of around 650 people were uncovered during building work near St Andrew's Church in Cherry Hinton, Cambridgeshire, more than four years ago.
The vicar, the Reverend Chris Boulton, will hold a reburial service in the church graveyard once archaeologists have completed research on the bones.
The skeletons are believed to date back more than 1,200 years.
They were found on the site of what archaeologists think was a Saxon nunnery and religious community near the present church.
The vicar has also organised a thanksgiving service to be held in February for the lives of those unearthed.
Officers say they will clamp down on youths getting drunk and causing trouble at the event.
Patrols will be stepped up and mounted officers are being brought in during the run up to opening night on 20 May.
Insp Paul Mogg said "a range of tactics" will be used to stop drunken teenagers ruining the event for others.
"Traditionally there have been a minority of young people who bring alcohol to the opening night and in the past there have been occasions where we have had to deal with groups of drunk and abusive youths.
He added that police had not ruled out another "sting" operation, similar to one last summer, which targeted licensees selling alcohol to underage people.
Thieves took at least 18 animation cells from the film's production headquarters which showed scenes of the film's two main characters - the snowman and the young boy James.
It is thought the cells were stolen to order by or for someone with extensive knowledge of animation.
"They were due to be exhibited in Japan and Australia later this year and are of course irreplaceable.
"I am very saddened that these pieces will be lost to generations of people who love the film.
Mr Coates said the animation has been placed on a register of stolen art and police have carried out forensic tests at the building.
The Snowman, which is an adaptation of Raymond Briggs's classic wordless children's book, has been broadcast in more than 100 countries and won numerous awards.
No-one was injured in the explosion in Cookstown on Sunday night, but the vehicle was damaged.
A police patrol said an object exploded at the rear of their car in the Drum Road area of the town, close to two hotels.
The cause of the explosion has yet to be established.
RUC superintendent Victor Hutchinson said the attack could have caused death or serious injury.
"At this point in time, everything would point to this attack being carried out by the dissident republican movement," he said.
"We had a lot of people driving between Cookstown and Omagh, so not only were my officers at risk, but also a large number of young people who were attending these functions.
Republican dissidents were blamed for a bomb attack on a police station in nearby Stewartstown last July.
A 250lb car bomb went off outside the station hours before a controversial Orange Order march at Drumcree, just 15 miles away.
No-one was injured in the blast which damaged the RUC station, businesses and scores of homes.
The dissidents are opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process.
Meanwhile, an examination of the scene of a security alert in Armagh is continuing.
On Monday army technical experts examined a suspect device found on the Monaghan Road near Armagh earlier on Monday.
The area around Brootally Cross has been cordoned off since Saturday.
Experts are warning it could be one of the worst years ever for hayfever sufferers.
The mild and windy weather has led to high levels of pollen in the air and, as pollen is the stuff that causes hayfever, it means the sneezing is starting earlier.
Have you ever had it? Hayfever includes sneezing, itching or having a blocked nose.
The Sydney Rooster, 22, recently appeared in court charged with a series of alcohol-fuelled offences, including assaulting a female police officer.
Sa, who has four caps, is due back in court on 14 October and has been stood down by both his club and country.
St George Illawarra back row forward Jeremy Smith has also pulled out with an ankle injury, joining a long list of casualties which includes Roy Asotasi, Simon Mannering, Sam Rapira, Jerome Ropati, Taniela Tuiaki, Manu Vatuvei and Sika Manu.
New Zealand play Tonga in Rotorua on 14 October in preparation for their opening Four Nations game with Australia at the Twickenham Stoop in London on 24 October.
Tickets to the swimming have been some of the hottest in town - quite literally.
There is the constant promise of home medals, the opportunity to see the one true global star of the Games and a sensational party atmosphere.
You can smell the whiff of chlorine from outside the Aquatics Centre, but that is where similarities with your local municipal end.
The temperature is sub-tropical, you just know the showers will work properly and the entertainment is not limited to a fat kid "bombing" a grandmother in the slow lane.
In stark contrast, entertainment is the buzzword poolside.
There is a fast and furious pace both in and out of the pool, with records to the fore.
Times are constantly being broken in the water, and a wide selection of vinyls help to create a breathtaking atmosphere in the stands.
The musical odyssey from Aretha Franklin to Fatboy Slim is interjected by frequent performances on the playlist of Land of Hope and Glory.
Each home medal is greeted by flag-waving pomp and circumstance more readily associated with the last night of the Proms.
Australia are the archetypal professionals of the pool.
The celebratory mood is consigned to the large contingent from down under in the stands.
By the pool, their swimmers possess an intimidating focus - so much so that even when Petria Thomas wins it is hard to see a smile.
And the green and gold also have Ian Thorpe - the biggest star of the Games.
And as a swimmer it is as if Salvador Dali daubed him with genius.
In a whirl of arms and legs those around him appear to be going backwards as Thorpe, with seemingly less effort, but more grace, pulls away.
He is a commercial godsend to the sport and in conjunction with the home haul of medals he has made swimming the place to be at these Games.
At the Sydney Olympics British athlete Jonathan Edwards described his compatriot swimmers as "awful".
"They finish their competition and stay in the village and party for the rest of the Games," he declared.
Edwards has high standards and at these Games he became only the third British athlete to hold all four major championship titles and the world record simultaneously.
But to disparage fellow athletes and to dismiss their professionalism with such contempt was misguided in the extreme.
British swimmers are winning medals and having fun at the same time - albeit in the second tier of international competition.
It is possible to win with a smile and the party at the pool is proof - even though it seems no one has told Petria Thomas.
Jonas Savimbi founded Unita - the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola - in the late 1960s as a rival movement to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which later became the government.
Savimbi's first chance of power came with the end of Portuguese colonialism in 1975.
But promised a share in a transitional government with the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and the MPLA, Unita lost out and took up arms against those two, more established, liberation movements.
Peace agreements reached in 1974, 1989 and 1991 all collapsed.
Elections were then held during a ceasefire in 1992, but Unita did not accept the results and fighting resumed.
Another attempt to find peace in 1994 with the Lusaka accord finally broke down in 1998, and the country returned to war.
The conflict in Angola is estimated to have killed more than 500,000 people, and displaced hundreds of thousands of others.
Why has the war lasted so long?
Unita's survival owed much to its alliance with apartheid South Africa, which remained at war with Angola for much of the next 15 years, and to the United States, while the Soviet Union and Cuba supported the then-Marxist MPLA.
When the support of those allies faltered with the end of the cold war, the war became a battle of oil against diamonds.
Unita funded its war almost entirely with the diamonds found on the territories it held, while the Luanda-based government relied largely on oil.
Class, race and ethnic divisions have also had their part to play in keeping the conflict alive.
For example, the Ovimbundu people, Unita supporters found mostly in the central highlands, are pitted against the coastal and Kimbundu peoples.
Does Savimbi's death mean the end of the war?
The reports of Jonas Savimbi's death come at a time when the United Nations is talking of progress towards a peaceful settlement in Angola and organisations in Angolan society were urging a bilateral ceasefire.
Observers say Mr Savimbi's death would remove a major obstacle to the establishment of peace and the achievement of the dream of co-ordinated economic development across the region.
However, Unita guerrillas remain scattered over a wide area of the country so their leader's death will not end the war automatically, says the BBC's Angola correspondent Justin Pearce.
And those who are working for a peaceful settlement will have lost the chance to negotiate with the one man who could have brought the conflict to an immediate halt.
No reason was given for Xie Zhenhua's resignation, but it follows a chemical leak which forced authorities in the city of Harbin to cut off its water.
Environmental officials in Jilin province, where an explosion caused the leak, have also been criticised for failing to act more quickly.
Harbin's water was declared safe to drink earlier this week.
The leak of the chemical benzene was caused by a blast at a chemical plant on 13 November, in the north-eastern province of Jilin.
It flowed into the Songhua river and led to a five-day shut-off of the water mains in nearby Harbin.
The State Environmental Protection Administration (Sepa), which was led by Mr Xie, said on Thursday that it did not receive notification of the spill for five days.
Mr Xie was replaced by Zhou Shengxian, former director of the State Forestry Administration, Xinhua said.
It is expected to reach Russian territory in the coming days.
World Vision UK said existing laws allowing paedophiles to be banned from going abroad must be "used more".
Other charities have called for UK police to look at bringing charges against Glitter, 61, should he return.
The ex-UK rock star, real name Paul Gadd, was jailed for three years for molesting two young girls in Vietnam.
A Vietnamese court found him guilty on Friday of abusing the girls, aged 11 and 12, at his home in the resort town of Vung Tau, southern Vietnam.
After the verdict, World Vision called for more Foreign Travel Orders - which allow for paedophiles to be banned from places where they could abuse children - to be used.
The first of the orders, introduced in 2004, was made in January 2005, but the Home Office says it has no figures on the amount used.
On his release from prison, Glitter will be deported but the Foreign Office says it will be up to Vietnam to decide if that will be back to the UK or to a different country.
Christine Beddoe, of End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking (Ecpat), urged UK police to use British sex tourism laws to bring charges against Glitter if he returns.
"We would like to see a further investigation by the British authorities to see if it would be possible to bring a prosecution against him here," she said.
In addition to his prison sentence, Glitter has been ordered to pay 5m Vietnamese dong (�180/$315) to his victims' families.
During the two-day trial, most of which was held behind closed doors, he was said to have committed a series of "lewd" acts while the girls were at his beach house in Vung Tau.
The judge later told reporters he believed Glitter understood he had "a sickness".
After he was sentenced, Glitter suggested some British newspapers were part of a conspiracy against him.
As he was led away from the courthouse and into a prison van, Glitter, sporting a white goatee beard, held a clenched fist in the air.
The ex-rock star shot to stardom in the UK in the 1970s with hits such as Rock and Roll (Part 2) and Leader of the Gang - a No 1 single in the UK in 1973.
Known for his flamboyant stage persona and extrovert costumes, he continued touring for most of the 1980s and 1990s.
Glitter may be considered for release after serving a third of his jail term, which includes the four months he has been held in custody since his arrest.
His lawyer said his client had not yet decided whether to appeal against the decision.
He had been in custody since 19 November when he was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City as he was about to board a flight out of Vietnam.
In December, Glitter's lawyer made compensatory payments to the families of the girls, who later appealed to the courts for clemency for Glitter.
He evaded more serious charges of child rape, which carry a maximum penalty of death by firing squad.
Glitter was convicted of possessing child pornography in Britain in 1999 and served half of a four-month jail sentence.
He later went to Cambodia, which permanently expelled him in December 2002 over suspected sex offences.
The response ranged from massive enthusiasm from some campaigners to near rejection from at least one finance minister.
So just what was he suggesting?
When Mr Brown raised this in St Andrews it was the financial transactions tax that really caught the eye.
Many development campaigners, groups such as Oxfam and Actionaid, have been seeking such a tax for years.
They want the funds raised to be used for aid, and an increasingly popular idea is to use the money specifically to help developing countries respond to climate change - to curb their own greenhouse emissions and to adapt to the warming that is likely to take place.
But that is not what the G20 have in mind.
There has been some support for the idea from governments, particularly France and Germany.
But the transactions tax faces an uphill struggle.
Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said it was worth discussion but it "would not be a preferred option from the Canadian point of view".
US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner was asked about the tax and insisted on showing what he called "due deference to his host" in Scotland.
So, he didn't dismiss the idea outright but nor did he offer even a hint of support.
IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn wasn't very keen either.
There are, however, other ways of raising money from the financial sector and G20 will get to grips with the IMF's ideas on how next year.
Burnley had been two minutes away from reaching Wembley as they led on the away goals rule with them 3-0 up on the night and the aggregate score at 4-4.
Robbie Blake put the Clarets ahead on the night and Chris McCann made it 2-0.
Jay Rodriguez forced extra-time with a volley, but strikes from Pavlyuchenko and Defoe won it for Spurs.
It was a devastating blow for Burnley, who had looked set to complete a sensational comeback against opponents who were rated at 1-100 to reach the final before the incredible events unfolded at Turf Moor.
Spurs will be hugely relieved, and are highly fortunate to go through after they produced a lethargic approach and some awful finishing that very nearly cost them.
Burnley had given warning that they would be no pushovers after a decent first-leg display at White Hart Lane that belied the scoreline.
And they must be given tremendous credit for their spirit, belief and desire which almost brought them a result that would have given Tottenham nightmares not suffered since 2004 when they lost 4-3 to Manchester City in the FA Cup, despite leading 3-0 at half-time and playing against 10 men.
Burnley's best chance of achieving what many people believed to be impossible was always to score early on and put Spurs under pressure.
And they were almost gifted that dream scenario when Benoit Assou-Ekotto chipped the ball back to his keeper from 30 yards out and Ben Alnwick had to scramble backwards to claw the ball wide as it threatened to sail over his head.
It seemed to set a pattern for Spurs, who proceeded to play with a lack of care.
Aside from a skidding Defoe shot, that was pushed wide by Brian Jensen, the visitors struggled to get out of their own half.
Dominating both territory and possession, Burnley must have sensed that they could at very least give the aggregate scoreline some respectability.
But it was easy to see why Burnley had won only once in their last six matches as they struggled to create any clear-cut openings.
McCann shot wide from 20 yards, while Wade Elliot tamely chipped off target from inside the box.
But then Burnley got the breakthrough their all-round play had deserved.
When Blake lined up a free-kick, he was offered a significant portion of the goal to aim at as Alnwick took up a woeful position, and the forward duly curled the ball into the space.
Just as the hosts looked to build, they lost Stephen Jordan to injury and had to replace him with Christian Kalvanes.
While the reshuffle did affect them, it was more a case of the conditions preventing Burnley dominating the match after the break.
With the strong wind against them - and Tottenham in less lethargic mood - the game had a more even feel to it.
And had Luka Modric kept his shot down, after a superb turn had earned him space, Spurs would have completely killed off Burnley's hopes of a comeback.
The Londoners got an even better chance to seal their passage to the next round when substitute Gareth Bale, on for the injured Jamie O'Hara, was clean through but he screwed his shot hopelessly wide.
Instead it had the effect of stirring the hosts into redoubling their efforts and the inspirational Blake squared to Paterson, but he blazed over.
Blake, though, was rewarded later for some superb work on the wing, where he beat two players before squaring the ball for McCann to slot in from six yards.
Now the comeback was well and truly on and Burnley piled forward in search of a third goal, which would send them through to the final on the away goals rule in extra-time.
However, it meant there was space at the back for Tottenham to exploit and they should have wrapped up the tie when Bale played in substitute Pavlyuchenko but he spooned the ball wide from close-range.
It was a miss that was to prove costly as Burnley made it 3-0 and forced extra-time when Rodriguez slammed in after Alnwick had dropped Blake's free-kick.
Yet there was to be another twist in the tale of a match that will be talked about for decades.
As the Burnley players' legs tired, Assou-Ekotto pulled the ball back to Pavlyuchenko, who smashed the ball in to put Spurs ahead on aggregate - and keep up his record of scoring in every round of the competition.
Burnley's misery was compounded when Defoe beat his marker and bent in a shot from the edge of the penalty area to seal Tottenham's date with Manchester United at Wembley.
"Nick Heidfeld eclipsed Michael Schumacher's record of consecutive Grand Prix finishes when he crossed the line for the 25th consecutive race in Barcelona.
"And that statistic tells you everything you need to know about the BMW Sauber driver; he is Mr Reliable.
"Heidfeld has made the best of a bad job with the 2009 car and has kept pumping in the points and the finishes.
"The 32-year-old is a dependable racing driver and despite BMW Sauber's exit from the sport, he might yet find himself on the 2010 grid.
We would do sports together like beach volleyball or just jump into the sea or a swimming pool.
We would definitely enjoy good food, have a nice glass of wine in the evening, which we would spend outdoors playing backgammon and just chilling out.
The Frenchwoman looked sharper and more determined than the former champion as she notched up a 6-3 6-4 victory.
Henin-Hardenne made a sluggish start and Pierce took advantage racing to the first five games on her way to the set.
The players exchanged breaks in the second but Pierce had the edge and booked her place in the quarter-finals.
Pierce got off to a lightning start on Arthur Ashe Court with some attacking play at the net.
The 12th seed quickly went 5-0 ahead but Henin-Hardenne roused herself to break back at 5-2.
But despite forcing another break-point, the Belgian could not get the set back on level terms as Pierce stayed strong.
At the start of the second set Henin-Hardenne appeared to be struggling with her hamstring and Pierce pounced on her weakness to gain a quick break.
Again, the French Open champion dug deep with some strong returns to break back.
But Pierce's superior groundstrokes and movement saw her break again in the fifth and she sealed victory with her fourth match-point.
The 30-year-old now meets compatriot Amelie Mauresmo in her third quarter-final at Flushing Meadows.
"I was playing unbelievable in the beginning," said Pierce, who recorded her first victory over Henin-Hardenne in five attempts.
"But I think she started playing better and it became tough.
A work colleague said Ms Strange had reported her head was hurting hours after the contest and was going home.
Ms Strange, 28, was found dead on Friday at her house in Rancho Cordova.
Local assistant coroner Ed Smith said initial tests showed death was "consistent with water intoxication".
Contestants were first given eight ounce (225 millilitre) bottles to drink every 15 minutes.
Mr Ybarra said he quit after five bottles but remaining contestants started on larger bottles.
"She was telling me about her family and her three kids and how she was doing it for her kids," Mr Ybarra said.
The station said its staff were stunned at the death.
Some health and safety rules, for instance, only affect firms with five or more staff.
Fledgling businesses have become increasingly strident about the burden of red tape since Labour came to power.
The latest research, chaired by Lord Haskins, chairman of Northern Food, will no doubt prove a further embarrassment for ministers.
Lord Haskins said the main problem was that firms were more concerned with survival when they first started up in business.
The task force says the answer to the problem is not to exempt small firms from the rules, but to give them compensation for the extra work involved.
The film combines live action with computer-generated images and stars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr and Rowan Atkinson.
"The interaction between the human and CGI characters is jerkily unconvincing, and James Gunn's script is painfully lacking in invention and wit," says the BBC's Neil Smith.
The 71-year-old singer was admitted to Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, on 10 March.
He was released on Tuesday night, said hospital spokesman Jennifer Jackson.
Cash suffers from a condition called autonomic neuropathy, a disease of the nervous system that makes him susceptible to pneumonia and bronchitis.
The condition has led to recurrent bouts of both illnesses and the star has been in and out of hospital since 1998.
Known as the Man in Black - due to his favoured colour of clothing - Cash is considered the inspiration for a generation of country music singers.
His hits include A Boy Named Sue, Ring of Fire and A Thing Called Love.
Cash has sold more than 50 million records during a career spanning five decades and has won eight Grammy Awards.
He has since lent his distinctive bass tones to songs about coal miners, convicts and cowboys.
In a life shadowed by drug and alcohol problems, Cash was once fined $85,000 (�58,000) for starting a forest fire.
He is the only person to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
The research, published in the journal Science, also reinforces predictions made last year that rising temperatures - if they persist - could clear the mountain's ice completely within two decades.
This could cause difficulties for local people whose economies depend in part on the melt waters coming from the mountain and who also benefit from the influx of tourists drawn to the beauty of the white-capped tropical peak.
Professor Lonnie Thompson, from Ohio State University, US, collected six cores from the mountain.
The ice columns were investigated for deposits trapped in the yearly snowfalls that built up the glaciers.
The cores show much of the past 11,000 years to have been generally wetter and warmer than present, but they also show evidence for three major droughts - 8,300, 5,200 and 4,000 years ago - the last of which went on for 300 years.
By using global positioning from satellites, aerial maps and an array of stakes placed on the ice fields, the researchers have been able to confirm that Kilimanjaro's white cap is retreating in extent and volume.
"If you look at the area on the maps in between you have a series of dots that line up.
But colleague Dr Douglas Hardy, from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, also US, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about global warming.
"Evidence is mounting that human influences on climate are causing glaciers to retreat dramatically around the world, and especially at high elevations in the tropics.
"But Kilimanjaro's glaciers have little in common with mid-latitude Alpine glaciers, and we must accept that simple explanations are not always possible.
Two - or more - head teachers are better than one, it seems.
But can this approach really help eradicate problems such as truancy, violence, bullying and plain old naughtiness in class?
Christine Quinn, head teacher of Ninestiles Technology College in Birmingham, thinks it can.
Her school has formed a federation with two other secondaries nearby - Waverley Hall and the International School and College.
The three of them share simple rules, such as listening in class and bringing pens and rulers to lessons, which all pupils are told to follow.
Posters on most walls remind them to toe the line or face punishment.
Ms Quinn is at pains to suggest that simplicity, rather than some draconian urge for control, is at the heart of the "Behaviour for Learning" policy.
"We want to give teachers the space to teach and learners the space to learn.
Parents, as well as children, are reminded of their responsibilities.
Such was its progress that it was chosen as an example for Waverley and the International School to follow.
Waverley became affiliated in 2001 and the five "good" GCSEs or equivalent pass rate has gone from 14% to 61%.
For the International School, which joined in 2003, the figure went from 9% to 34% in 2004 - almost a four-fold increase in just a year.
It is all very well one school improving, but how does it transmit its "ethos" of success?
The three federation schools differ from most in having an over-arching, "executive" head, Sir Dexter Hutt.
Ms Quinn acknowledges that the parts of Birmingham they cover are not full of "leafy lanes" but suffer problems associated with economic deprivation.
However, she thinks other schools, in other circumstances, can still share ideas and behaviour policies.
During the last year, representatives from around 70 other schools have visited federation members to find out what they are getting right.
The Foreign Office is reviewing plans for Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, to meet senior figures and promote trade.
The visit - planned for early September - now seems unlikely to go ahead.
It also emerged that the prime minister had written to Colonel Gaddafi asking that Libya "act with sensitivity" when Megrahi returned home.
Downing Street said Gordon Brown had sent the letter on Thursday, ahead of the bomber's release from prison.
Foreign Secretary David Miliband has described the celebratory welcome in Libya for Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi as "deeply distressing".
BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James Robbins said he understood the royal visit - which had not yet been made public - was now unlikely to proceed.
"It would be the Duke of York's third visit to Libya," he said.
"Last year he met Colonel Gaddafi and previously he has met a series of senior Libyan ministers in his role as Britain's special representative for trade and investment.
Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said that the decision had been made "for the right reasons"
The Duke's spokesman said a trip to Libya in early September had been "in its planning stages".
The foreign secretary has said he deplored the welcome Megrahi received in Tripoli on Thursday.
But Mr Miliband refused to comment on whether he believed the Scottish Government was right to free him.
Crowds in Tripoli, some waving Saltires, greeted Megrahi after he was freed on compassionate grounds.
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the reception was "inappropriate".
The welcome Megrahi received on his return to Libya also prompted an angry reaction from families of those killed in the 1988 bombing, which brought down Pan Am flight 103 over the town of Lockerbie, in southern Scotland.
US President Barack Obama described the Scottish Government's decision to free Megrahi as a "mistake" and said his administration had told the Libyan government that Megrahi, who has terminal cancer, should not receive a hero's welcome and should instead be placed under house arrest.
Mr Miliband, the first UK minister to comment on Megrahi's release, said the scenes in Tripoli were deeply distressing.
He said there had been no pressure from Westminster on the Scottish Government to release Megrahi.
Mr Salmond said the welcome received by Megrahi was "unwise".
He said he supported Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill's decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds, and denied it had damaged Scotland's relationship with the United States.
The Scottish Parliament is to be recalled on Monday to discuss the controversial decision to release Megrahi.
Russell Brown, Labour MP for Dumfries, said seeing the Saltire at Tripoli airport was "stomach churning" and condemned the Scottish Government for failing to seek adequate assurances that the Lockerbie bomber would not be hailed a hero on his return to Libya.
"This man is convicted of murdering 270 people in my part of Scotland and that conviction stands.
David Mundell, Conservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said the scenes from Tripoli were "sickening".
Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced the release order on Thursday afternoon, saying Megrahi probably had about three months to live.
The fact that Megrahi's victims were shown no compassion was "not a reason for us to deny compassion to him and his family in his final days", he said.
The crew mates of Patrick McCabe, 61, from Dundalk, County Louth, told how they desperately tried to save him on 1 November last year.
His body was carried across the Irish Sea to a remote Lleyn Peninsula beach where it was discovered three weeks later on 26 November.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded.
Mr McCabe's body was only found, the inquest in Llangefni heard, because environment agency worker David Arwyn Williams happened to be working at the isolated spot near Criccieth.
Mr Williams said the next high tide would have washed the body out to sea again.
Cousins Peter and Vincent Mulligan, part-owners of the Boyn Harvester fishing vessel, told how they were on their second fishing trip of the day on 1 November last year when Mr McCabe fell overboard.
Vincent Mulligan said he saw Mr McCabe kneeling near the fishing equipment, then he saw "his legs go over the back of the boat".
Vincent Mulligan said he called to Peter Mulligan to reverse the boat to where their crew mate had fallen overboard.
They got as close as they could and tried to throw him a life buoy, he said.
At one stage it looked as if the rope was "between his hands" said Vincent Mulligan, but then he "just disappeared".
Coroner Nicola Jones told the inquest she was satisfied that Mr McCabe was "competent and sufficiently experienced for the fishing trip undertaken".
Although there was nothing to say why he fell off, it would seem that he had simply lost his balance, she added.
"I am satisfied the Mulligans reacted quickly and did everything they could to get him back into the boat," she said.
Recording a verdict of death by accident she told Mr McCabe's family that fishing was a dangerous occupation and that she hoped the fact that his body had been found was a "crumb of comfort".
Gavin finds out about the dramatic rescue
Five adults and six children were swimming at Mawgan Porth beach near Newquay on Sunday 2 August when hidden tides pulled them out of their depth.
Thankfully there were four lifeguards on the beach, who were able to get to the group and save them.
The children had been swimming where the flags said they were allowed to, but the current - called a rip current - still caught hold of them.
David Haye and Nikolay Valuev weigh-in for their WBA heavyweight fight in Nuremberg, with boxing promoter Don King predicting a victory for the giant Russian.
A Robbie Fowler dinked finish and John Arne Riise's powerful left-foot shot put Liverpool firmly in control on the stroke of half-time.
Gabriel Paletta glanced in his first goal for Liverpool just after the break before Andre Bikey headed one back.
Peter Crouch appeared to seal the win at 4-1 but Leroy Lita and Shane Long made it a thrilling finish at Anfield.
The late drama threatened to spoil a fine performance from Liverpool and in particular Fowler, their skipper for the evening.
He scored his first goal since the first day of the season in just his third appearance of the campaign.
Shortly before half-time he added to his impressive record in the League Cup, scoring his 21st goal in 23 appearances in the competition.
He ran on to a pass from Jermaine Pennant and produced the sort of finish seen so often by an adoring crowd of more than 42,000.
That came in the 44th minute but the Reds even had time to double their lead before the interval when Riise lashed in at the second attempt after Stack had kept out his first effort.
The Reds appeared to have the tie settled five minutes into the second period when Pennant's corner from the left found Paletta, who glanced a header into the far corner.
Fowler had chances to add to the scoreline before Bikey headed powerfully in from Glen Little's free-kick.
But their hopes of mounting a serious threat seemed to end three minutes later when Fowler set up strike partner Crouch, who bamboozled Stack with some dazzling footwork to walk in the fourth.
For the second time in four days following Sunday's defeat to Arsenal the Royals had conceded four, but to their credit they battled on and John Halls set up Lita to sidefoot home.
With time running out it looked little more than a consolation until Little and Long combined to make it 4-3 in the 84th minute.
Dirk Kuyt volleyed against the bar and then Fowler was twice denied by the woodwork as they searched for a fifth Liverpool goal, but their defence also survived some nervy goalmouth scrambles to go through to the next stage.
"It was a fantastic game for the people, it is normally not for manager but for supporters.
"We've got a big game on Saturday and a long trip back and I'm sure Mr Benitez was thinking the same about extra-time.
"So I was pleased with the performance but not with the result.
BBC Sport has learned Chelsea will announce Mourinho as their new manager on Tuesday on a four-year-deal.
Mourinho is said to have already told Porto he intends to take over at Stamford Bridge if the terms are right.
Current boss Claudio Ranieri will hold talks with Chelsea in the next three days to resolve his future.
And it is believed the 41-year-old wants the contract with Chelsea to be completed as soon as possible in case there is a backlash from Porto fans.
But although the financial terms are not an issue, Mourinho will not rush into signing until he receives assurances from Blues owner Roman Abramovich that he will be in sole charge of team affairs.
"I will speak to the Porto president and I hope he respects my wish to leave.
Ranieri held a meeting with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and chief executive Peter Kenyon at a hotel in Milan, Italy, on Thursday.
It seems certain now that the Italian will give way to Mourinho as coach - with Ranieri either leaving altogether or moving into a director of football role.
Kenyon said on Wednesday "the situation should be resolved next week".
Meanwhile Mourinho will leave Porto in the knowledge he made them the first club since Liverpool in 1976 and 1977 to win the Uefa Cup and European Cup in successive years.
The Portuguese club reportedly want Chievo coach Luigi del Neri to take over from Mourinho.
Winter Olympics guide - Curling rules and tactics
But instead of rooks or pawns, custom-made stones and mini brooms are a curler's weapons of choice.
The result is enough tactical intrigue to keep all Kasparov wannabes fascinated.
Curling actually originated in 16th-century Scotland, but it took the gold medal heroics of Rhona Martin and her team in Salt Lake City in 2002 to bring the sport to a wider audience in the UK.
The aim is to end the game with your stone, or stones, closest to the centre (or tee) of a target zone called the house.
Pushing off from a rubber foothold called the hack, the shooter slides forward holding the stone.
The stone must be released before the shooter crosses a point called the hog line.
The sweepers can only sweep in the area between two lines called tee lines.
The captain, or 'skip', sorts out the tactics, and is the last to throw in a round or an 'end'.
The first two players in each team may not displace opponents' stones if they are in an area called the guard zone.
The game finishes when all four players on each team have thrown their two stones.
The team with the stone closest to the tee wins, with a point awarded for each stone closer to the tee than the opponent's closest stone.
After 10 ends, the team with the highest score wins.
The Olympic competition uses a round robin format, with all 10 teams playing against each other once.
The top four qualify for the semi-finals, with the first-placed team from the round robin playing the fourth-placed one, and second taking on third.
The two semi-final winners advance to the gold medal match, while the two losers play off for bronze.

Boonrawd Somtat said the emergency powers would be lifted in 41 of the country's 76 provinces, as suggested by coup leader Sonthi Boonyaratglin.
Martial law would remain in areas still considered unstable, mostly along the borders, Mr Boonrawd added.
Martial law has been in place since the coup on 19 September.
The decision now goes to King Bhumibol Adulyadej for his final approval.
Mr Boonrawd told reporters that martial law would remain in 35 provinces "due to both domestic and foreign security concerns, as well as concerns about drug smuggling and illegal immigration".
"Martial law will remain in some provinces on the borders and some areas in the interior of the country," he added.
He said the emergency powers would be lifted in Bangkok and nearby provinces "because we care about the international community and tourism".
But they will remain in Chiang Mai and two other towns in northern Thailand, where support for ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is strongest.
Coup leader and army commander General Sonthi Boonyaratglin recommended on Monday that martial law should be lifted in parts of the country.
"Everybody wants to see peace and order in our country and the lifting of martial law will have a positive political and psychological impact," he said.
The new government has struggled to gain international recognition, not least because of its refusal to end the martial law, the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says.
But in practice few Thais have felt the restrictions, which have been applied sparingly, and there have been relatively few protests against martial law.
The fact martial law remains in place in pro-Thaksin areas suggests the military is still nervous about a possible come-back by the former prime minister, who has been touring a number of nearby countries recently in a blaze of media publicity, our correspondent adds.
Hollywood stars Zeta Jones and Douglas had signed an exclusive �1m photo deal with rival magazine OK! to publish photos of their 2000 wedding.
In April the High Court ordered Hello! to pay more than �1m damages, after it published six unauthorised shots.
Hello! is disputing whether it should pay damages to the magazine or stars.
Lawyer for Hello! Chris Hutchings told BBC News Online the magazine was appealing initially over whether it should be liable to pay damages.
Only 15,000 copies of the magazine, featuring paparazzi shots, went on sale before OK!'s publication, he said.
In April Mr Justice Lindsay ruled Hello!'s pictures had been a breach of commercial confidence.
He ordered it to pay �1,033,156 to OK!, and a further �14,500 in damages to the Hollywood couple.
Mr Hutchings said there was "nothing confidential" once the OK! story was published, and that allowing a publisher to have continuing exclusivity on a story in the public domain had "serious implications".
If Hello! was unsuccessful in this appeal, Mr Hutchings said, it would appeal over the amount of damages it has been ordered to pay OK! He said the magazine wanted the amount "massively reduced".
He said Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones had also appealed over two aspects of the case.
They had wanted to bring Hello! contributor Marquesa De Varela back in to court, but Mr Lindsay refused.
The couple were only awarded �14,500 in damages for breach of confidence.
The appeal is expected to take place later this year.
Previously they had to rely on a series of spot measurements across an earthquake zone.
The new data on rock movements comes from satellites that bounce radar signals across a wide swathe of the Earth's surface.
The new insight may provide a way to study earthquake zones and predict when and where quakes may strike.
The earthquake that provided the new information took place on 16 October 1999 in California.
Yuri Fialko of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, US, says the research provides a new way to identify potentially active faults, and perhaps a better understanding of the earthquake process.
Dr Fialko says the earthquake was the first one to be comprehensively imaged using so-called synthetic aperture radar that reveals minute details of the fault's movements.
According to a paper in the journal Science the fresh data has given researchers a new window into earthquake processes.
"Even small stress perturbations from distant earthquakes can cause faults to move a little bit, but it's only been known to cause this motion in a forward sense," says Dr Fialko.
The data also suggests that rocks in fault zones are more pliable that the rocks that surround them.
"Measurements of changes in the mechanical properties of faults may yield valuable information about the earthquake cycle.
For example, we might be able to say how long it was before the fault experienced an earthquake and how long it takes to heal," he says.
North of Burnham in Buckinghamshire, the crowded M4 corridor gives way quickly to rolling wooded hills, barn conversions and "Keep Hunting" posters.
Hidden from the roads, craftsmen work to recreate a remarkable house, in the middle of a still more remarkable park.
Lord Grenville - the prime minister who pushed through the law abolishing the slave trade - bought the core of the Buckinghamshire estate in 1792 when it was occupied by a labourer's cottage.
The house he had built by architects Samuel Wyatt and Charles Tatham - and the grounds with their extraordinary garden buildings and matchless collection of conifers - were for Grenville a refuge from politics.
He praised it as "deep sheltered from the world's tempestuous strife" - but here also some of the meetings were held by which politics were conducted in the age of powdered wigs and great men's shifting alliances.
Grenville's house and park were left ruined, prey to vandals, thieves, vegetation, muntjac deer and rabbits.
Mary Trevallion, who lives opposite the gates to the site, tells of encounters with people entering Dropmore and making off with stone, ironwork and fittings.
"We spiked the back of the gates so that you couldn't open them - but we did that because otherwise it was open house," she says.
The ways through the pinetum are blocked by undergrowth; the garden aviary and Greek temples built of trellis are shabby and neglected.
Now, the house and surrounding buildings have been acquired by property company Corporate Estates and are being reconstructed as luxury dwellings, under the severe conditions that apply to a Grade I listed building.
A conservation plan is also being developed to restore the gardens and grounds.
By the time Grenville died in 1834, his pinetum contained the biggest collection of conifer species in Britain - the plan is to use what survives as the basis for a collection of some 200 species.
The plan, extending 15 years and more into the future, also includes restoration of the formal flower beds, Italian garden, woodlands, lawns, vistas, roads, bridges and gates.
A key element is "the renovation of garden structures such as pavilions, a stunning Chinese aviary, the massive framework of trelliswork and pergolas," says Lionel Fanshawe of landscape architects Terra Firma.
Within the house, rebuilding has brought a series of discoveries, says George Kalopedis, architect on the Dropmore project.
One example was Grenville's study - an octagonal double-height room that had disappeared in the later conversions.
During the rebuilding, the foundations of this room were found - now it will be reconstructed as part of the Grenville Suite, one of the most prestigious apartments.
Mr Brushe keeps a benevolent but strict eye on the rebuilding work, with the authority the Grade I listed status gives him.
He hunts for breeze blocks where reconstruction should be in bricks like those of the original, orders windows removed from the roof when they are in the wrong place, and seeks out pictures of rooms in existing houses similar to those Grenville had.
William Wilberforce wrote to Grenville that success over abolition was mainly due to "yourself, and the tone you have taken and the exertions you have made".
For his memorial, on the anniversary of abolition, Grenville would undoubtedly have chosen Dropmore.
She feels there have been really positive changes in recent years - both in the courts and in society.
But both players started in Chelsea's Premier League win over Manchester United on Tuesday night.
So are managers too soft on their top players? Are some players not getting the right punishments for their actions?
Maybe you think that some big footy stars could do with a good telling off? Or perhaps you reckon that it's fine for top players to act however they like?
Whatever you think, we want to know!
Search, find and watch the politics that affects you
Investigations into the NIFRS were carried out following whistle-blowing claims which centred on fraud, unapproved bonuses and the failure to deal with staff grievances.
In October, Health Minister Edwin Poots said the reviews were commissioned and an interim chief executive was appointed because "it was clear that robust intervention was needed".
NIFRS interim chief executive Jim Wallace said the basis on which any discipline would be undertaken would be based on the evidence.
"My own view, from interpreting the report's recommendations as they stood, for me, there was not sufficient evidence on the face of the reports to warrant or pursue discipline," he said.
He said that an independent external reviewer would access this.
"What the overview will give us, is some assurance that either I've got it wrong, or indeed that my initial reaction to them is indeed correct," he added.
The SDLP's Conall McDevitt questioned what evidence would be required for disciplinary action.
"The overwhelming majority of the allegations made have been proven to be either partly or substantially true, therefore, how much more evidence do you need before you would take action to deal with the individuals responsible?" he asked.
Dr Joe McKee, chairman of the NIFRS Board, said they were addressing their actions on the professional recommendations that came from the internal auditor's report and the Department of Health.
"None specify that there are disciplinary actions to be taken against staff," he said.
Dr McKee said he was "acutely aware" of many of the serious issues raised in the recent whistle-blower report and had approached this "head-on by taking the unprecedented step" of splitting the roles of chief fire officer and chief executive.
He said the overall corporate management team had three non-uniform directors and he hoped a further two positions would be filled by the end of March 2013.
"That will be a significant improvement in the governance in the organisation," he said.
Health committee chairwoman Sue Ramsey it was vital that people were held responsible.
"It's important that we send out a clear message that what was done was done, people are going to be held accountable and people, if necessary, are going to be disciplined and we ensure that it can't happen again," she said.
Trundle said his performance in the home defeat to Rotherham two days earlier was his worst of the season.
Trundle has scored 20 League One goals this season, but 17 of those came before mid-November.
Swansea desperately need the 29-year-old to rediscover his early-season form as they aim for the two victories that should guarantee a play-off spot.
"We've got two games to get a play-off place so we've got to put points on the board," said Trundle, who expects to be in the staring line-up to face Southend at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday.
"'We can do it - we've proved before that we can beat anyone - and our fans can play a massive part.
Scrum V's Wales v Scotland analysis
The back-row was arrested with another man at 0540 GMT on Sunday at services off junction 33 of the M4 near the team hotel in the Vale of Glamorgan.
That was hours after he played in the dramatic 31-24 win over Scotland.
Phillips revealed Powell has apologised to Wales' management and was also asked to apologise to the hotel management before being asked to leave the squad.
"Andy knows he has misbehaved and is apologetic, but he also knows that he must take responsibility for his own actions and accept the repercussions.
"This kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated in a professional, elite sporting environment and we have acted quickly and incisively in order to leave no ambiguity over the dim view we take of this situation.
"The player has made his private apologies to the Welsh management team as well as apologising in a public statement and we have also asked him to apologise to the Vale Resort Hotel, before asking him to leave the squad.
"It seems, albeit from a distance, to have been a prank that has somehow gone dreadfully wrong with potentially very serious implications.
On Sunday's Scrum V, ex-Wales captains Phil Bennett, Robert Jones and Mike Hall suggested this may spell the end of his Wales career.
"I think he [Powell] has gone," former British and Irish Lions three-quarter Hall told BBC Wales' Scrum V rugby programme.
"I don't see him featuring against France at all and I don't think this management team will put up with it.
"It's without question [enough reason to be dropped from the squad], an extremely stupid thing to do.
Powell faced the Wales team management on Monday.
The player was also bailed on Monday morning and will appear in court next month charged with drink driving.
Brecon-born Powell, 28, has won 14 caps and toured with the Lions squad to South Africa last summer after a breakthrough season for Wales.
The Cardiff Blues man has been a favourite of Gatland's and last season he displaced Wales captain Ryan Jones from his favoured number eight position before being chosen ahead of his national skipper for the Lions tour.
But this season Jones has regained his favoured eight jersey meaning that Powell has been moved to the blind-side flank.
His position may have been under threat before the buggy incident, with many fans and pundits calling for Jonathan Thomas to take the number six jersey.
Former Scotland scrum-half Bryan Redpath told Scrum V that playing Powell out of position was having a knock-on effect on open-side flanker Martyn Williams' effectiveness, and Bennett and Jones agreed that changes should be made.
"Powell was struggling to stay in the team on form anyway," former Wales and Lions fly-half Bennett told Scrum V.
"[Against Scotland] we were devastated by their back row.
"What is the job of a six? He's there to hit rucks, to do all the donkey work and to carry tightly and effectively, and that balance isn't quite right.
Scrum V looks ahead to Wales v France
The cross-party campaign to keep Scotland in the UK is being launched.
The focus of the campaign will be on what "binds us together".
"The more you look at this, the more advantages there are in terms of trade, business, prosperity," he said.
Mohammed Yusuf wanted to impose a strict version of Islamic law
Mr Yusuf led Boko Haram, which wants to overthrow the government and impose a strict version of Islamic law.
Hundreds of people have died in five days of clashes between his followers and security forces.
Mr Yusuf was held and later shot in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri.
A BBC reporter in the city was among journalists shown two films, one apparently showing Mr Yusuf making a confession; the other showing what appeared to be his body, riddled with bullets.
"Mohammed Yusuf was killed by security forces in a shootout while trying to escape," the regional police assistant inspector-general, Moses Anegbode, told Nigerian television.
A spokesman for the state governor was also quoted as saying that Mr Yusuf had been trying to escape.
Troops had stormed Boko Haram's stronghold on Wednesday night, killing many of the militants and forcing others to flee.
Mr Yusuf was arrested earlier on Thursday, after reportedly being found hiding in a goat pen at his parents-in-law's house.
BBC News website Africa editor Joseph Winter says Nigeria's security forces have a terrible reputation for brutality and human rights groups accuse them of frequent extra-judicial killings.
Officials working for Human Rights Watch in Nigeria said there should be an immediate investigation into the killing, which they called "extrajudicial" and "illegal".
The violence began on Sunday night in Bauchi state, before spreading to other towns and cities in the northeast of the west African nation.
Crowds of militants tried to storm government buildings and the city's police headquarters, but dozens of them were shot dead by security forces.
Several days of gun battles between militants and Nigerian security forces ensued, culminating in the assault on the militant's stronghold.
It is thought more than 300 people have died in the violence - some estimates say 600, although there has been no official confirmation.
The Red Cross said about 3,500 people had fled the fighting and were being housed in their camp.
Witnesses and human rights groups have accused the military of excessive violence in quelling the militants, but the army says it used a minimal amount of force.
Police say Mr Yusuf was a 39-year-old preacher from Yobe state, who had four wives and 12 children.
They described him as a motivational character.
Sharia law is in place across northern Nigeria, but there is no history of al-Qaeda-linked violence.
The country's 150 million people are split almost equally between Muslims in the north and Christians in the south.
Dr Slepian had been the target of anti-abortion protestors for morethan a decade but he had always vowed not to be deterred by them.
The shooting bore striking similarities to attacks carried out over the last four years on four other doctors in the area, though none of them were killed.
Earlier this week abortion clinic workers in up state New York and southern Canada were warned to take extra care.
President Clinton has issued a statement saying the nation cannot tolerate violence directed at those providing a constitutionally-protected medical service.
"No matter where we stand on the issue of abortion, all Americans must stand together in condemning this tragic and brutal act," he said.
Two other doctors have been murdered in the last five years but DrSlepian is the first to be killed at his home.
The National Organisation of Women has described the latest murder as domestic terrorism and called for more resources to protect doctors who carry out abortions.
A spokeswoman said it signalled an escalation of violence.
New York's Governor, George Pataki, says the perpetrator should receive the death penalty.
Radio Times magazine said Deep Throat was "the worst film to have major influence", but that it took "porn out of the back room and into the cinema".
Made in 1972, it was the first pornographic film widely seen in cinemas, earning $600m (�320m).
The list, for the Radio Times Guide to Films 2007, also includes Citizen Kane, Psycho, Pulp Fiction and Shrek.
The film was banned in 23 US states on its release, and UK censors only passed an uncut version in 2000.
Computer-generated fantasy Shrek and last year's gay cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain are the only films released since 2000 on the list.
Disney's first full-length feature from 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, is included.
The Beatles' 1964 film A Hard Day's Night is credited as a forerunner of modern music videos.
Meanwhile, Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster Jaws is said to have "redefined the marketing for all future event movies".
UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari announced the decision after a Vienna meeting of the international grouping negotiating Kosovo's future status.
The Contact Group had earlier pledged a decision on Kosovo by the end of 2006.
The ultra-nationalist Radical Party dominates the Serbian parliament and is fiercely opposed to independence for Kosovo.
Earlier on Friday the Serbian President, Boris Tadic, called legislative elections for 21 January.
Serbian voters have already approved a new constitution asserting that Kosovo is an integral part of the country.
Kosovo has been under UN control since 1999 - the year that a Nato bombing campaign forced Serbia to pull its forces out of the province.
Serbia became an independent country earlier this year when its union with neighbouring Montenegro was formally dissolved.
The Contact Group on Kosovo is made up of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the US.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu voiced "deep regret" over the UN's delay, but said the ethnic Albanian leadership was confident that Kosovo would achieve independence.
"We're particularly disturbed that this delay is linked to the parliamentary elections in Serbia," he said, quoted by the Associated Press.
The International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention think-tank, warned that the Kosovo final status process "could break down if the decision is pushed much into 2007".
It said any additional delay "would open a new destabilising chapter" and "the longer the Kosovo Albanians are forced to wait, the greater the chance they will discredit themselves with unilateral independence moves or riots".
Tests in mice have shown the drug, PBT2, prevents build up of the amyloid protein linked to the disease.
Protein levels dropped by 60% within 24 hours of a single dose, and memory performance improved within five days.
A team from Australia's Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, who are behind the research, hope the drug could be on the market in four years.
Human tests are due to start next month, followed by a major international trial next year.
Already preliminary tests in humans have showed the drug does not cause any major side-effects.
The researchers believe the drug has the potential to delay the onset of disease, or slow down its progression.
It is linked to the build up of deposits of amyloid protein - called Abeta - in the brain, which form plaques often seen in the brains of Alzheimer's patients at post mortem.
The Australian researchers showed that PBT2 therapy quickly and significantly improved spatial memory in mice.
They used a water-maze test which involved the mice remembering the location of a submerged platform in order to navigate the maze.
His colleague Professor George Fink, head of the Mental Health Research Institute, described the research as a major breakthrough.
Dr Sorenson said the results of the PBT2 study were one of many encouraging discoveries presented at last week's International Convention for Alzheimer's Disease which showed positive steps were being made towards finding new and better treatments.
Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said PBT2 was related to Clioquinol, an ointment used to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot.
She said "Scientists still have a lot of work to do before a drug could be available for patients.
"Much more research is needed even to see whether preventing the amyloid build-up is really a true benefit for patients.
Rifaat al-Assad is furious that the ruling Ba'ath party has already nominated Bashar, 34, as successor to Mr Assad who died on Saturday.
President Assad's funeral promises to be elaborate affair, beginning in Damascus on Tuesday at 0800 (0500 GMT) and ending in the evening 200 km (125 miles) to the northwest at his home village of Qardaha where he will be buried.
Mr Assad died of a heart attack on Saturday aged 69.
Foreign dignitaries have been arriving in Syria, with President Omar El Bashir of Sudan first to arrive.
In Damascus, hundreds of thousands of banners and portraits of Mr Assad and his two sons are on buildings, cars and motorcycles.
Black cloth has been sold by the metre to drape on buildings - some mourners have even cut themselves to express their sorrow in keeping with Shiite Muslim tradition.
He was stripped of the title of vice-president two years ago, and a newspaper said on Monday the Syrian authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest.
So far there has been no sign of dissension inside Syria about elevating Bashar, an eye doctor who has never held a major political post.
State television has also shown senior military officers, led by the defence minister, General Mustafa Tlas, pledging allegiance to Bashar, who has been promoted to take charge of the armed forces.
